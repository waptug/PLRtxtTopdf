Wild Turkey Inn


One of the most unusual bed and breakfasts is found in historic Galena, Illinois. This is a nature lovers delight. The Wild Turkey bed and breakfast uses a farmhouse theme. Set on 26 acres of some of Illinois most scenic land. Flocks of wild turkeys roost in the trees surrounding the farmhouse. The neighbors are very quiet. Sitting on the back porch you can watch the deer and many varieties of birds that live in the abundant trees and dine from the many feeders below. The wild turkey is so passionate about the wildlife that its three bedrooms are named after some of the local variety of birds.

On the first floor is the bluebird room. The three-piece Eastlake bedroom set is adorned with a hand made quilt on the queen size bed. For convenience, there is a private attached bath. Moving upstairs we find the Cardinal. One of the more unusual features here is the fact that it can accommodate two or three people since there is a twin bed in addition to the queen sized one. This room is fully adorned with antiques. Like the bluebird it has a private bath just one step outside the room. For a gorgeous view of the valley, step into the Gold Finch room. All oak furnishings accent the queen-sized bed. 

Relax on the deck or take your coffee to the screened in porch. After a hearty breakfast, hike down to the pond and contemplate trying to catch some of the big mouth bass or just take in the breathtaking view. For a real challenge, there is always biking with through the hilly terrain, they even furnish the bikes. During the summer months swimming is available at the pond or nearby is a heated pool. This is horse country so nearby is Shenandoah riding center.
