Have you ever tried eating at a  fast food chain? These restaurants have one thing in common, the food tastes the same irregardless the location. Do you wonder why? They cook the chicken at a certain temperature, for a certain a mount of time and they serve it with a smile. This is their system! 

A system they apply to every single store they have. When you buy a franchise from them you need to follow their system, you would not want to experiment because you know that their system works. Thats why anyone who buys a franchise, are actually after their money making system, not the food. 

The same is true with network marketing, you must create a system that is duplicatable that if you pass it to your network, it will give them the chance to achieve the same level of success.  

The Advantages of a System in Network Marketing

1.Simplifies your work - With a system you make your work easier because you already know what you are suppose to do every single day. A system is just like your daily to-do list. You have your goals and since you have a system you know what you have to do to get there. 
Another reason why a system helps simplify your work, is because the bigger your network becomes the more complicated it gets, what could work for a group of 200 could not work for a group of 2000. 
2. More Profitable – With a system you make your network marketing business more profitable. Let me tell you why.
When your system works and you start earning big because of it the next step you should do is teach your system to the people under your network. You're probably telling yourself that a great system should be kept a secret so that people don't steal it from you. But let me tell you something “SHARE your system to the people under your network” Why? Because if you help your downlines earn more, you earn more also. Help them in becoming better network marketers and you build a stronger network.

Now that you know the advantages of creating a system in network marketing, you should start creating one. A system always works to your advantage, it does not have negative effects on your business as long as you set it up right from the start of your network marketing career. A good leader should be able to set it up even before he starts on his journey to success in the world of network marketing. But since its not easy to set-up a system, you need someone to guide you and help you make it.
