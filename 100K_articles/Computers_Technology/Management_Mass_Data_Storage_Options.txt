Mass storage is a way for individuals or businesses to store sucessfully a large amount of data. The most common form of mass data storage is on computer drives. The most popular storage devices are:

• Floppy disks
• Hard disks
• CD-Roms
• USB ports

According to Webopedia, mass storage devices still hold information even when the computer or operating system is not powered on. 

A common device for organizing management mass data storage is the CD-ROM Disc. Although CD-style discs come in a wide variety brands, all kinds resemble a music CD or DVD in their appearance. There are some discs that only record data once. Many times, these discs are referred to as "read only" discs. "CDRWs" is a common name for discs that can have data erased and re-entered on the disc over and over again. CD-ROM Discs are popular because they are portable, which means they can be removed from the CD-ROM drive that reads and stores data on them. CD-ROM drives are generally tagged with a speed number; for example, 4x. Many CD discs are also associated with a speed number. Technology has allowed these speeds to increase, and are making storing and retrieving data from a CD disc much easier and faster. 

Floppy disks were, and still are, a popular way to store and transfer important data. Although management mass data storage is generally used for large businesses, many individuals or families use floppy disks as a way to store their important personal information. Floppy disks work specifically with disk drives that can be found on most standard computer operating systems. A floppy disk is convenient, because it is portable and can be removed from the floppy drive and stored someplace safe. Handling the management mass data storage is easy for companies and individuals with a floppy disk. 

Hard disk are another common and secure way to manage and store mass amounts of data. The majority of computers sold today have hard disks. Many larger businesses or computer networks have at least one, and at times, multiple hard disks drives. a hard disk is often compared to a traditional cassette tape, because both use special magnetic recording. This magnetic recording process allows for the data to be stored, copied, or even erased. 

USB ports is another management mass data storage device. The USB port allows external devices to be connected to many standard operating systems. This allows data to be retrieved, copied, or stored from a source outside the computer. Various kinds of media equipment use the USB ports on a computer. For instance, many MP3 players, iPods, video cameras, and digital cameras can be connected to a computer by a USB cable. It is possible to purchase external CD drivers or external hard drives. These items are often used when an operating system may not have a hard drive installed, or if additional space is needed. 

Windows, Mac, and other electronic operating systems generally have one at least one kind of management mass data storage, and some have a combination of different storage options. operating and maintaining of management mass data storage is a safe and efficien way to eliminate paper filing systems or and the overuse of traditional, handwritten materials.
