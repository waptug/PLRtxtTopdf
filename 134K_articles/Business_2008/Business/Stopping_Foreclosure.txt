You also need to know the technical details about foreclosure in order to determine the exact steps you need to take in order to prevent the foreclosure of your mortgaged properties. Foreclosure is a process in which a certain bank or a secured creditor sells or tries to repossess a piece of property. This occurs when the owner of the property is unable to or has failed to comply with an agreement between the lender and the borrower, which is more commonly known as a mortgage.

The violation of a mortgage is a default in the need for a payment of a promissory note, which is secured by a lien on the property. Once the foreclosure process is done, the lender has the choice to sell the property and collect proceeds to pay off the mortgage.

There are two types of foreclosure. These include judicial sale and foreclosure by power of sale.

Judicial sale foreclosure is allowed and available in every state. This type of foreclosure involves the sale of the foreclosed property as long as  the sale is under court supervision. All money that is made during this process is sent to the property’s unpaid mortgage. Before foreclosure can take place, the residents of the foreclosed property have to be notified. However, notification issuance is usually set by state laws and rules.

The other type of foreclosure is foreclosure by sale. This type of foreclosure is also allowed by many states. This type of foreclosure deals with the sale of the property by the mortgage holder with the need of court supervision. This type is usually much faster.
