Various activities like outreach programs, community programs, fellowships, evangelizations, and many other church-related activities are often conducted. These activities keep the youth members active.

The members will be preoccupied with all the activities of the youth group especially after their classes and during weekends. With the encouragement of the parents, the youth members will actively participate in the various activities of the group. 

Other youth groups are not related to the church in any way but the youth leaders see to it that all activities start by asking guidance from the Lord. The activities of the group may vary depending on the activity coordinator. Yearly group activities are organized by the coordinator. Most groups accept activity suggestions from members. That way, new activities can be organized which can keep all the group members interested.

Through the various games, the group will become closer and they will get to know each other better.
