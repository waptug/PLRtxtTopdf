Article Body:
With last minute travel, or reisen, you'll find that prices tend to be much higher for cruises, flights, hotels, and car rentals. Fruehbucher (or the early booker) always gets the best deals, right? In many cases, yes! But now, there are some helpful online resources such as last minute or reisen sites that make it easier than ever for you to secure your travel arrangements at great prices, even at the last minute! Here are some tips for using these types of sites to save time and money.

Choose a Dependable Travel Booking Website

Look for a last minute or reisen website that offers "all-in-one" packages to the places you love to visit. A professional travel site should not only offer the best in deals, but also the best in quality. Be sure the hotels, flights (flugs), cruises (Kreuzfahrt), car rentals, and other services are not low-class services with poor quality and customer service. If possible, talk with other travelers who have used their services to find out their experience.

Features Every Last Minute or Reisen Website Should Have

The travel site should offer extensive searches and options to find the destination, pricing, and schedule you need. Some will offer last minute or reisen deals in packages that will save you money on all your major travel expenses. The site should have a charter flight section where you can choose the destination for your flight (flug), how many passengers, your departure and arrival dates, and where you can compare pricing all in one place. Many airlines have realized the benefits of offering last minute airfare deals on the Internet. Last minute or reisen sites can locate these flights for you so you won't have to spend hours on research.

Some sites will even allow you to secure a car rental for when you arrive at your destination. This is very helpful if traveling to a foreign land where you will not know how to get around. Some car rental services will bring the car to you at the airport when you arrive. 

Tip: Be sure to study the country's "rules of the road" before driving your rental car if traveling to a foreign country.

Another great feature to look for on a last minute or reisen website is hotel booking. Securing your hotel in advance can also save time and money if you use the right travel services. Some even have a hotel voucher system for even more savings. You can choose your destination and type of hotel to compare prices and quality of service. You can also find a hotel that is located in the area you wish to visit for attractions or locate a secluded luxury resort if you want a romantic getaway.

Booking Kreuzfahrt (or Cruises) Online

Whether you want to spend your entire vacation on a cruise (Kreuzfahrt) or take shorter cruise during your vacation, you can also easily book these online at a last minute or reisen website. Whether it's a cruise in the Caribbean or some other destination, ordering Kreuzfahrt packages in advance online can relieve many stresses. You'll be able to research the different types of cruises, their schedules, destinations and stops along the way, and compare service and prices - all from your own living room!

Experience New Travel Destinations

A great benefit of making your travel plans online is that travel sites usually offer packages to places around the world. You can experience new destinations you never dreamed of such as Italy, Germany, France, Spain, Austria, Egypt, India, and many other places. Find remote luxury resorts for your honeymoon that feature nature at its best. Or, tour historic places if you're a history buff. Hike the Swiss Alps or swim along the gorgeous beaches of Greece!
