When do you need data recovery help?  There are going to be those times when you just delete the wrong file or lose your data when your computer somehow loses power.  But, what about the event of hard drive failure?  What in the world can you do then to repair the lost data that you have?  There are several things that you will want to do to get that data back.  Luckily, today's computers are often powerful tools that have some helpful strategies to prevent and restore these problems.

Step 1:  Determine what has happened.  If you find that you have an error message on your screen, jot it down.  That is a clue as to what happened.  You may need to contact your provider to access help.  If your data is gone, and you can not find it in your recycle bin, keep track of what happened.

Step 2:  Try your recovery system.  Most computers today have a back up that will save what you are working on as you are working on it.  This can be helpful in providing you with the necessary help you need in finding files that are just lost. 

Step 3:  If these things are not enough to restore any of the data that you have lost, or you have had a hard drive crash, it is essential to use a good quality data recovery product or software tool to help in restoring at least some of it.  If your system does not come with this, which most do not, you will need to purchase it.  But, it can help to restore data that is far more worthwhile to you when you think that everything is gone.

Even with data recovery software and the best computer technicians, not everything can be successfully recovered.  If nothing else, you can learn from this and keep everything on your computer backed up onto a removable disk.  Consider doing this at least weekly if you use your computer for quite a bit of storage, monthly otherwise.
