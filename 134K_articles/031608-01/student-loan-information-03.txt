Venturing off to a University can be a wonderful and exciting experience. I certainly recall the day I enrolled for my first classes toward an English degree. WOW, was there ever a long line at the admissions office! But forget about all that hassle. No one has to deal with waiting in any lines for classes anymore. Everything is on the web now days. Just create an account and you'll be set throughout your college career. It takes all of a few minutes to sign up for courses. Now the bookstore on the other hand is a different deal altogether. You will commonly find lines heading clear out the door at the start of each quarter/semester. Oh but wait; we forgot one crucial aspect of college life. How are you going to afford all this? After all, a higher education is definitely not cheap by any means. Maybe what you need is some student loan information to get you started. 

Like many college students striving for their BAs and BSs, I sought out student loan information and financial aid options. Right from the start my mother told me to apply for any and all grants I could find. She said it was free money, if I recall correctly. This is the cash you will not have to pay back with interest. Then there is the student loan process. Many of us need valid student loan information to get started with college life. With dorm or apartment fees, food, tuition and books to cover, we need all the funds we can muster. So get ready to apply for some student loans. One of the major ones that most of us tend to take advantage of is the Stafford loan. You can apply for subsidized and/or unsubsidized. I always recommend subsidized first because the government pays the interest on the loan while you're still in school. You can't beat them apples. Even though it can be difficult living the student life, there are perks set in place for you if you look for them. 

Try the Internet! This is the ideal place to begin your search for student loan information. Everything you need to know is on the web. You can even pull up the fafsfa website and get started with your student loan and financial aid process right away. Find out what you qualify for and who offers the best interest rates following graduation.
