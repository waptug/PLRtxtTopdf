Yeast Infection Test

A yeast infection test is the best way to confirm whether or not you have this disease. In fact, there are many types of these you can take but the first step is to first see a doctor. 

Once you are in the clinic, the doctor will ask you some questions. These include what symptoms are you feeling, for how long have you experienced it and what medications are you currently taking. You have to be honest about everything especially if this has happened before. If this is the first time, then that is good if you have had previous history, then there is a good chance it will happen again. 

But perhaps the most basic test will be for the doctor to take a sample and then wait for the results to come out. There are two kinds. The first is called the vaginal culture which is usually taken during a wet mount test. If you happen to have more than the usual amount of yeast down there then you have yeast infection. The doctor may also do a blood test because yeast infections are sometimes caused by diabetes or another health related problem. 

Some doctors also conduct a pelvic examination because an inflammation of the skin of the vulva which is within the vagina and on the cervix. What the doctor is looking for here is if it is dry or if there are white plaques on the vaginal wall. 

If the tests have confirmed that you have yeast infection, it is time for the doctor to figure out the type of treatment to be administered.

So what happens then? If this has happened for the first time, your doctor can prescribe something to make it go away after 7 days. If however this has happened again, you can try to use tablets, creams or suppositories depending on the recommendation of your physician.

Studies show that having  a yeast infection makes you more susceptible to contracting HIV as vaginal irritation may allow the easier package of this fatal virus into the bloodstream. Although this does not happen often, women who experience it and are resistant to treatment should already be checked for other causes because the doctor has already ruled out the overuse of antibiotics which happens to be one of the causes of this disease. 

Some people have used some items at home to get rid of yeast infections. Some examples of these include cranberry juice, vinegar, yogurt, curds, olive leaf and grape fruit extract, potassium sorbate, acidophilus as well as a water solution. 

The entire time that you are being treated for yeast infection, make sure that you do not engage in any sexual contact because you could also infect your sexual partner with this problem. You can still spread the disease even if your partner is wearing a condom and you applied cream already because the oil based creams damage it as this is only made from latex. 

The yeast infection test is the best way for doctors to tell if you have this problem or not even if you already show these symptoms. You might think that this is unnecessary and a waste of time but your doctors has to follow certain procedures so they will be able to recommend the right treatment for your condition.
