This is the original recipe for making paczki that was brought from Europe by my wife’s grandmother when she first arrived at Ellis Island and the onward to Pennsylvania where she finally settled. 
Just how old this recipe really is I have no idea but the only thing I know is how good the paczki’s are. 

You must follow this recipe exactly or it will not work well, I know, I have tried to create some shortcuts that were ok but not as good. 

This recipe yields 4dozen of the most delicious punczki that you ever had. 

Remember all ingredients should be room temperature. 

1.Disolve:
¾ ounce yeast in ¼ cup warm water
warm ½ quart milk
add to the yeast and warm milk 3 cups flour and let rise for about ½ hour to create what is called a sponge.


2.Put together:


½ quart warm milk
¼ lb. Butter
2 tablespoons shortening
½ cup sugar
2 tablespoons whiskey


3.Mix steps 1 and 2 with 6 eggs, pinch of salt, 9 cups flour and mix until you get a really good textured dough.


Let the dough rise until double in size, cut the dough into 2 ounce pieces and form balls. 

Place the dough balls on a well oiled flat pan, let them rise for about ½ hour to about ¾ hour. 

Fry dough balls in 350 degree oil until well browned on both sides then put them on a brown paper bag to drain the oil form frying. 

Let cool for a while and fill using a pastry bag with a tip that has a whole about the size of a pencil, roll in sugar or 10x sugar and enjoy with a hot cup of coffee. 

You can fill them with prune leckvar or any jellies that you like.
