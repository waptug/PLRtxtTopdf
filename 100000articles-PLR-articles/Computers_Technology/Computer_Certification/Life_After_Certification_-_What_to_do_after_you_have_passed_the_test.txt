Okay you have now passed your certification test, congratulations! Now what? How is this going to actually improve your life, your career? Have you thought about your plans after you have passed the test? For many taking a certification exam is only a stepping stone to true success.

The first thing I would do even before pursuing a certification is to have a plan on how this is actually going to help you in your career. Just because you have passed the test does not mean you are an expert. You must first prove it to the rest of the world. How do you do this? 

Sit down at your computer or desk and write out your career goals for the next year, five years, ten years and your entire working career. How does this certification fit into those goals? Can you use it to establish more credibility as an expert?

The first step I would take is to start writing tutorials on the subject matter that you claim to be an expert in. Post these tutorials to your own website, blog or eZine distribution websites. the more you write about a subject the more likely a person is going to consider yourself an expert in the field and the certification just backs that up as well. The more visibility you receive the more likely you are to get clients that are willing to pay for your services.

The second step I would take is not to stop studying! The best thing for you to do is learn as much as possible about your subject matter and to stay on top of it. Each time you learn something new write about it. This not only helps you stay visible but shows that you are up to date with the latest technology. If you are studying for another certification or an upgrade to your existing one learn all you can about the material and then start writing tutorials that teaches others on the same subject. Not only will this help reinforce what you have already learned but it could lead to increased job offers and other opportunities.

The third step would be to visit as many newsgroups as possible to put your knowledge to the test. By helping others this way you reinforce what you have learned and again gain valuable exposure in the field.

Lastly I would find a local user group in your area and start volunteering for it. This will greatly increase the number of contacts you can network with and make your name known in the community. Do not have a user group in your area? See if you can start one and start speaking about your area of expertise to a local crowd. Later I would connect with other regional user groups to see if they are looking for speakers and then start speaking at these user groups.

For many the certification test is the place where most people stop in their careers and then complain that this test did not really help them. The test is merely a stepping stone in establishing more credibility. The rest is up to the individual. You reap what you sow. Certification only contains some of the seeds that you need to plant in order to become truly successful.
