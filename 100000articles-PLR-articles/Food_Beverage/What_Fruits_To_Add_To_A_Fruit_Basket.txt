If you want to give a unique gift that is guarantee to be used an enjoyed by the recipient, consider a fruit basket. Fruit baskets are fabulous ways to provide your friend, family member, neighbor, co-worker, or client with a delicious—and healthy—treat that looks like a million bucks, but is actually budget friendly. When looking a fruit basket, you can either choose to purchase one pre-made or make your own to save you some of your hard-earned cash. Regardless where you get your fruit basket, carefully consider the contents and personalize the gift to the recipient.

The most important thing about a fruit basket is indeed the fruit itself. When looking for what fruits to add to a fruit basket, consider these popular options:

• Apples: This hearty fruit is a fruit basket favorite. Most everyone loves an apple, so you do not have to worry about less adventurous tastes avoiding the goodies. Also, apples tend to travel or ship well and have a long shelf life, so you do not have to worry about the fruit in your basket arriving spoiled or crushed.

• Pears: Like apples, pears are another fruit basket favorite. However, due to the more delicate nature of the pear, they may need a bit more protection—especially if the basket is to be shipped. Most pears are purchased in some protective covering, usually either a plastic container or foam wrapping, so consider leaving this protection in place when assembling your fruit basket.

• Citrus: Oranges, grapefruits, nectarines, tangerines, and clementines are perennial favorites in a fruit basket. In addition to adding a fantastic color, these sweet treats are favored by most individuals. However, keep in mind that some citrus, mainly oranges and grapefruits, are large in size and heavy in weight. If you plan on adding many of these juicy delights, ensure your basket is of the appropriate size to handle the fruit.

• Pineapples: Usually, the thought of fruit baskets and pineapples go hand in hand, as these elaborate fruits add a tremendous punch to the baskets appearance. Before you throw in a pineapple “just because,” consider also purchasing a pineapple cutting, a small, inexpensive device that will allow your guest to enjoy the delicious meat of the fruit.

• Grapes and Berries: More delicate fruit, including grapes and berries, should be added judiciously. Since these fruits generally do not ship well, you should reconsider adding these fruits to baskets going great distances. In addition to their fragility, these fruits do not have a long shelf life, meaning they can potentially be spoiled upon arrival of the gift.

• Unique Fruits: Depending on the type of basket you are assembling, you may decide to include unique fruits. Usually tropical in nature, consider adding kiwi, star fruit, plantains, and even coconuts if the recipient will enjoy this more unusual fare.
