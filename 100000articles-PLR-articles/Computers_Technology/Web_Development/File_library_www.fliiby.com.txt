 "olaa..:) is what we love to say here at Fliiby. Fliiby stands for File Library : an unique, unified and simple way for file uploading, categorizing and sharing.
enjoy..."


So that's what i can say for now .. i like there design its simple and basically its all in flash ... Player can be moved with arrows for few seconds forward and back and can be stooped with space witch i liked the most as you tube doesn't have that. Multi upload option is nice and categorising all of the files .. hm i hope it will all work out nice .. any way enjoy if u like this new type of site ...
