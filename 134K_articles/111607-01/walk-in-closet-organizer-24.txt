I have only been lucky enough to have a walk in closet once in my life, but when I get my own house I will insist that I have one. I am tried of not having enough closet space in my life, and even more tired of not having enough room for my clothes. I will have one of these closets, and I will have it built if I must. One other thing I will insist upon is that there is a walk in closet organizer in there to help keep things in order. If I don’t have one of these things, I know that space will quickly become a mess.

I have a lot of shoes, and I know the chances of keeping them all neat and lined up against the wall are low. I just don’t have the patience for it. If I have some sort of walk in closet organizer that can help me with my shoes, things are going to be a lot neater for me. I will also want the usual things, like places to hang shirts and also storage spaces for those things that I do not want to hang up.
