Article Body:
Patpong is renowned for its go-go bars, discos and late night "constellations." Despite it's somewhat unsavory reputation, it's remarkably safe to visit - though it's as well to stick to the downstairs bars, as some of the upper floor establishments have been known to overcharge. Soi Patpong 1 has a few go go bars but is mainly a shopping street where foreign couples shop and drink. Soi Patpong 2 has numerous smaller beer bars (ba bia in Thai), as well as a row of karaoke establishments and the most popular restaurants on the strip. Soi Patpong 3, an unassuming dead-end lane, is more of a gay venue. The strip comes alive in the early evening, but with the exception of a handful of constellations is more-or-less closed down by 1am. Although sex is for sale in Patpong, the area is much more than just a red light area, being frequented by young Thais and foreign visitors who dance, talk and dine into the small hours.
