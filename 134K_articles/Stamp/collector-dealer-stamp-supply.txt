Getting Stamps from a Reputable Supplier 

The internet has changed how people send mail. Until such time that technology finds a way to transport packages in the same manner, stamps will still be used to get documents and parcels from one destination to another. 

Stamps are not just used for packages when it goes through the post office. People also collect it for the artwork and detail on each which has historical value.  

This is the reason that a lot have made this into a hobby even if there is not that much money that can be made.  

Since the collector cannot always rely on mails being sent to the home and people don’t trade it often, it is best to find someone who will supply the hobbyist with it to expand the collection. 

This supplier is someone who collects stamps and sells it off to other people at the same time. This individual should be knowledgeable about the subject since other people know what to look for when conducting business. 

A lot of these individuals can be found in the classified ads of the newspaper. These people always have sufficient stock and are willing to trade with those who have appreciation for stamps.    

There are also websites in the internet that act as a supplier to the hobbyist. Some of these only deal with local stamps that have been around since the 19th century. Others offer both local and foreign that also dates back to the same period.

The supplier also has a price catalogue that is carried at all times. This is the basis where the person will decide how much to sell it to the hobbyist. Since this can easily be bought at the local specialty store, the stamps have standard value in the market. 

In terms of taking care of stamps, these people are no different than the hobbyists. The suppliers have to make sure that these are handled carefully. Dirt, oil or any elements must not damage the inventory since this will make it difficult to sell at a good price. 

The suppliers also handle the stamps with care which includes the use of tongs in giving the stamps to its new owner. The magnifying glass is also another tool these suppliers use to make sure that these were given in good condition and no one can complain after the transaction has taken place.  

Suppliers store these surplus stamps in room temperature storage areas. When the times comes that a deal will be made, this is the only time it is brought out for the prospective client to look at.

There are two ways that transactions happen. The first meeting the supplier at the desired meeting place. This person will be carrying a few binders that the hobbyist can look at then arrangements will be made for the deal to push through.

The second is meeting the supplier in the office. This is because that person can only carry a number of binders during a sales meeting. It will be good idea for the hobbyist to visit the office to see other designs that are worth adding to the collection. 

Suppliers also get some stamps from the post office since these are sold in rolls. These people get it at a discount for ordering in bulk then profiting from it when the hobbyist orders a page or two. 

These people also frequent auctions and exhibits. Since this is like a business, the steady flow of customers will ensure the success of being a supplier to the hobbyists. 

There are many stamp clubs around and asking fellow members how to get in touch with the supplier will help a lot in making the collection bigger. 

By using everything to get hold of the supplier, the person can be sure that the stamps are of good quality. This is a win-win situation since everybody gets something out of it. 

Stamps are easier to obtain now compared to how it was years ago. This is because the circulation of these items is more commonplace.  By finding someone who can be trusted to get it from, it will not be difficult for the hobbyist to expand the collection that already exists at home.
