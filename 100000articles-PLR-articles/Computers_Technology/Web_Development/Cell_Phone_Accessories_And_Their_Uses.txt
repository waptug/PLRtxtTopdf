The number of brands of cell phones available in the market available today is growing rapidly. These models are available in different colors, shapes and sizes. With increase in use of cell phones, people have become interested in making use of all the features in a cell phone. To make use of these features, they need what you call the accessories. Accessories have three main functions to serve – 1) To improve the functioning of the cell phone, 2) To improve its appearance, and 3) To increase the safety of the cell phone and also its user.

Since the use of cell phones has become cheap and economical in the recent days, people have been trying to eliminate the use of normal phones all together. Now a person can easily acquire a cell phone at any cost, ranging from high end to low end phones. The accessories associated with these phones have also become cheap. With the addition of accessories, the people have been able to use their cell phones as multipurpose devices to accomplish a plethora of functions.

There are a number of cell phone accessories available like antennas, batteries, cases, faceplates, holsters, holders, hands free kits and some others. You should not jump into buying an accessory just because it looks nice or since it can increase the applications that your cell phone can be used for. Firstly, you must access your needs and determine exactly what type of accessories you require for your cell phone. Though many people feel that cell phone accessories are only fashion gadgets, the truth is that most of them are beneficial to the user in one way or the other.

Hands-free kit is the most important accessory when it comes to increasing the safety of the user. Since law has been enacted prohibiting drivers from talking on cell phones while driving, they can now talk without talking their hands off the steering wheel. These kits also enable you to wear headphone and microphone which makes it easy for talking on them.

Another good accessory is the antenna. Antennas help to improve the signal reception qualities. Hence, you will be able to receive your cell phone signal even if you are trekking in the mountains or are present in a lift. Hence, this accessory improves the capabilities of the cell phone.

The need for other accessories like cases, faceplates, holsters and holders must be assessed on your requirements.
