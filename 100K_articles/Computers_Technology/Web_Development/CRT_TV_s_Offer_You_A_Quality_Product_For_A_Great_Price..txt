There are plenty of different TV’s on the market these days for you to purchase. However, the technology that is behind them is expensive and that means you can expect to pay a hefty price for many of the models that are on the market. It is possible though to find a TV that offers you quality and that fits your budget. You won’t be able to get the top of the line but you will be able to find a decent TV.

CRT is the oldest technology when it comes to TV models on the market right now. This means you can get them for a very low price. In fact, you will find you can buy a very large size of screen in the CRT models for the same price or less than a small size of screen in the LCD or plasma category.

If you have your heart set on a plasma or LCD model, you should still take a look at the selection of CRT’s out there. You can get a couple of them to put in other areas of your home such as the kitchen or bedroom. You can also place them in your child’s bedroom and if they get ruined you didn’t invest too much in them. Those high priced plasmas and LCD’s aren’t always as good as the hype so think hard before you buy one.

If you are on a tight budget then a CRT is the only way to go. There are plenty of good models to select from and you will be happy with it. You can eventually upgrade to a plasma or LCD when you have more funds available or when the prices drop. As they offer new products the older models will become more affordable. They will also work out the various technical issues that have risen so you can buy a quality TV that works well.

The amount of TV you watch as well as what you watch will determine what type of TV you purchase. For those who only watch TV for an hour or two each day it isn’t worth it to invest in something expensive. However, if you enjoy watching concerts or sports events on TV then you will want to get the best possible quality for your entertainment.
