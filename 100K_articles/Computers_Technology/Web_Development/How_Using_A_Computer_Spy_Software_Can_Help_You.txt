If you have ever heard of a keylogger or computer monitoring, then you have heard of computer spy software. These are typically used to keep an eye on your teenagers, employees, or spouse’s computer use. These work well in catching things that should not be going on while they are on the computer.

What happens is that the computer spy software will make a record of all activities on the computer, without trapping or tracking. No one will even know the software exists, because it runs in the background unnoticed. Everything is recorded from chat conversations to keystrokes, and even stored data, viewed files, and websites the user has visited.

You have your choice from thousands of programs available when it comes to computer spy software. Some work really well, such as the one from the Spy Shop, and others are nothing more than hype, ready to take advantage of your computer access. In most cases, anti-virus, spy, or spam software such as Norton or MacAfee will not detect the program, thanks to proper coding; therefore, the user will never know the program exists.

If you suspect your employees of playing games, visiting unwanted websites, or talking with the competition, a computer spy software program might be just what you need as evidence. The same goes for cheating spouses. Many times, as this has become evident throughout the internet existence, thanks to dating sites and pornography, spouses turn to the internet. What may start out as innocent chatting, often becomes so much more, which could even result in real life meetings.

A good computer spy program will detect this and will provide you with the proof you need to confront the problem. Teenagers are notorious for doing exactly what their parents tell them not to do, chatting with strangers, visiting questionable websites, revealing their personal information, all things we have taught them not to do. With a computer spy program, you can keep track of what your teen is doing, obviously in efforts to protect them from internet predators.
