Article Body:
As a self-proclaimed skeptic looking for a REAL way to make honest $ on the internet, it took a long time to find something I felt was worth investigating. I have checked out many sites, trying to compare potential with time and $ required to make them work. All I wanted was something where within a few days I saw results and the more I put in, the more I got out. 

There is money to be made on the internet if you know how, the problem is finding a proven way that anyone can follow. Most of the sites I checked out claimed to teach you how, but charge large amounts and deliver only vague information that did not help me. Finally found a system that delivered real results for me.

When I found Mark Warren’s Ultimate Wealth Package, I started out trying to poke holes in the system to prove it did not work, but could not find any holes in it. Even found several independent research sites that had compared his system to many others, basically confirming my findings. 

The most recent research site found (www.brlent.com) compares 3 systems proven to work, listing unbiased strengths and weaknesses of each. I encourage you to look at this comparison if you are considering the Internet as an income source.
