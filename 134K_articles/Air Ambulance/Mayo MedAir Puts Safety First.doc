}Mayo MedAir Puts Safety First\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The Mayo 
Clinic is well known for their top-notch medical standards and quality.  People 
from all over the world enlist the services of the Mayo Clinic when medical situations
 arise that need specialized care.  Like the Mayo Clinic, Mayo MedAir puts the patient
 and safety first.  Any patient that requires air ambulance transport will be properly
 monitored, comfortable, and safe during the flight.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Mayo MedAir
 is a member of the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Services.  
Although no federal standards exist in the industry, air ambulance companies certified
 by the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Services are known to meet
 or exceed minimum standards.  Such standards include competency and safety requirements
.  Standards in education, administration, communication, and maintenance are also
 considered.  Mayo MedAir is the only CAMTS certified air ambulance company in the
 state of Minnesota, and one of few companies around the globe to make this level
 of commitment.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Mayo MedAir
 flights are known for their safety record.  Each air ambulance has two pilots on
 board.  The pilots are required to have numerous hours of experienced flight time
.  Several hours of flight time in high-traffic areas are a requirement for Mayo
 MedAir pilots.  Unlike some other air ambulance companies, Mayo MedAir does not
 send out a single pilot on a medical mission.  The pilots at Mayo MedAir are dedicated
 to medical missions.  They are not pulled away from other positions to man a flight
 in an emergency.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The medical
 staff that accompanies the patient are a team of no fewer than two members.  Each
 medical team is highly trained to tackle any condition the patient may have or 
an emergency that arises during transport.  In specialized cases, the Mayo MedAir
 medical team may consist of more members that can directly deal with the specific
 medical needs of the patient.  This fact is especially important in cases involving
 the need for NICU services or a respiratory therapist, for instance.  Each member
 of the team works at the Mayo Clinic and is specially trained for critical care
.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The medical
 team has a medical director above them that oversees their work.  This position
 is filled by a Mayo Clinic physician trained in emergency care.  The medical director
 is responsible for the actions of the medical team during the flight and transport
, so the quality standards and safety record remains high.  The care of the patient
 becomes top priority.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Safety of
 the patient is of utmost importance to Mayo MedAir.  For this reason, each air 
ambulance carries standard equipment that allows the patient to receive proper treatment
 during transit.  In addition to specialized medical tools and equipment, the air
 ambulance has the technology to stay in contact with physicians on the ground during
 the entire flight.  Whether communication is via phone, email, or text message, 
the medical team and hospital are aware of all circumstances during transit.  \par

 to see that Mayo MedAir is committed to patient safety.  This air ambulance service
 is dedicated to quality service.  Every aspect of safety and patient care has been
 considered.   \par}
