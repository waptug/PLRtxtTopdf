Delete Search History

As a writer, I do a lot of research, and a lot of it is on the Internet. Though I use Google a lot, I do tend to check different search engines because sometimes they all give me different information. Once in a while I have to delete search history because the drop down menu can be so long it actually staggers my computer. I can do this through my preferences on Google, but I have not found a way to do it on any of the other sites.

Though my reason to delete search history is a matter of overflow from what I do for a living, many people have other reasons for doing so, and many of them are less than honest. If you are searching for something you don’t want your spouse to see, you will have to delete search history incase they come across it while doing a search of their own. Children may also do this if they are searching for something they don’t want their parents to know they were looking for.

If you find that you aren’t sure if you are doing the right or wrong thing, just consider if you want to delete search history or not. If you are doing something that you know your spouse or parents would flip out about, you should stop and consider why you are doing it. You can delete search history if you want to, but you should know that there are many other ways someone can find out what you have been doing online, and you are bound to get caught anyway.

On the other hand, besides researching like I do, there are other things that are perfectly good to hide. If you are going to delete search history because you are looking for a special surprise for your spouse for a holiday or other occasion, you certainly don’t want to spoil the surprise by leaving the history there for someone to see. At the same time, if you have a friend in trouble, and it really is your friend and not you, and you need information, you may not want to alarm your parents. In this case, you may want to delete search history so they don’t think it is you. Just remember though, no matter what or who it is, if you are looking for answers, your parents will need to know. They may be more helpful than you could have ever imagined.
