Time Tracking, Billing and Other Issues

Time tracking, billing, invoicing and dealing with credit and collections are big issues in IT consulting.  A lot of people wonder which software they should use for time tracking and billing.  If you’re just focusing on that, you’re probably missing the bigger point here.  

It’s a heck of a lot more important than the software you use. Of course you should use a piece of software that makes it a little easier to do your IT consulting job, but the software is not going to fix the underlying problems.
