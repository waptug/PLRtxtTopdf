Anyone can sign up for MySpace, literally, anyone. Well, you do have to be a certain age limit, but essentially you need to be old enough to know how to type and how to read and form a coherent thought. And this is why MySpace has exploded into a fifty million user database of people that are looking to network with you. The excellent thing about MySpace is that it really is what it says it is, it is MySpace to each and every person that signs up. If you take a minute to look around at other people’s pages, you will see a wealth of MySpace Graphics, pages, and layouts that each uniquely identify their authors as individuals. And you can do it too.

The industry of MySpace graphics has become so huge, that there is literally an infinite amount of graphics at your fingertips. Type in what you want, and you can find it. The best thing about these graphics is that almost always they are free. Free you say? Yes, you can not only get a MySpace account for free, but you can add your own unique signatures and MySpace graphics at no cost.

The first way most people personalize their MySpace is through a customized layout, any of which you can find anywhere on the web. This layout will speak to the world about who you are and what you want out of life. You can then add a series of MySpace graphics and pictures that will add those little personal details that reveal the things about you that you want people to know.

Graphic headers and glitter texts are igniting MySpace graphics with a firestorm. On most sites, you just need to enter the text that you want in glitter format, punch in a few buttons, and BAM. You’ve got yourself some glitter! Adding a little bling like this to your MySpace graphics only takes a few minutes. And you certainly do NOT need to be a computer whiz to do it. Having trouble? Most sites will even offer you free step-by-step user friendly tutorials to incorporate the glitter into your MySpace. How easy is THAT?

When you are editing your profile on MySpace, you simply need to copy and paste the codes you get from the sites you have chosen to get customized MySpace graphics come. This is very easy as these sites will develop the code for you, and you just have to paste it where you want it on your MySpace profile. Use those Preview buttons and away you go.
