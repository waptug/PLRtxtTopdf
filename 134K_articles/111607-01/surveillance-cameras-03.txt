Many people fail to realize the importance of securing their home. While you may assume your subdivision is "safe" and that your home in particular could never be the target of a burglary, armed robbery or home invasion, you're sadly mistaken. In reality this can happen to anyone, rich, middle class or poor. Therefore your best defense is to plan ahead. Take necessary precautions before anything bad has occurred. This means quality door locks, flood lights and surveillance cameras to name a few of the basics. The better you secure your home, the better off you'll be. 

Generally when folks think about surveillance cameras, they picture businesses and banks. While these are common places that can be targeted by criminals, your home is not so different. Which would you rather rob; a well-secured bank with countless surveillance cameras and armed guards or a middle class home in the suburbs while everyone is away at work and school? I think the latter sounds like a much safer bet. So, your goal should be to deter criminals from choosing your home. This is where advanced door locks, window alarms and surveillance cameras come into play. Every door that leads into your home should have a well-secured deadbolt that requires a key on both sides. This makes it much more difficult for criminals to penetrate. Simple window alarms will only cost you around 20 bucks, but scream accordingly if someone attempts to open a window in your home. Outdoor flood lights are ideal for catching potential crooks and intruders. If they enter your yard or driveway, the motion detector sets off the bright lights, illuminating your entire lot. This will not only assist you when arriving home at night, but it is sure to deter criminals from approaching your house after dark. Oh, and what about those handy surveillance cameras? These are a wonderful security addition to any home. Not only will they keep an eye out for you at night, but they also guard your home during the day. You can even wire them to a laptop and spy on your house while at work. This keeps you on top of the situation at all times.
