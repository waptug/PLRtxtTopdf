These vehicles were actually built in Kalmar in Sweden. The very first Volvo 960 was actually completed and came out to the streets on the 12th of August in 1991. It was then packaged as a 1992 year model. Starting from 1995 up until a year before its last production, the Volvo 960s were built in another location. This time, it was in Goteborg, Sweden. It was in June 27th of 1994 that the very first one from this location came out to do some rolling on the streets. 

In the United States, the Volvo 960 parts were equipped with an electronically controlled Asin Warner automatic gearbox. As per those that were marketed in Europe, these came with 2.5 liter engines combined with a manual gearbox that was called as the M90. These vehicles were actually a range of rear wheel drive cars.

As for the Volvo 960s marketed in the United States, these actually got their power from an all new in line 6 cylinder block with double overhead camshafts. The engine was a DOHC unit. Each of the cylinders had four valves. It was an advanced engine during that time.
