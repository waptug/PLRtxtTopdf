These both sites are legitimate sites with them you can make money at home with your own home based internet business by work at home with Google Adsense program or data entry jobs

If you need a legitimate work at home site you can choose into them to join .  A better way to decide which online survey companies you wish to participate in is to do a little legwork yourself.  

Jobslover.com & Adsenselover.com are open to anyone in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and almost all part in the world, who is at least 18 years old.  They promise a free membership and access to 30 different companies that will pay you cash and "prizes" for participating in online surveys right from your home.


One of the good things about this site is the offer to do "data work from home."  Anyone can make money by online data entry home with these sites.  

There are approximately over 500 internet sites that offer people "cash" for participating in surveys from home.  Many of them are scams but jobslover and adsenselover are the real one as I tested them and making money with them.  You can usually tell these sites by their disclaimer that you will not "get rich" off of them and they normally tell you up front about what you can expect to earn and how you will receive your earnings.

Other sites simply exist to get your information so they can sell it to telemarketers.  If you are taking a survey and frequently directed to different websites where you are asked about receiving a quote for health insurance, do yourself a favor and click out immediately.  In the month that I've been participating in online surveys, I have received (and I'm not exaggerating here) at least 10 calls from people who want to sell me health insurance.  One afternoon I received two calls, fifteen minutes apart, from the same company.  Unless you are really desperate to talk to people on the phone or get e-mail from strangers promising you riches, stay away from these type of sites.

Jobslover.com & Adsenselover.com  both are legitimate sites. You can make money online by participating in different paid survey or online data entry jobs or if you want to make money with Google Adsense Program you can start your own home based business at home with adsense and make money at home automatically day and night.   If you are looking for a way to make money online, do so at a legitimate site.  Check out the website, read as much of the information carefully before signing up and beware of any site that promises that you will get rich overnight.  You will not make a living doing surveys at home.  This is merely a way to supplement your income and buy a few extras.  There are plenty of legitimate sites out there.  Jobslover.com and Adsenselover.com are one of them.
