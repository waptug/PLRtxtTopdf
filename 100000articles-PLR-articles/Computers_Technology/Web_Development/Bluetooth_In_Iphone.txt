Following its immensely successful Apple iPods, Apple has now come up with yet another hot selling product which is the iPhone that has all of the functionality of cell phones as also an iPod wide screen having touch controls and best of all an Internet enabled device that makes communicating with the outside world a real breeze. One of the more endearing features that you will appreciate in these new iPhones is the iPhone Bluetooth which allows users to talk without the need of wired headsets and which comes with a number of handy features as well.

The iPhone Bluetooth headset has just one button that allows users to receive their phone calls with simple intuition as well. Furthermore, you can get as much as 5.5 hours of talking time with as many as seventy-two hours standby time and this is made possible by its batteries that are made from lithium-ion and which are not only rechargeable but also in-built as well.

Now that the iPhone Bluetooth on Apple has begun to slowly become available it is good to know that it is no more than a minimalist accessory though it still has some very useful features as well, especially when the headset is connected to the dock that is dual charging and you are able to also see the headset charge along with the iPhone’s own charge to let you know when the iPhone Bluetooth is ready for use. And, for an additional twenty-nine dollars you can also get the iPhone Bluetooth Travel cable and also a set of replacement stereo headphones.

In any case, one cannot help but like the iPhone Bluetooth which is also light and simple while the design is very attractive though some would consider it a bit over priced and also not living up to its true potential, and this is something that may not go down to well because after paying one hundred twenty-nine dollars for your iPhone Bluetooth, you would expect that it gives nothing less than high-end performance.

However, you can still take two calls by pushing a button in order to hold an existing call while taking the second call and then all you need to do is push as well as hold the button till it emits a beep to let you know the existing call is over after which you can revert back to the call on hold. And, pairing the Bluetooth with your iPhone is not a real problem given that it has been designed to pair well with your iPhone.
