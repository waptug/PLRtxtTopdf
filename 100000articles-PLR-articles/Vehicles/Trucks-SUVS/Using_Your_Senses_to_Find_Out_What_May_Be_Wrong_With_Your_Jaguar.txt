Keeping your Jaguar or any kind of vehicle for that matter, in top notch shape and performance is something that you would have to do yourself. After all, keeping a vehicle also means being responsible enough to do the right amount of maintenance as well as being responsible enough to keep the vehicle out of any accidents. Of course, a vehicle that is not well cared for would also mean that you would be spending a whole lot more than your budget could allow for when your car breaks down and you could not repair it yourself, off you go to the nearest mechanic. 

Experts in the field of automobiles and vehicle maintenance say that there are some simple things that vehicle owners should do. The most basic of these is to just simply listen, look, and feel. 

Listening simply means that you have to be familiar with how your vehicle sounds. However, if one day you simply notice that your vehicle has an unfamiliar sound about it, be sure to note it down and look for it again. If you notice that it becomes a continuous sound, it would be best then to bring your vehicle to the service center to see what could be wrong. 

Look is just like listening. However, this time around, you would have to use your eyes to check if there is something wrong with how your vehicle looks. Maybe your car is spewing out steam or maybe there is some kind of smoke escaping from your car’s engine which has not happened previously. Again, note it down and if it continues, don’t hesitate to consult for professional help. 

Feeling is knowing and being familiar with how your car feels when you drive it. Does it respond to you with a sharp precision? Or does it seem to hesitate each time you use new controls? That way, you could actually explain to your car attendant and mechanic what you feel whenever you drive the car. That way, these symptoms could actually assist them in finding out and fixing what might be wrong with your car.
