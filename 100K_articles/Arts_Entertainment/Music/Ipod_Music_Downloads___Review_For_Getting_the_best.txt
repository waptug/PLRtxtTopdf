Getting good places and sites for ipod music downloads is not always easy. Many sites just don't have the selection of music that would fulfill your needs. People have been downloading music to their Ipods for years and the number of sites for ipod music downloads keeps on growing.

If you have been searching for ipod music downloads and ways to get them there are many choices. With Ipod music downloads, there are more ways you can enjoy your ipod. You can listen to songs, watch movies, download pictures, play pod casts, and much more. Downloading music can bring hours of enjoyment and fun while traveling, relaxing or even while waiting for an appointment at the doctors office. 

Some sites charge up to two dollars or more per ipod music download. This can get quite expensive. I recommend you find a site that offers a one-time membership fee. These sites usually have unlimited downloads for life with a premium membership. This is almost like getting free ipod music. There are many sites out there to choose from. I have placed a banner and a link at the top of my site for the top rated site for ipod music downloads.

Most ipods come with a 2.5-inch screen for you to view. This works great using a small head set for sound. It is not bulky and you can watch your movie or music video from just about anywhere. Most sites will even offer your favorite TV programs from the major networks. 

One of the coolest things that the ipod videos downloads can bring you is the option to download music videos. Now you can listen to your favorite music and watch the music video at the same time. The site at the top of my site offers over 100 million ipod movies, music videos, as well as music downloads. This gives you a lot to choose from. 

The ipod site most recommended, is one were you can do all of your downloading for music, music videos, and ipod movie downloads. Their database has over 100 million movies songs and music videos to download and choose from. You can store the downloads on your pc and save them. Then I would recommend you upload different selections to your ipod as needed. Give yourself a change of pace from time to time. 

Once your ipod music, movies, and music videos are downloaded to your pc, you can make DVD's and CD's or watch them from your computer or TV. You'll need software and hardware to do this. In order to create your DVD, you'll need to have a DVD burner on your pc. To watch either videos or play music you can choose from many different players on your pc. I recommend either windows media player or real player. They both work quite well. 

This will give you the advantage to preview the ipod music and movies before you download them to your ipod. With over 100 million videos and songs to choose from you can have them with you now on your laptop and ipod. The ipod is an easy way to quickly watch and listen without all of the bulk of a laptop. If you haven't found a quality site, I highly recommend the unlimited ipod movie downloads site link at the top of my website.

When you find a good site like the one I have reviewed you can have all the ipod music downloads at your finger tips for years to come with out spending money over and over again.
