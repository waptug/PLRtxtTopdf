Article Body:
Private investigation has a lot of imagery and clichés attached to it. There is the "lone wolf" investigator who, for one reason or the other is unattached to the government. There is the trusty sidekick/chronicler who manages to either accidentally make discoveries which are crucial to the case or get himself into a situation where he needs rescuing. There is also the scene where the hapless client (often a beautiful blonde) goes to the office of the private investigator to seek his help. However, this last scene is slowly becoming obsolete simply because of the advent of online private investigation

Online private investigation can be defined in two ways. It could be the usage of the internet to contact private investigation agencies. It could also be the actual investigation of internet crimes through private agencies.

Let us discuss the first definition. Private Investigation agencies need clients in order to keep the business rolling. This means that they have to advertise. The internet is the best media to advertise in today. This is because it also allows people to contact a private investigation agency directly.

People who contact private investigation agencies often need discretion. Because of the advent of online private investigation a client doesn't even need to show his or her face to anyone in order to present a case. Online private investigation services will only ask the required information and the method of payment. After that, you only need to wait for the results of your inquiry.

Another thing that people need is convenience. In the past, private investigation agencies were often located in "seedy" parts of a city where rent is cheap. This means that people needed to go to great lengths in order to even present their case to a private investigator. However, online private investigation services now allow people to access the services of a private investigator right from their homes. In fact, because of the development of mobile technology, people today have access to the services of online private investigation from practically anywhere in the world.

Let us now talk about the other form of online private investigation. As we all know the internet is open to all types of people. There are those who make use of the internet to make their lives a little easier and there are those who use the internet to make others' lives harder. Because of this, many people call on the services of experts to make sure that their internet lives aren't interrupted or in any way vandalized by hackers.

There are also certain crimes which are done through the internet. Some, like embezzling and stealing electronic funds need experts in order to solve them. Online private investigation involves the investigation of various electronic records in order to crack a case.

There are experts in the field who specialize in internet security. There are also those online private investigation agencies which specialize in tracking hackers. These online private investigation agencies actually have the expertise and the training required to break through the defenses of hackers. This is because of the fact that most online private investigators used to be hackers themselves. 

Online private investigation is just one way of showing how much technology has changed our lives. Online private investigation shows both the good and the bad sides of progress. On one hand, we have easier access to people who might help us with our problems. On the other hand, we create whole new areas where we are vulnerable to attacks.
