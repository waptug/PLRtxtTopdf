Computes and Internet are the key to the Information world we live in. People talk less and chat more on the Internet. Online games are becoming more popular than anybody could ever imagine. Chat rooms are always crowded and emails are the preferred method of sending messages. Messengers are becoming the preferred method of talking across the globe. The earth has gone flat no doubt.

Computers, programming, searches, Internet, downloads, blogging, websites, all these words are becoming so common that no body can imagine that it all started not many years back. Today across all the ages, this is equally popular. Latest innovations are appearing everyday and companies are minting money online. All this was never predicted but this has become a reality.

When so much information was not available to us, we could live, isn’t it? Then why do we search for any and everything online? Does that make our life better?
