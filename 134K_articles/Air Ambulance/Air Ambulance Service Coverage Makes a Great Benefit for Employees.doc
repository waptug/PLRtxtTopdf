\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Big business
 today knows the value of a good employee.  Good employees are getting harder and
 harder to find these days.  Excellent workers are not only interested in great 
pay, but also in a fabulous benefits package.  If you are looking for another terrific
 perk to add to the company\u8217\'92s benefits package, it may be time to consider
 air ambulance service coverage.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Companies
 can receive excellent discounts on air ambulance service coverage costs for groups
 of employees.  The cost can be covered exclusively by the employer, or paid partially
 by the employer and shared with the employee.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Air ambulance
 service coverage plans are not only affordable, but a fabulous benefit for business
 travelers.  Most coverage plans require that the plan only be utilized when the
 patient is 150 miles away from home.  If the company has numerous employees that
 travel from state to state or around the globe on business, then this just may 
be a benefit that should be added to the company\u8217\'92s roster.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 A medical
 emergency can\u8217\'92t be planned.  No one heads off on a business trip and expects
 to become ill or injured, but in reality, this may be the case.  Should such a 
circumstance arise while an employee is away on business, it is important that they
 be able to return home as quickly as possible.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The cost 
of transportation by air ambulance can cost anywhere from $10,000 to $75,000 per
 trip.  Air ambulance service coverage can be used anywhere around the globe.  For
 a minimal annual or monthly fee, the air ambulance transportation cost can be minimized
 dramatically, or even reduced completely.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Employees

 will want to protect themselves, their family, and their wallet while they are 
away on business and air ambulance service coverage is just the way to do it.  \par

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 As you shop
 for coverage plans for your employees, be certain to compare prices closely.  Read
 the fine-print on the plan and be cautious of several exclusions of coverage.

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Some key 
issues to consider before signing up include the specific details of the coverage
 plan.  For the best coverage, make sure that the air ambulance will arrive for 
pickup of the patient regardless of medical need.  This will ensure that employees
 are transported safely back home to family and the hospital in the health insurance
 plan network.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The patient
 should be able to determine the final hospital destination.  Employees who have
 a preference of a local hospital will truly appreciate this option.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Lastly, confirm
 that the air ambulance service coverage is not only nationwide, but global coverage
.  Making this determination will broaden the spectrum of opportunity for this valuable
 benefit.  For companies with overseas travelers, this benefit will be extremely
 popular with the employees.\par}
