Downloading Free Ipod Video Games Tip 1-
Don't break the law. There are literally thousands of torrent sites which give you just about anything as a free download, but did you know they are strictly against the law? You are taking a huge risk by using sites like these, as it is easy for law enforcement to find your address and other details. If the authorities decide to hunt you down, they will. Of course there are also moral considerations. A lot of the people who develop video games are not exactly rich. By stealing their produce you are helping to drive them out of business.

Use a genuine download site. The internet is absolutely riddled with sites which offer free downloads of this and that and anything else that’s popular. Many of them are not reputable, with lots of popups and ads which can coerce you into clicking them just to leave the site. There is nothing clever about this. I don’t trust any site with popups as they prove that the site which uses them does not value or respect the visitor. Use caution and common sense when assessing download sites.

Try to find a site which has a neat appearance, without too many ads. Sites like this are usually run well, by professionals, and a professional site makes for safer downloads. When we find a professional site, we can have confidence about the speed of the download, and that the file will work. With some of the poor sites, you can wait a very long time for the download, only to find that the file doesn't work anyway.

Be prepared to pay money for a quality product. Although we are here to discuss free games, it is often necessary to pay a one off membership fee to ensure the best download speeds and quality.

Although I was reluctant at first to pay up front I have found that I have downloaded far more than the value of the fee I paid, so it’s a win-win situation.
