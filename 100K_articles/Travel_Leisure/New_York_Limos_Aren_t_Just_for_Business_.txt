Article Body:
When most people think of New York limos, those shiny black luxury cars, they think of LaGuardia airport transportation or Newark airport transportation, or perhaps picking up and dropping off business people. The New York limousine business does that, of course, but they also perform a whole variety of other services, some of which you may not be familiar with: Limos can be rented for all sorts of events, from weddings to graduations to proms to a night on the town or going to a ball game. Just imagine:

Planning for a wedding is a big, stressful project where any number of things can go wrong. Staying on schedule is supremely important and everyone needs to be there on time. Making sure a large number of people get there safely and enjoyably in New York City is a job for professionals, and a limo service can do it. Whether is just that certain something special for the bride and groom after they exchange their vows, or comfortable transportation for the entire bridal party or the families, luxury car services can make sure that everything goes off like clockwork. Your guests will appreciate it.

Ever feel the need to really kick back and enjoy an evening of visiting the finest clubs? If you do, you know that time can get away when you party. And there's nothing worse to ruin a great evening and mood than to have to wait for a cab or walk when you can't find one. At the end of the night you may well be quite exhausted, and then it's certainly good to know you'll be driven back to your hotel or home safe and sound. Oh, and if you don't like waiting in line, limo drivers can often cut them for you. Should things get a bit wild, you can be assured that limo drivers are discrete and courteous and will take good care of you.

If you plan on going to catch a ballgame with your buddies or business associates, why not do it in style and rent a limo? The leading New York limo companies can accommodate any size group. You can ask for a late model luxury car, such as an S-Class Mercedes or a 7-Series BMW, you can get a stretch limo, a stretch SUV, or even a specially equipped bus with all the luxury you'd expect in a limo. Groups with as many as 20 can easily be accommodated. Not only do you arrive fresh and with a touch of class, but the limo will be waiting for you when the game is over, even if it goes into overtime or extra innings. 

Want to reward your son or daughter for their academic achievements? Why not make graduation a day to remember forever not only for finally being done with school, but also for being taken there in a Stretch Hummer or something equally outrageous? They will never forget it and it costs less than you think.

So next time you see a shiny black New York limos, remember that they're not just for business. Think what using a limo could do for you!
