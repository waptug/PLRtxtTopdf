With so many different cellular phone options, you may wonder if there is any special advantage to purchasing one of the several Samsung phones on the market today. Actually, there are some good reasons for going with Samsung as your phone of choice.  Here are a few examples.

Price

Generally speaking, Samsung phones are priced competitively with other phones on the market today. Prices will vary, depending on the features included with the unit, which means there is probably at least one Samsung cell phone that will fit just about any need. If there is a limited budget for cell phones, then looking at what Samsung has to offer just makes sense.

Features

Samsung offers units that range from basic features to a wide range of extras.  For people who simply don't need much more than a reliable connection, the ability to make and receive calls, and maintain an address book, there are several models that will work very well. At the same time, Samsung has phones with Internet capability, messaging, audio and visual media streaming, cameras, and all sorts of other options. There is a good chance that whatever the consumer wants, there is a Samsung phone that will fill the bill.

Locking and Unlocking

Many types of Samsung phones can be unlocked from the service provider and temporarily or permanently used with another network. While the process will vary somewhat from one phone to another, this is usually not a difficult task. However, there are some models of Samsung phones that are not designed for unlocking, so it is always a good idea to check before making your final purchase. 

Many major service providers support the use of Samsung phones, with several of the providers actively promoting Samsung units as the phones of choice. Make a list of the features you want, and visit a cell phone retail outlet that carries Samsung products. In addition to models that are currently in the store, you should also be able to obtain information about other Samsung phones that can be special ordered. Chances are you will be able to identify at least a few models that will fit both your wants and your budget.
