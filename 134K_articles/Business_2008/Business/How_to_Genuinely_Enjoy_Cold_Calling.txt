<p>Five perspectives that will (honestly!) create enjoyment in your cold calling</p>

<p>Most of us dread our days of making cold calls. We take a deep breath, pump ourselves up, and prepare to talk with a perfect stranger. Is there any wonder a gray cloud sometimes hangs over our desk? </p>

<p>It really doesn't have to be this way. Cold calling can be an interesting, intriguing, fulfilling adventure. </p>

<p>Here are five perspectives that will give you an entirely new outlook on cold calling. When you apply these new perspectives, cold calling can actually be enjoyable. It can become personally fulfilling as well as financially rewarding. </p>

1. <p>Focus on Helping the Other Person</p>

<p>It’s against our nature as human beings to create an uncomfortable situation with another person. That’s the core reason many of us get that knot in our stomach when we start dialing a cold call. </p>

<p>When we’re only focused on making the sale, this is not a natural meeting place for both people. We want the sale, but the other person usually wants us to go away. Being intrusive is not the finest of character traits, and on some level we know it. </p>

<p>So how can we feel good about cold calling? We change our mindset from getting the sale into being helpful. We look at cold calling as an opportunity to assist. </p>

<p>How can we possibly feel uncomfortable doing that? Helping people is one of the best character traits we possess.</p>

<p>When cold calling is aligned with our very best way of being, it becomes an adventure. We truly want to help people. We feel very good about this, and it shows in our voice. People hear it. And their response will surprise you. </p>

2. <p>Be Honest and Truthful</p>

<p>You’re in a very good place when you choose to be truthful in your cold calling. If you’re not trying to fool anyone, you naturally feel better about making the call. You know that you’re trustworthy. And people respond to you in a positive way. </p>

<p>When you approach a potential client with integrity and common sense, you’re more personable and less tense. Being fully honest is one of your better attributes. And it gives you an opportunity to enjoy the interaction rather than being artificial or manipulative. </p>

<p>People do seem to have a sixth sense about integrity. When they feel you can be trusted, you can truly shine as a person as well as a potential supplier. </p>

3. <p>Be Yourself</p>

<p>Engage people in natural conversation. The more natural you are, the more comfortable you will feel. This makes the other person feel more comfortable as well. </p>

<p>Avoid playing a role, especially reading from a script. Most people can tell when you’re using a script. There’s nothing personal about it, and they pick up on that. </p>

<p>Being artificial puts you in the "typical salesperson" category, which is exactly the role most of us detest. It doesn’t feel authentic. And unless you’re a born actor, it makes you feel skittish about cold calling. </p>

<p>Give yourself permission to follow the rhythm of natural interaction. Allow the conversation to "breathe." Let it be the kind of conversation you would have with a friend. </p>

<p>Practice this and it can turn your cold calls into pleasant conversations. And you may actually look forward to meeting that new person the next time you pick up the phone.</p>

4. <p>Get into the Other Person’s World</p>

<p>Shift your mindset away from what you have to offer and focus instead on what their problem is. </p>

<p>So many of us have been trained think about our services and products, that we don’t think about the client’s point of view. We aren’t really interested in their issues and how we can help solve them. </p>

<p>Be interested in their world and their challenges. You’ll find this intriguing. Most of us have a natural flair for problem solving. We enjoy "fixing things. "So find out what’s going on with the person you’re talking to. </p>

<p>Make sure the solution you have really does "fix it. "Get rid of any hidden agendas and truly listen. Let them know you’re interested in them and their world. </p>

<p>Move outside your own sales agenda to focus on the needs of others. This makes you a better human being and helps you leap past the fear of cold calling. </p>

5. <p>Let Go of Expectations</p>

<p>Never assume anything beforehand. Allow the conversation to be one of exploration and discovery. Stay focused on the dialogue instead of any private agenda. </p>

<p>Determine whether it makes sense to continue the conversation by truly listening. Never presume your prospect should buy what you have to offer, even when it seems they’re a perfect fit. </p>

<p>You are not calling to create a situation that is focused on your personal gain, but on helping the other person. Simply have a conversation to explore whether you can help them in some way. This takes pressure off both of you. You’ll be more relaxed and they’ll be more honest about where they stand. </p>

<p>Believe me, once you start applying these perspectives it will transform your day-to-day work life. Instead of dreading cold calling, you’ll anticipate the adventure of creating a situation where everybody wins.</p>
