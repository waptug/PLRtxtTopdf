Consumer electronics have become a major part of our everyday lives, whether we think so or not. You don't have to be a tech freak to have most of your life somewhat dependant upon electronics. This dependency seems to grow more and more with each new generation as well. If you run through a typical day, you might notice just how many consumer electronics that you use. There are also many new devices coming out all of the time to fill the void that was lacking a device to fill it.

Most of us will start our day to the tune of an electric alarm clock. Then as we get ready in the morning we will use a couple of other devices ranging from an electric shaver to an electric iron. You may then heat up some breakfast in a microwave or toaster while the electric coffee maker brews a fresh pot. The point is that you have hardly started your day and most of the morning was spent using various electronics. With a normal work week most of us do not have time to manually do everything. Consumer electronics mainly fulfill two duties. They either provide a useful function and/or they entertain us.

Most of the electronics that fulfill a function of daily life are similar to the aforementioned products that you may use in the morning. Many others include things like refrigerators and washing machines. These appliances make everyday chores take a fraction of the time. Our electronics also make us more comfortable with climate control for our homes and water heaters for our faucets. You do not need to shop the latest products to be dependant upon electronics.

Besides consumer electronics that are used for everyday functions, there are ones that are purely for our interest and entertainment. MP3 player, portable gaming devices and camcorders all provide for entertainment everyday. There are also items like computers and cell phones that provide daily functions and entertainment. Our consumer electronics improve more every year to provide functionality and consumer satisfaction. More and more each year these products also fuse the gap between entertainment and functionality which promises them a place in our shopping carts.
