        <p>Identify the types of companies you want to work with and a realistic number of companies you want to target over a given period of time.

Keep an eye on your industry and stay aware of new developments. </p>
        <p>Track the companies you approach in a database ( you could use Microsoft Excel or Access). Tracking should cover the obvious things (company contact details etc) as well as details of what was discussed, potential works, actions and more. </p>

            <p>• How can their website help you understand them better? </p>
            <p>• Do you have any conflicts of interest in pursuing this company? </p>
            <p>• Does this client have growth potential or would it be a quick job? </p>
            <p>• Who makes the decisions? How can you reach them? </p>
            <p>3. <strong>Raise your business profile </strong></p>
            <p>By raising your company profile (no matter how small you are) you'll be able to generate new business with less effort. As a leader in the industry new business will come to you. There are many ways to raise your profile; you could try sponsoring events, adverts and gaining media coverage. The size, location and target market of your business this will dictate what medium to use and the areas to cover. </p>
            <p>4. <strong>Show them what you're made of </strong></p>
            <p>Start to reach your qualified opportunities by showcasing your company's products. Send them a brochure or a copy of any newsletters you produce and invite them to join; show off examples of your work; highlight relevant media articles. </p>
        <p>Develop standard template letters in Word to send to potential clients to accompany your credentials/brochures. Ensure you link to your database (Excel, Access or Outlook) when merging the letters and envelopes to ensure you don't have to re-enter details. </p>
        <p>There is no specified time for this courting so be patient. It could be six months before anything comes to fruition. </p>

During the meeting be sure to demonstrate the knowledge you have developed in the previous stages. </p>
        <p>6. <strong>Follow up </strong></p>
        <p>You've presented your capabilities and ideas. Don't stop there. Follow up is essential. This is a major part of the process and should be taken as seriously as the other steps. You'll probably be able to build on ideas from the meeting, or you might find an interesting/relevant article or statistics you could send to re-open discussion. Even if you don't have anything to send, thank them for the opportunity. </p>
