No matter the type of business you are in, if you use your computer system extensively to take care of business, any disruption of your system can be a debilitating experience. Fire, flood or other natural disaster can wipe out your records in the blink of an eye. Having data backup systems with a copy of all irreplaceable records maintained off site will allow you to restore your business records and get you back on track quickly.

Whether you use disk storage, tape storage or online data backup systems having everything that cannot be easily recreated saved away from the business is an important part of you safety net. Just like you carry property insurance, having data backup systems just in case, is equally important to your business’s future.

Keep Backup Files In Safe Location

Any of your files that have been updated or changed will need to be sent to your data backup systems, and al information, regardless of how minor it may be, should be backed up daily. You should also make sure you create your backup files on what is termed reliable media. While compact disks are inexpensive and easily made, they do have a limited shelf life and many times you may find the disk is unreadable.

More often people are using tape drive data backup systems to store their important files. Once created the tapes will last virtually forever and can be stored off site easily with minimal space. Although a tape storage system can be expensive, it may be worth the investment. Especially for large daily files as tapes are available that can hold over a terra-byte of information.

When you file your tapes or compact disks, if for some reason you have no business on a given day and no backup media is made, you should put a note in with your materials so that five years from now, if needed, you will not be going crazy looking for a tape or disk that never existed in the first place. Otherwise each tape or disk should be marked with the date clearly visible that encompasses the information on the media.
