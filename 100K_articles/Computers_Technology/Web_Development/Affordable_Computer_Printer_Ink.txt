The computer – once considered a luxury item – has easily become a staple in today’s modern homes; augmenting our businesses, making modern commerce a previously unheard of convenience, and putting informational and entertainment resources at our fingertips.

And along with the home computer comes its myriad of accompaniments – the modem, the speakers, the scanner, and the printer, to name a few. The printer, used virtually every time a school project, work assignment, or shopping receipt warrants it, is far and away one of the more utilized pieces of equipment. But when the ink runs dry, consumers are left with the promise of a high priced-replacement.

Computer printer ink can be one of the most expensive accoutrements for the modern computer. And, because of the regular need for replacement, it can be an expense that crops up more often than we’d like.

Replacing computer printer ink with a new cartridge available in most retail chains can be the most expensive option. Fortunately, there are a number of alternatives that can help keep the cost of your computer printer ink to a minimum.

First and foremost, look for generic ink cartridges in smaller supply stores. In many cases, the exorbitant prices you pay can be largely based on brand names. Just like anything else, it pays to shop around.

Additionally, rather than replacing the entire computer printer ink cartridge, consumers can instead just replace the ink. There are a variety of smaller, local stores that will replace the ink in your existing cartridge for a nominal fee. In this way, not only are you saving money, but you’re cutting down on waste in the environment.

Computer printer ink refilling kits are also available for those who feel comfortable enough refilling ink cartridges on their own. Ink cartridge refill kits are generally commercial in nature and can be found in large computer supply stores and even online.

Finally, conservation is your best way to increasing the economy of your computer printer ink. Use the minimal amount of ink to print each of your projects; print in draft form or in black and white for everything but your most important projects.

Your computer printer ink doesn’t have to be cost-prohibitive. Look for alternative solutions to ensure an efficient and cost-effective means for successful printing.
