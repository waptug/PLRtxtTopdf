Wedding Etiquette on Tipping and Other Lost Wedding Etiquette<br><br>

Even in our modern times, wedding etiquette still survives. The wedding etiquette that we have come to know dates back from the Victorian era. Victorians are known for their education, intelligence, social grace and manners.<br><br> 

The wedding etiquette on who should pay for the wedding has changed a bit although the old Victorian wedding etiquette, the father of the bride should host the wedding, is still being practiced today. Because of economic issues and that both couples are already earning their own money, the bride and groom today hosts their own wedding.<br><br> 

On social graces, some Victorian Wedding Etiquette still exists like having bridesmaids and groomsmen on your wedding and throwing the bride's bouquet for maidens to catch.<br><br> 

But on the issue of wedding etiquette on tipping, does tipping of the hat to greet the newlyweds still exist?<br><br>

Wedding Etiquette on tipping is an old Victorian social grace of which people from many parts of Europe also do practice. But as time has passed, the etiquette of tipping a hat to acknowledge a person or greet a newlywed is becoming an obsolete etiquette.<br><br>

One of the reasons, according to some wedding etiquette specialists, is that the modern clothing has excluded hat as part of fashion. So, how would a person do a tipping when there is no hat to beging tipping with?<br><br>

American formal clothing does not include a hat, unlike in some European countries, a hat is still part of their fashion. This is the reason why the wedding etiquette on tipping from some European countries is still being practiced.<br><br>

Wedding etiquette on tipping is not a big issue anymore in American society. In fact, most wedding etiquette books that we have now do not mention anything about wedding etiquette on tipping nor they have mentioned anything about it being an old custom of the American society.<br><br> 

But there are couples who wish that their guests would practice the wedding etiquette on tipping. These couples are those who celebrate their wedding with a Victorian era wedding theme, or the 1950's Casablanca theme of which fashion from these years requires a hat to complete an ensemble.<br><br> 

Aside from wedding etiquette on tipping, another lost wedding etiquette on our society is the choosing of bridesmaids younger than the bride and requiring them to wear a dress similar as that of the bride.<br><br> 

Today, this wedding etiquette, just like the wedding etiquette on tipping is completely lost. Brides now choose older and sometimes even married bridesmaid. This is not being scorned today, but yesterday, during the time when wedding etiquette on tipping is being practice, bridesmaids are young and really maiden.<br><br>

The reason behind the Victorian wedding etiquette on young and maiden bridesmaids came from the old belief that a devil is tasked to abduct brides during their wedding day so that he could have her for himself before her groom can take her. The bridesmaids acted as decoy, being maiden and wearing dress that resembles the bride's dress will confuse the devil as to who is the real bride.<br><br> 

This wedding etiquette has been passed on from generation to generation until it evolved and became the wedding etiquette that we have now. According to wedding etiquette specialists, this practice has long been forgetten because people, through time, has become modernized and become less superstitious. Besides, the bride can now have her favorite sister or best friend, even if she is older than her or married, to be at her side on her very special day.<br><br>

There are still lots of wedding etiquettes before that have been changed to fit our current culture and society. In fact, some of the modern wedding etiquette we have now may also become oblete in time, like the way the wedding etiquette on tipping and wedding etiquette on bridesmaids that our culture had before.
