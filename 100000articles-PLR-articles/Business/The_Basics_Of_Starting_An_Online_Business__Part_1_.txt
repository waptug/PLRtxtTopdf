The main thing about starting an online business is having a product to sell that customers want to buy. You can spend all the money you want setting up an elaborate website with colourful graphics. If the product is not enticing to customers or if you don't advertise it in the appropriate way, your online business will not make any money. Just as you would with a brick and mortar business, you need to start with a business plan so that you know what you need to do in each step of the process.

In most cases, you don't need as much money to get started in an online business as you would with a regular business. For one thing, you don't need to rent office or warehouse space and you don't need to have as many employees. Many of the successful online businesses only have one employee. This is because these people operate out of their home and use part of the basement to store the inventory. Since all the business is conducted online, they only need a computer with an Internet connection to connect with the customers.

An online business starts with setting up a website telling customers about your product. Since customers can't actually touch and sample the product, it is the words you write that will do the selling for you. Even if you purchase Adwords and advertise your product on other sites, when potential customers come to your site they need expert articles about the product that will convince them to buy. The cost of setting up this business is the purchase of a domain name and web hosting, which don't add up to very much money. Then you have to spend time building your site by adding more pages or products.

If you already have an existing business, you can make your presence known by having a website. This helps to draw customers into your store because they will want to examine the product themselves. It will also give you more exposure to potential customers farther away from you when they can order the products they want online and have them shipped to their addresses.
