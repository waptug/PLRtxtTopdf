Article Body:
Ever wonder what makes a millionaire different from your average Joe?  Why is it some are "meant" for riches while others are "meant" for poverty?  Well, it is simply a choice.

When you realize that to have success is to simply choose success is when you will see results in your life.  Now you're probably wondering how does somebody choose success?  If you were to go back and study all of the successful entrepreneurs, for example Ford, Edison, Gates, they all had one thing in common: The Mindset For Success.

It's not just luck or by chance that people are successful nor does someone happen to just make a million dollars.  The elite realize that there are exercises, daily practices, and knowledge that can get anyone to the top and this knowledge is accessible to anyone who truly desires wealth in their life.  

Now, how does someone jump over the gap from being an employee to becoming a successful entrepreneur and living a lifestyle of absolute freedom and abundance?  Well, without the right training, without daily mental preparation, this task would seem insurmountable.  However, with the right people mentoring you and with the knowledge that can get you basically anything you desire, YOU CAN'T FAIL!  The only x-factor is you; do you really believe that you weren't meant to have success and wealth in your life, but that wealth and success were meant for others?  Ask yourself, are you truly ready to leap from mediocrity to excellence?  

You Now Have a Choice...
