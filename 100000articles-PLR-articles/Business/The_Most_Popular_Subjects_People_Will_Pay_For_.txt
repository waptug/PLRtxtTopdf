Here's a list of some of the most popular subjects people are paying for... 

• Dating, Seduction, Sex Advice, Relationships 

• Losing weight, gaining muscle, looking more attractive 

• Health & fitness, cures/reliefs from specific diseases & ailments 

• Spying, online privacy and security 

• Safety, personal security, and protection of self and loved ones (self defense, home security, scam prevention, etc.) 

• How to use computers and the Internet 

• Mental influence, persuasion, and dominance 

• General self-help, self improvement, personal development, and success 

• Hobbies and special interests: cooking, magic, UFO's, metaphysics, becoming more competitive in sports, activities, etc. 

• Making money, aside from marketing information: investing, stock market, futures trading, real estate tips, and other related financial information 

• And of course, having more control and freedom in their lives! 

People are always looking to improve themselves or some area of their lives. They are always trying to find solutions to problems. 

There are sites catering to some of the above categories that are already generating thousands of dollars every month. I have personally sold products on some of the above categories and done very well. 

Yet, we haven't even begun to tap the true profit potential in these areas yet because there's very little competition in most of these areas, especially when compared to the "how-to marketing" area! The potential to make money from the above special-interest categories is huge - and it's wide open! 

Moreover, as more and more people get accustomed to buying digital products, you can easily imagine making insane amounts of money through these topics well into the future. 

You could pick any one of the above subjects that you personally have an interest in and run with it.
