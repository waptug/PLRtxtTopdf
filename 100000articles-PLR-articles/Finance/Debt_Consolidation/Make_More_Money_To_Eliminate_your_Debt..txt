Article Body:
How can someone stay far away from debts? You must have a plan, and if you can't, find a coach or a financial adviser, and get a good money management plan.

First, you must eradicate bad habits:

1.Don't spend more than you earn even if it seems difficult, it is the best way to stay away from debt for good. That is why you need to get more money, otherwise this point alone will be very difficult to apply.

2.When you have any debt, try to clear it right away. Another reason to get more money.

3.Write everything (Computer or Paper). You must keep a record of all your debt with you, and know what is going on in your account on a daily basis.

4.Give your card to your husband(or to your wife – or mother -)

5.Stay away from gambling (not for everyone).

6.Don't accumulate debts months after months.

It seems very easy, but people just fail to follow this simple plan, and the consequences are often painful... Divorce, foreclosures, bankruptcy...

So you must:

==> Change your habits

==> Choose an action plan

==> Write down this plan

==> Stay away of your credit card

==> See the interest rate as your enemy

==> Don't go to a “Debt continuation service”, “Christian” or else

==> Learn how to know and control yourself(your emotion)

==> Earn more money



Internet is giving to everybody an easy way to start and be in business in less than one week starting from scratch. It is the solution to a lot of problem, and the best is that if it doesn't work(I prefer to say if you did not put your heart to make it work), you just start another business the same day, and this one may become profitable.

In 2006, more and more people will start successful Internet businesses. There is a lot of opportunities to profit from.

“Debt isn't the real problem, the source of the problem is that you need more money.”
