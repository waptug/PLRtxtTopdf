Born from jets – this is the tagline that Saab automobiles are famous for. Saab is proud of this unique heritage. This is what makes Saab different from the rest of the automakers of the world. Saab was predominantly an aircraft company when it was founded in 1937 by sixteen aircraft engineers in Sweden. The name Saab is an acronym for Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolag or The Swedish Aeroplane Company. 

In the late 1940s, Saab ventured into the automobile industry. Because of Saab’s origins in the world of aircrafts, subsequent Saab automobile models had the most aerodynamic profiles in the industry. To this day, most Saab models still offer superior aerodynamics. Today, Saab Automobile AB is now owned by General Motors. 

Saab is known in the American automotive industry for its luxury vehicles with a distinct European touch. Some of Saab’s more popular models include 9-2X AWD, the 9-3 Sport Sedan, the 9-3 Convertible, the 9-3 SportCombi, 9-5 sedan, 9-5 SportWagon and the 9-7 SUV. All these models offered distinctive Scandinavian design elements and superior automotive engineering. 

Saab vehicle owners enjoy luxury car features and renowned European automotive technology. Every Saab model is built to serve its owner reliably for years to come. Otherwise, Saab owners can also purchase replacement parts if ever time and constant use has taken its toll on their Saabs. Damages incurred during operation such as minor bumps and collisions can be easily remedied using high quality Saab replacement parts.
