Government auctions are your answer if you want to drive a Jaguar or Lexus, a car that you have always wanted to own but could never afford.  There have been many instances when we have seen a BMW or a Mercedes Benz on the road and they speed away before you can change gears in your car. The only thing that crosses our mind at that point is they must be very rich or a leading personality in the town to drive in such a luxurious car.  For all you know, they might have picked up the car at a Government auction for $750 - $1000. Since many are not aware of these auctions, the select few take advantage and benefit from them. Most of the cars at the auction are Government seized cars that might have been brought in by the police or by others who reported sights of abandoned cars in their streets.

While picking up a car through Government auctions, make sure to check the condition of the car to not get conned into buying a car which is missing a few parts which was removed when it was seized. Not all cars are in such conditions, most of them are actually be in good condition and there would be no problem with you buying such a car. If you were able to outbid the others and yours is the highest price quoted, the Mercedes could become yours. It is now your turn to take the car out on the streets and show it off to the world and maybe make another soul like yours jealous. Little do people realize that through these Government auctions one can buy a car they normally would not be able to afford. And this is possible only because Government would do anything to be rid of the cars that are accumulated in their storage place.

Now, depending on whether you desire a luxury car or just wish to purchase a car at a price cheaper than at the car dealer, you can try government car auctions. They even have fleet cars and surplus vehicles for your benefit. Some of the others might have been condemned or and rendered old, but will be in good running condition and give decent mileages. If you are a smart buyer, you will be able to find some interesting and high saving deals at these Government auctions. And since these auctions are not held after doing a lot of advertising, it is only a certain group of people who are aware of their operations and schedules. Therefore, they benefit from them and might spread the word to their friends or family members if are looking to purchase a car.  

At almost all government car auctions, the interested parties are allowed to view the vehicles that are up for auction and conduct physical checks they deem necessary. Also, never get into a bidding competition with other people if you are not aware of how much the car is worth.
