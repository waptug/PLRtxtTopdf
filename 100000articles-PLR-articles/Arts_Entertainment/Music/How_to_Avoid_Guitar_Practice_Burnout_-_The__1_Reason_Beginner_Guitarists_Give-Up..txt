<b>How to Avoid Guitar Practice Burnout:</b>

<b>1)</b> <i>Enjoy the process of learning guitar.</i>

This sounds basic, but often beginner guitarist's will focus on negative aspects about their guitar playing skill level. Instead of "beating yourself up" remember that all professional guitarists started off just like you. The truth is that learning guitar takes time, patience and practice.

So slow and steady guitar lessons will benefit you best for long-term success.

<b>2)</b> <i>Use the quality guitar learning methods.</i>

Many people find that learning to play guitar using traditional methods is too difficult, overwhelming and time consuming. And because of this difficulty, many people give up on their dreams of learning to play guitar because the guitar learning techniques were inadequate.

Luckily though, now days you can get online guitar lessons that teach a new and revolutionary way to learn guitar that produces fast and effective results.  These new guitar lesson techniques make learning guitar fun and easy. So, if learning guitar using traditional guitar methods is too difficult, or causing you too much frustration, know that there are new and improved ways to learn guitar that work extremely well. 

<b>3)</b> <i>Learn to practice guitar at your pace.</i>

In learning to play guitar, you'll discover that some days you're more motivated than other days.

For example, some days you'll feel like playing the guitar for hours on end, and at other times, you'll only want to practice guitar for a few minutes. This is normal and if it's one of your "off days" allow yourself to enjoy a break from a long practice section without feeling guilty.

<b>4)</b> <i>Look to others for inspiration.</i>

One of the best motivators in trying to achieve any goal, like learning guitar, is to look to other people for help and assistance. Consider joining a musicians group and online music forums where you can share tips, successes and troubles with other guitarists online.

Chances are, there will be another guitar player who has had the same problem you're facing who can give you great
advice.  Learning how other people achieved their guitar playing success, and the pitfalls they incountered along the way (and how to avoid them), will help tremendously to inspire and motivate you along the way while learning guitar.

<b>The #1 Reason Beginner Guitarists Give-Up:</b>

The biggest reason many people new to learning guitar give-up is because they loose the JOY of learning to play guitar.  Why?  Many beginner guitarists are excited about their new hobby, and this excitement causes many people to rush into trying to play their first song as quickly as possible.

However by not FIRST taking the time to learn proper guitar basics, usually results in increased playing difficulties and frustration. And frustration is what eventually leads many beginners to give-up on their dreams of playing the guitar.

But don't worry! By following the tips above, you'll be well ahead of most people learning to play guitar.
