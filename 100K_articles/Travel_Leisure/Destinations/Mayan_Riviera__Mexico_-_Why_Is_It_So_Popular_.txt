<u>Costs and Atmosphere on the Mayan Riviera</u>

For visitors from continental Europe or the UK there is the added attraction of the current favorable exchange rate. This can make traveling to the Mayan Riviera a more cost-effective option than visiting Southern Europe over a two-week stay.

Warm breezes and your favorite cocktail served at your sun bed - now that's what I call a holiday!

The island of Cozumel is a real magnate for diving enthusiasts, offering deeper water closer to the shore than the mainland resorts.
