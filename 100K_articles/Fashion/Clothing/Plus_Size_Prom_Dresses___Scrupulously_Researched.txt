It is almost May and prom season is upon us.  I remember the shopping for dresses when I was younger.  I dragged my mom to every dress shop in our city and then I think I ended up getting a dress I saw at the first store we went to; isn’t this what 17 year old girls always do?  Prom season is an exciting and stressful time for young girls.  Finding a date, arranging a limo, ordering corsages, and all the other little details that go into planning a prom.

I have to say though the dress shopping was the best part.  Granted by the end it was frustrating and tiring, it was still fun to try on such a wide array of sparkling littering gowns, in the desperate search fro the one that would make you feel like Cinderella at the ball.  I think I must have tried on 100 dresses my senior year, but I started early.  As any experience shopper knows, you have to start shopping months in advance otherwise there is nothing left except large plus size prom dresses and little tiny things that a 12 year old could fit into.  Believe me the dress selection is of the utmost importance.  Every girl wants to be the prettiest girl at the prom and it is a hard decision.  

The first prom I went to I put off the dress shopping and ended up having a very hard time finding a dress.  I thought about buying a plus size prom dress and having it taken in because there was nothing left in my size.  I kicked myself for a while but in the end I found the most perfect dress anyone could have imagined. It sounds frivolous and superficial but for many girls their first prom is the first major formal event they get to attend and finding that dress that makes you feel like a princess is crucial.
