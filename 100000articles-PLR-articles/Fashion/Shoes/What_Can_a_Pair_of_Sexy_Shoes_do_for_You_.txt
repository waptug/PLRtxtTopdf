When it comes time to looking and feeling good about yourself, there is no substitution for a stylish pair of sexy shoes.  

Sexy shoes can help you to gain a level of self confidence that might otherwise be unachievable.  

Put on a pair of sexy high heels and they will boost you up to a new height that you might not be accustomed to.  This will draw more attention to you thus increasing your confidence.

Additionally, wearing a pair of sexy high heel shoes will alter your stance having the effect of pushing your breasts up and forcing your buttocks outward.  Both of these traits are highly appealing to the visually oriented male.

Many people feel that wearing sexy shoes even makes their feet appear smaller than they actually are.

Another wonderful benefit of dawning a pair of sexy heels is that they elongate the lines of the legs.  This makes the legs look thinner and much more elegant to the onlooker.
