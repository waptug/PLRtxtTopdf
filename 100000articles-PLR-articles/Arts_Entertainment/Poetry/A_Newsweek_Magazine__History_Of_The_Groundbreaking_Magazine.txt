Now bigger than life and ultimately credible, there’s no literate person on earth who doesn’t know what Newsweek is. However, before all the awards and the public trust is gained. There is a past… a colorful history which marks the rise of a small publication to one that will sweep the world off its feet.

It all happened in February 17, 1933. The first issue of this news magazine was far from the colorful and astounding publication we all read today. All it had on the cover were seven pictures from the week’s headlines. Inside, you’ll find interpretative stories, signed columns and other international editions. As time progressed and the readership got bigger, Thomas J.C Martin’s newly founded News-Week became bigger by the second.

In 1937, new leadership gave the news magazine a much needed boost. It all happened when Malcolm Muir took charge as editor in Chief and President of the publication. One of his first moves was top change the news magazines name to Newsweek, abolishing the hyphen, which made the name look too complicated. After that, the popularity of Newsweek Magazine became quite phenomenal. In ten years, this news magazine grew into what can be perceived as a classic replica of what it has become today.

In fact, it became so big, that the Washington Post Company couldn’t help but buy it in 1961. It is during that time that it cemented its status as one of the most liberal publications of the era. Its growth continued until it became the big fish that it has become today.

Through the years, Newsweek has also has accumulated quite a number of controversies. Some of the more groundbreaking and sometimes, earth rattling articles received mixed reactions. Some of them were controversial exposes on Guantanamo Bay Islamic injustice, the best high schools in America and other war stories. These heated, controversial and impressively liberal stories on war focused on American waged wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

As of now, Newsweek stands mightily on the pedestal of journalistic success. It is known to reach worldwide circulation of no less than four million copies a year, including 3.1 million copies syndicated in the U.S alone. It also employs multilingual publishing practices as shown in their Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian and Arabic editions. It also operates with more than 17 bureaus reaching as far as Paris and Tokyo. It has even produced its own Radio show called Newsweek on Air.

There is no telling what lies in store for the behemoth of the publishing world. Whatever this leader in the news industry decides to embark on next will undoubtedly be ahead of the rest of the pack.
