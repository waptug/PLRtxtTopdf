Here are some points to remember about digital photography pointers:

Ever see a fantastic scene outside your bay window at home or your car window and wonder whether you can shoot a good picture through glass? The answer is, yes, you can. All you need to do is stand as close as you can to the glass when you take the shot. This minimizes the effect of light reflecting on the shiny surface of the glass.

Would you like to take some shots of rectangular paintings to put in an online gallery, but fear they'll come out resembling parallelograms instead of rectangles? Don't worry. Digital photography can work for you in this case if you line your camera and picture up so that they are perfectly parallel. If you raise the picture on the wall and the camera on a tripod so that the center of the camera lenses is trained right on the center of the picture should do the trick, and you'll seem like a pro.

Have you tried to take pictures of children at play and been dissatisfied because the great scene you tried to capture is already gone by the time you push the shutter button, and you're left with something not very interesting and perhaps unclear? You might know the solution to this. Increase your shutter speed because that will help freeze action. Also, knowing that your tykes are almost always in motion, try to discern where the action is going next, and point the camera there and you'll have a better chance of catching the next perfect moment developing before you.

Have you quit taking nighttime shots because whenever you took pictures of your friends at an evening gathering with your new digital camera the shots were all way too dark With this problem you do the opposite from what you do to get great shots of kids at play. You decrease your shutter speed-1/15 or 1/30 of a second rather than the standard 1/60 of a second should do it for you.

Perhaps one of the most important things is to read the instruction manual that came with your camera, and you should try out all of the features to see how they work. Also, find others who are interested in learning how to make the most of digital photography. Share tips and go out on picture taking adventures together. Sooner or later you'll be giving other people much better tips than these in no time!
