“Free Your Time”

Of course, information rules the world. Modern man deals with e-information. But many inconveniences are waiting for him. If one wants to work with business papers at home, it’s necessary to copy all the files on flash drives or CD beforehand. But copying can be too annoying if the number of files and essential applications is enormous.   
And if your business requires sharing files with customers, employees, partners, or consultants it’s even more difficult. If you need to gather input from several people on the same document then file hosting is irreplaceable. If you have employees who travel, work in branch offices, or work from home, only file hosting can provide easy access to all the necessary data and files.
By the way, even businessmen have spare time occasionally.  And everyone wants to have his or her favorite songs, movies and home video on hands, but not to drag it all over the place. With file hosting there is no need to use snail-mail, or cut big files in parts in order to attach it to e-mail. 

“How does it work?”  

There are many file hosting servers on the Net. And you can choose one by yourself. We’ll mention one of them – OxyShare.com. The founders of this site say that they wanted to create a server that would be as close as possible to business requirements. Practical persons don’t need to waste their time on registering or watching annoying commercials. A plain design disposes one to working. The only thing, which is optional - is to choose a file and click upload. After that you obtain the link for this file and can host it or share it. More importantly, the OxyServer uses a foolproof method of data hosting and guarantees that all data and files will be preserved. 
All files that you upload to OxyServer are accessible 24/7 from any Internet-connected hardware. So if you are tired of delivery failures because your E-mail attachment is too large, or of maddeningly slow E-mail downloads, then file hosting is your choice.
