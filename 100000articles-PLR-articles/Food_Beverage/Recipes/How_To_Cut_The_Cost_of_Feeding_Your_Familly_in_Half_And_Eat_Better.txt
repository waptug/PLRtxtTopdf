After more than 30 years of practiced shopping to save money, My wife and I can truly claim victory. Having produced 3 boys early, we had to find ways to feed all five of us with the best food for the least amount of money, since my wife stayed home with the children(most of the time), so there was only one paycheck.

A few basic suggestions:

1- Buy "store brand" name whenever possible.

2- buy as little "prepared" foods as is possible.

3- Keep stock of these low-cost and high nutritional value foods:

   Pasta, dried beans and rice. 

4- Set some time aside for bulk meal preparation that can be frozen for later use when
   time is more critical. 


How you prepare your food stocks will also contribute to your monthly food expense since your cooking costs are part of your food bill. Some suggestions here might not be so obvious, such as using your microwave, assuming your have one, instead of your stovetop or oven, be it gas or electric. Most people do not realize that stovetop cooking can be 3 or more times more expensive than using your microwave and that the specific savings depends on the make and model of the electric or gas stove you use and the size of the microwave. In most cases, the cost saving switching the greater part of preparing your meals to the microwave will be very noticable after the first month.

Here is how to enjoy Oriental Rice at less than 25% the cost of your favorite restaurant.
