Have you ever wished that you have eyes everywhere? If you are a parent, a business owner, or a wife with a philandering husband, I bet you do. There's comfort in knowing what the people in our lives - whether we want them there or not - are up to. Of course, you can always say that you are just making sure there are no untoward incidents in your absence, even when in truth, you are simply as curious as a cat. You can get away with it, however.

Be Like a "Ghost"

DVR software, also known as digital video recording software, is probably the best thing that ever happened to nosy people everywhere. You can now know for sure if the boy dating your teenage daughter is getting help other than homework, or if the new girl in your clothing store is not secretly taking the latest stock of skinny jeans for herself. The best part is you don't have to be there to actually see these things! With DVR software, there are no unguarded moments. It's the closest thing to being all-seeing and being in all places at once.

DVR software gives you the power to watch and to see anywhere. All you need to do is download the DVR software, choose how many "eyes" or cameras you want to have, and voila! You will never miss anything again. You can see what your employees are up to while you lie on your bed, or if the nanny is talking on the phone again while you're on the beach, or if your children found their father's magazine collection while you work. Even if you're in India, for example, you'll know for sure if your husband is really playing tennis like he claimed he was doing. You can use the DVR software to access your cameras remotely so it really doesn't matter where you are in the world, as long as you're connected to that wonderful thing called the Internet.

Better than Television

As nosy or as curious as you might be, you probably don't have all day to sit in front of your computer and wait for people to do something interesting. Don't fret, though, because DVR software has the capability to record and save the live video feeds on your hard disk. Not only that, you can save precious hard disk space by setting up your DVR software to start recording only when it detects motion. This way, you don't have to go through hours and hours of boring and empty footage. With these amazing features, you can go about your daily business like a normal person while your DVR software records the days of other people's lives. At the end of the day, you can curl up on your couch with a nice cup of tea and watch the recorded videos. That's way better than prime time television!

Best Kind of Pleasure - Guilty Pleasure

Strange as it may seem, DVR software is only an indulgence to the basic human nature of wanting to watch and see, albeit a rather expensive one. But no one wants to share their voyeuristic tendencies. So, what did the geniuses behind the DVR software do? They design the DVR software in such a way it can be password-protected, and as long as you can keep your own secret, nobody would be the wiser.

So, what are you waiting for? Download a DVR software today so you can have uninterrupted viewing pleasure of your favorite reality television show, starring the people who share your life.
