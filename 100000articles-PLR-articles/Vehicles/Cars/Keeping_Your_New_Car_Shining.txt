Article Body:
One of the best things about owning a new car is its smooth, shiny "showroom" look. Maintaining that look-by washing and waxing your car regularly and touching up any scratches-can keep it looking new longer. 

Fortunately, the latest cars are finished with a high-tech process that makes it easier for car owners to maintain that new-car look. Many cars on the market today have a powder coated finish that helps protect them from chips and scratches, as well as damage caused by UV rays, harsh weather, salt spray and acid rain. 

A clearcoat can protect the car's high-gloss finish, which keeps your car looking new longer. 

Several of America's car manufacturers have discovered that this technique offers many advantages over liquid paint. The environmentally friendly finishing process eliminates the need for costly waste-disposal equipment and oversprayed powder particles can be recovered and reused. 

Some of the manufacturers using this process include GM, Chrysler, BMW, Volvo, Lincoln, Chevrolet, Mercedes-Benz and Dodge. Every bit of exposed metal in DaimlerChrysler's European Smart Car has been powder coated. 

It's not just the outside of the cars that benefits from powder coating. As well as having an exterior clearcoat, many new cars also have powder coated decorative wheels, hubcaps and trim. It's even used on truck beds, door handles and engine parts. 

It isn't only car manufacturers that have discovered the process. It's found on thousands of home and garden products, as well as sporting goods, recreational vehicles and office furniture and equipment. 

It has become a universally preferred method of finishing for all the same reasons it has been so enthusiastically adopted by car manufacturers.
