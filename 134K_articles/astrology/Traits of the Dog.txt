Traits of the Dog

Loyal to a fault, the dog is the eleventh sign of the Chinese Zodiac. Dog people will stand by their family and friends, even when they shouldn’t. Sensitive and compassionate, those with the dog sign empathize with the pain you feel. They take it as if it were their own. This can lead the dog to make excuses for those who are less than respectful toward them. Dogs will also meddle in your personal life, in the name of trying to help. They mean well and most dogs will understand when you suggest they back off. 
Dog people are usually cool headed in a crisis. They are the ones you can count on during hectic, stressful times. 
Honest, strong, intelligent, and practical, dogs will accept whatever fate throws at them and handle it with poise and grace. You can count on people of the dog to do their work thoroughly and well. 
Of course, there is a negative side to the sign of the dog. To be born under dog influence is to be idealist. Dog people have a very clear idea of right and wrong, there is very little room in their heart for shades of grey. Oftentimes, this makes them intolerant of those who show weakness. Dogs do not accept weakness in themselves, either. 
Dog people tend to come across to others as excessively critical, even picky. The dog will see every flaw, and their sense of propriety will not allow them to over look even the smallest flaws. They are perfectionists. 
Dog people will do whatever it takes to protect their family and friends and they are unselfish, and only want the best for those they care about.
Those with the dog sign will do well for themselves if they choose friends carefully and remember that not everyone deserves their steadfast loyalty.
