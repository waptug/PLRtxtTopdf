Article Body:
Sunglasses are essential as a summer accessory! They have been popular for a long time, not only to protect your eyes, but also to complete your fashion statement. When the sun is bright we wear sunglasses all through the year. Sunglasses are even more useful in the summer because it is a time for relaxation and recreation. 

Sunglasses provide important protection for your eyes. Whether you have several inexpensive pairs or one good pair, there are certain things to look for when you buy sunglasses. Look for glasses that block 99% ultraviolet rays.

UV Protection

Prolonged exposure to UV rays can be harmful to the eyes and have been linked to eye disease. People with eye disease, such as macular degeneration or retinal dystrophies need to protect their eyes when they go outside. Persons who have had cataract surgery may need extra protection too.

Mirrored sunglasses offer relief from glare but not necessarily UV protection. You should wear lenses dark enough for the brightness in which you will wear them. For especially bright conditions, such as snow skiing or water sports, you will be more comfortable with a darker lens. In most daily conditions you can wear sunglasses with a medium darkness.

Polarized glasses reduce reflected glare such as sunlight reflecting off water, pavement, or snow. They can also be combined with UV protection and are perfect for driving and fishing. The wraparound style is helpful in keeping UV rays from entering the eyes from the sides.
