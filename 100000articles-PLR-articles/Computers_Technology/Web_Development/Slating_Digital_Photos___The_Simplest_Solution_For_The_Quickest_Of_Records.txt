Today’s slating digital photo devices come from the effort of movie-makers to shoot sound and image at the same time as chronologically as possible. Now digital slating is used to synchronize sound and image in cameras as the two were shot separately. But outside professional media, very many people use slating digital photos for sheer fun. But let’s see business application first!

Slating digital photos improves work organization, since it actually involves indexing them in a very reliable way. Slating is new in photography, but it was first successfully used in the film-making industry. It helped maintain continuity of hand props, set dressing and wardrobe. Now the method is so widely used, that it has come to help you sort the various digital photos you take, particularly if you have loads of them.

The first to profit from slating digital photo devices are those people who make a living of photography, and have to achieve photos on various topics, sets, dates and further specific criteria.  Acrylic stales are the considered to be the best on the market; they usually come together with a fine tipped dry marker. On the back of the slate, you write the message by which you want to file the photo.

Your personal message used to identify a photo will then be recorded. Hence, after being photographed, the written notes are stored on the memory card together with the picture they describe. Remember that slating digital photos is sequential, so that every piece of noting you make will be displayed together with the photo it describes. 

The device comes with a variety of screen-printed formats that can be adapted to the user’s individual needs. Far from being exclusively used by photographers, thought they are the main target, slating digital photo techniques are a way to express yourself creatively in documentation without having to learn any specialized alphabet or scroll some complex menu.
