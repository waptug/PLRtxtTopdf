The success of any debt consolidation plan is dependent on how you stick to it. This is of course obvious, but it should be known that though getting out of debt can be challenging, it can surely be accomplished with the right dedication and perseverance. So keeping this point in mind, it is important to remember that you take some extra steps to give your debt consolidation plan the best chance to succeed.

The most important thing to implement and remember in any debt consolidation plan is to cut up all your credit cards, except for one or two, which can be used in emergencies. To symbolize a fresh start to your financial status, it is important that you take your debt consolidation plan seriously and thus throw away the pieces of your credit cards. For you to be able to create your own debt consolidation plan, it is important that you cancel all your credit lines and thus request a lower rate of interest on the remaining debt. With this, you should get an idea on how much money you will be expecting to cover with your debt consolidation plan. 

Another point to remember and implement in your debt consolidation plan is to transfer as much debt as possible to the credit card having the lowest interest rate. This credit card will then be the focus of your debt consolidation plan, rather than the many different loans you have from different creditors. Another option for your debt consolidation plan to consider is to get a debt consolidation loan from a bank at a lower rate. To make sure that you will stick to your debt consolidation plan, and also not accrue further debts, it is important that you use cash for all your purchases, and to buy only what you can afford. Remember, if you don't have the money for it, then it is probable that you don't need it anyway! Remmebe that you are cutting down on your luxuries with a reason, and make it a point to focus on your debt consolidation plan. Never be tempted to think that one small charge on a credit card won't have a negative impact on your debt consolidation, as it very much will! Remember, that there will be another sale coming to your favorite store in the future, but this is your only chance to get all your finances back on track. It is very important that you stick on your debt consolidation plan for this to happen. 

The most important point of focus of your debt consolidation plan would be to commit yourself to start paying off your debts one at a time, and not only say this, to do it too! Make it a point to pay off the credit card and loans with the highest rate of interest first so that you give your plan the best possible start and thus, a better chance at success in the long run.
