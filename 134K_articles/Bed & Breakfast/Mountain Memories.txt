Mountain Memories

Situated on top of one of Georgia's famous mountains, Mountain Memories bed and breakfast offers a majestic view of the Georgian mountains. From the gazebo, your room or out on the deck, the only word to describe the view of the sunsets or lake Chatuge, is magnanimous Fall in love all over again on a romantic getaway in one of the six rooms or even a private cabin.

The Lovers Suite holds a white washed, pencil post king bed with a bedside Armoire. The complete lovers fantasy comes complete with terry robes, candles and a rubber ducky. A sleeper sofa accentuates the romantic king bed and the gas log fireplace. But no room is complete without the rubber ducky. Decorated in green and burgundy, the Southern Pine Suite boasts a four-poster king bed, sleeper sofa and coffee table. The first two-room suite we encounter is the Sunset Suite. A queen sized bed and ruffled end tables occupy one room with a futon, coffee and end tables in the other. No mountain retreat would be without a self-named room, so we now enter the Mountain Mist Suite. Joining the queen-sized bed is the armoire and chaise lounge and two-person shower. The last of the rooms is the Queen Anne Suite. Upon entering we notice the queen bed alcove and sleeper sofa. 

This mountain resort also has cabins to rent. Stone Creek Cabin has the authentic look of a log house as the settlers lived in. Hiawasse Heights Cabin offers a panoramic view of the mountains of Georgia. The View cabin lives up to its name, as the majesty of the sights is breathtaking. Bring a video camera because that is the only way you will be able to explain the view. All the cabins offer an unobstructed view of Lake Chatuge and the flowing Georgia countryside.
