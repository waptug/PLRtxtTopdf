We all have ways of testing opportunities that enter our lives.  Some of us just dive right in based on feeling, others walk straight into what they know is right by a gut feeling or intuition.  And if it’s not gut feelings or emotions that are the tests of opportunities, it is the logical mind persuading us to ignore those feelings and emotions and test it with our reality of reason.

Most of us do not have a predetermined strategy for testing opportunities, or even more generally to test the actions we take and the choices we make in our lives.

There is an easier way to determine if our choices we make and the opportunities we receive ‘pass the test’.  This simple 32 word statement of business ethics was first created in the 1930s and used to turn around a failing company.  These four questions were applied by each employee to each and to every minute detail of the company’s workings.  This little list of four questions from Rotary International, a humanitarian business organization, is the most widely printed, translated and reproduced piece of business ethics today:

“Of the things we say, think or do:
1.	Is it the TRUTH?
2.	Is it FAIR to all concerned?
3.	Will it build GOODWILL and BETTER FRIENDSHIPS?
4.	Will it be BENEFICIAL to all concerned?”

If we built businesses and our lives based on these very simple 4 questions we would be coming from a place completely the opposite of the competitive mind and the lack mentality.  As you can see, these questions prompt you to choose what is true, fair, and good, making choices that can build friendships and goodwill.  It helps us to see how the choices we make can be beneficial to all concerned.  

Because of our societal influences, we most often are inclined to make choices and act based on a competitive mind.  This comes from the perspective of lack, scarcity, and ultimately greed.

Any opportunity based on the model of competition and lack will simply not pass the test.  Competition promotes strife.  It embodies winning one spot, taking it away from all the other people who want it.  It misleads people to believing there is only one chance for success, when in reality there is plenty for all.

The competitive model encourages people to rely on a source outside of themselves to give them what they need.  This denies the power of their own ability to create what they want.  This narrow focus shows they are choosing to ignore the possibility of creating this opportunity in their own lives, instead of trying to win the spot from millions of others.

This simple testing technique takes us completely out of the competitive mind of greed, scarcity and lack.  It turns our thoughts and choices toward the positive, realizing there are opportunities we can take that can provide increase for all concerned.

I invite you to use these questions to test your actions and opportunities in your life.  If you are seeking opportunity, these questions may help you see things in a different way.  In doing this, perhaps you might find an opportunity in your life which truly allows you to benefit the world, while at the same time reaching whatever your dreams, goals, and desires are.
