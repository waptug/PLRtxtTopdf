Doing the Wedding Invitation <br><br>

Weddings should be well-planned. Any bride or groom will not want the one important event in her and his life to be just ordinary. That is why it is important for would-be-wed couples to be enlightened and follow several wedding etiquettes. <br><br>

A lot of mistakes, misdeeds and bad gestures almost always ruin or spoil weddings. Be it on the part of the bride and the groom, the parents, the guests or even the bride’s maids and groom’s men, there are wedding and proper etiquettes that could be adhered to. <br><br>

Wedding etiquettes are important so people can show to others that they have been raise well and with good and proper breeding. People’s actions also speak a lot about a person, and most uf us want others to speak good of us. <br><br>

Wedding etiquettes: From the top <br><br>

Wedding etiquettes are followed even during the initial stage or phase of the wedding---the planning and short listing of guests. <br><br>

Today, soon-to-be-wed couples are almost always hiring wedding planners to take care of even the smallest details of the forth coming wedding. <br><br>

But there are still several aspects where the couple should attend to personally. For one, doing the wedding invitation should not be left to the wedding planners. <br><br>

The soon-to-be-wed couple should make sure that their wedding invitation is personalized. Of course, they are overjoyed in their coming blissful matrimony, and it should show and be conveyed through the wedding invitation. <br><br>

Sincerity of wordings and aesthetic style of the wedding invitation will certainly do a lot of wonders. <br><br>

There are a few other mediums the couple could use today to convey invitations to short listed guests. For one, the guests can be reached through e-mail. <br><br>

E-mails are almost always informal. Through this, the language used is more personalized, thus, sincerity can be truly and freely conveyed. <br><br>

Another informal channel if conveying wedding invitations is through word of mouth, or the gossip factory. <br><br>

Words spread faster than we know. Through this, the invitation is conveyed in the third person manner. For example, a forth coming wedding of John and Gina is conveyed through the following word of mouth entry: “Hey, John and Gina are tying the knot this Saturday, 6 pm at the Imperial Suites. I heard the couple’s wedding would be strictly formal.” <br><br>

Doing the formal wedding invitation <br><br>

Most wedding experts and life stylists still recommend formal wedding invitations over other forms of invites. <br><br>

Formal wedding invitations will convey sincerity, style and seriousness. But did you know that the words used in wedding invitations will equally hold a great weight or bearing as that of the message itself? <br><br>

In adherence to numerous and multiple wedding etiquette guides, the words in the wedding invitation should be written in the third person. Meaning, the pronouns used should be he, she, him, her, their, them. <br><br>

The invitations, bearing the third-person writing format should strictly be printed on heavyweight cream, white or ivory paper. Even the font style should be paid much attention to. According to several wedding etiquette books, traditional and formal wedding invitations should be using classic style letter fonts like Roman. <br><br>

In our modern times, the couple usually pays for all the costs of the wedding. But did you know that traditionally, it is the bride’s parents who carry the burden? <br><br>

Western wedding etiquettes have it that the parents of both the bride and the groom can shoulder the expenses for the coming wedding. This may not be economical and likely on the part of the parents, but that is wedding etiquette, and the tradition must live on. <br><br>

Usually, since the parents are the one covering the wedding and the reception, wedding invitations are written, still in the third person style, but as if the parents are one the inviting the guests. <br><br>

To illustrate clearly how wedding invitations should be worded in accordance to wedding etiquette guidelines, check on the following examples: <br><br>
