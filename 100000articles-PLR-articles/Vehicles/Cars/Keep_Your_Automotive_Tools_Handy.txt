Now that you have your own car, it is important that you do have the right automotive tools in handy. This is because you would never know when your car might act up and you would need to do some adjustments or repairs yourself. You should have a set of the basic and the most used automotive tools for car owners. These automotive tools should be kept handy either in a car repair kit or box inside your car or even in your car’s trunk. 

One of the first things that you should purchase for your car’s tool kit would be an adjustable wrench. This tool has the ability to actually automatically adjust to the size of the nut and could loosen or tighten everything. You should shell out around $10 to $40 for this one. 

You should include a continuity tester. It is an electrical test equipment. You can use this to check if there is an electrical path that can be made between two points. This is good for testing electrical parts in your car. This should cost you around $3 to $40. 

For around $1.50 each, you should get a couple of funnels. This should help you out greatly in adding fluids and oils in your car. Make sure that you clean them after using them and also make sure that you use only one funnel for each fluid. For example, you should only use one funnel for adding brake fluid. Never use this funnel to add oil or washer fluid. 

Do not forget to put in a car jack. You should spend around $9 for this one. You should use this in case you need to change your tires. This is one of the indispensable items that you should not forget to include in your automotive tool kit.
