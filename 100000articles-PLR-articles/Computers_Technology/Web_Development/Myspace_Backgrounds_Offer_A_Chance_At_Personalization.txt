If you are one of the boring types, then you might enjoy the basic backgrounds that MySpace gives out with its profiles. They offer a few different designs that might fit your needs and suit your fancy. If you find one of those that fits your profile, then it is easy to implement them on your profile.

Perhaps you have always loved playing with Barbie? No matter the case, there is a good chance you will find a background representing this.
