Pilates exercise equipment can help make a wonderful workout program into an amazing way to transform your body. There are a handful of useful items available that will help you maximize the benefits of your routine. These helpful tools are great for the seasoned exerciser as well as the beginner.

The first piece of Pilates exercise equipment you want to get is a DVD that offers a viewing of a typical routine. You simply work out right with the people on the screen. While this is not the newest innovation in Pilates exercise equipment it is the most important item. 

Following a good plan is simple if you have the instructor right there with you. Those of us who can’t afford a personal trainer opt to buy the DVD Pilates exercise equipment instead. Using a DVD will help you finish a complete routine without skimping. It also provides great motivation for the user. 

The Pilates ball is a favorite among people of all abilities. This Pilates exercise equipment is just plain fun. You can accomplish a lot in a workout by balancing on one of these large bouncy balls without feeling a thing. The results are great and you barely break a sweat. This is among the most popular Pilates exercise equipment on the market.

One of the most important aspects of this type of workout program is its safety. This approach to fitness is very kind to the body. In fact, it is even used in some physical rehabilitation approaches. This is a very appealing feature that is the key to the Pilates workout. People of all ages and abilities are able to use this program.

No matter how safe any workout is you really want to choose a mat when completing floor exercises. Pilates exercise equipment includes this necessity to floor workouts. I think that this is one of the most important pieces of Pilates exercise equipment, especially if you have hardwood floors.

Resistance bands are great for adding a little more challenge to the routine. While the resistance bands are not an absolute necessity to a successful workout they can really help to keep things interesting for the advanced client. This Pilates exercise equipment can be introduced at the intermediate level but I really wouldn’t recommend it for beginners.

There are various other items that can be used to supplement the workout. No matter if you use additional Pilates exercise equipment or not you will definitely see results if you stick with the routine.
