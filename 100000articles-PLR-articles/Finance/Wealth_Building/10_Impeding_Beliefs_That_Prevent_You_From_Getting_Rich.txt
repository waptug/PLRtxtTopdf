At one point in your life, you may ask yourself why other people are so successful with money when you’re not. Depending on how closely you look, you will have several answers. Do these sound familiar?

- They’re just luckier than I am
- They have a better education than I do
- They were born into a rich family
- They are white and have better opportunities than I do
- They already had money to start a business
- They already had money to invest in real estate
- They are smarter than I am
- They are younger than I am
- They look better than I do
- They probably work harder than I do

The list probably continues to fill several pages. Money is the topic that generates the most beliefs, followed by the topic of relationship. I once led a seminar where we investigated people’s beliefs about money. After only 30 minutes we came up with 3 full pages!

Beliefs - Blueprint of Your Reality

You may not know this yet, but your beliefs are the blueprint of your reality. If you knew that, would you deliberately create one from the list above? Probably not, because these beliefs are not supportive at all. These beliefs create a reality that leaves you ‘playing’ the victim, and on top of it, keeps you right where you are. You are not improving your life one bit.

Why are we creating these beliefs in the first place, when we know that they are not constructive at all? The answer lies in the nature of our consciousness. Most of us were told that there is a universe out there and this universe shapes our reality. It is the basic belief that life happens to us. Most of us get these beliefs confirmed several times per day. The result is that our consciousness gets imprinted each day with the same message. The message with the same old belief.

Meanwhile, as adults, we are not even aware that our life ‘as it happens’ is built around a belief. It becomes a profound reality that we prove to ourselves in each moment.

So how do we get out of this dilemma? We need to take a step back and look at our beliefs. Take a piece of paper and a pencil and write down all the beliefs you have around money. Don’t think too much, be spontaneous. When you have run out of your own beliefs, think about what other people’s beliefs are about money.

Then mark each belief with an ‘I’ or an ‘S’ depending if the belief is impeding or supportive. Impeding beliefs do not support creating wealth, supportive beliefs do. Now, look at your list and count each supportive and impeding belief. What is your score? How many impeding beliefs do you have, and how many supportive beliefs do you have?

Imprinting New Beliefs

Realize that all the impeding beliefs do not support the creation of fortune. Now, take a new piece of paper, and brainstorm beliefs that will exactly create the wealth you would like to have. When you are done with the list, go over each of your new beliefs and create a mental image. Hold this mental image for at least 10-20 seconds. You may need some practice, but every time you do it, you will get better with it. Do this exercise in a quiet, calm, and relaxed environment, as this will help to imprint these beliefs into your consciousness.

Remember, beliefs are the blueprint of what will manifest in your life. With a little training, you will be able to move on to the next stage, which is feeling your beliefs. Feel as if these new beliefs, that foster what you really want to create, have actually been manifested.

- How does it feel to be a millionaire?
- How does it feel to have abundance in your life?
- How does it feel to have more money than you can spend?
- How does it feel to give to others?
- How does it feel to buy without having to look at the price?

Whenever you catch yourself thinking or speaking an impeding belief about money, stop what you are doing. Go back to the place in your mind where you recall one of your deliberately created beliefs about money, and connect with it. The more you do this, the more you will train your mind to think in a new way. A way that leads to being rich.

By the way - this method actually uses principles of quantum physics. However, that is another story…
