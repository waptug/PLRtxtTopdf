Cell phones require accessories for three main purposes – to enable complete utilization of the cell phone, for safety of the cell phone and its user and to enhance its appearance.

Purchasing cell phones accessories is not an easy task, not certainly today. This is because there are a large number of accessories manufactured by different cell phones companies available in the market today. Some of these accessories are equally good in quality and go neck to neck in terms of features provided. Hence, it is absolutely impossible in certain cases to determine the right one.

Battery
This is the most important accessory for a cell phone. Your cell phone must be kept turned on continuously to make or receive calls. If the battery runs out, the call gets disconnected and the phone gets shut down automatically. So if you are going on a long trip, it is advisable to keep a spare battery with you.

Cell boost
This acts as a spare power source for your cell phone if your battery runs out suddenly. It is in shape of a small container which can be carried easily in your bag. It charges up your cell phone in quick time, adding to it battery power output of 60 min talktime. It can be used in combination with different brands of cell phones like Motorola, Nokia, LG, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, and Siemens phones.

However, you should note that cell boost cannot be recharged like your normal cell battery. It can be used only once and disposed off immediately. Hence, you should use the cell boost only for situations of emergency power needs.

USB data cable kit
The USB data cable helps to synchronize your desktop PC with your cell phone. By doing this, you can easily transfer data between your mobile phone and your PC. The USB cable usually comes with a software that helps you manipulate and manage all the applications of your mobile phone from your PC. This software can be run in a number of other languages besides English.

Bluetooth devices
Bluetooth devices are similar to USB cables in providing connectivity with other devices like PC, except in the fact that these devices provide wireless connection and don’t require the use of connecting cables. By using these, you can establish connectivity with other bluetooth capable devices. These include bluetooth-capable cell phones, headsets, cameras, Global Positioning System (GPS) devices, printers, keyboards and handheld computers.
