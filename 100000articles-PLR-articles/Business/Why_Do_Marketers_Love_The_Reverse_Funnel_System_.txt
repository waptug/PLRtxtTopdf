Simply because the Reverse Funnel System does exactly what it’s suppose to do.  The Reverse funnel system is an expert system designed by expert internet marketers to automate the building of a highly profitable internet business.

The reverse funnel system allows entrepreneurs and marketers to do nothing other then focus on traffic generation.  That way you don’t have to spend countless money, hours, and time developing offers that can prove to convert at a decent rate.

The reverse funnel system has ALL of that created for you.  That’s why the reverse funnel system is breaking records throughout the internet marketing community.

There has NEVER been a system designed that converts as high as this system does.  The entire system was designed by expert copywriters, for over $25,000 per page.  This system has allowed average people to take advantage of systems, copywriting, and a funnel process that they normally never would have access too.

Because of this, many entrepreneurs from all over the world have created more full time income from home using highly converting systems like this then has ever existed before.  Any one who is truly interested in marketing, needs to focus their attention on marketing a funnel that CONVERTS the highest based on the traffic you run through that funnel.

This simple equation is the key to getting paid the most for what your effort and energy is worth.  If you affiliate marketers and entrepreneurs keep promoting products that have low conversions and low commissions, they will continue to limit the amount they could actually be making for that same marketing effort.
