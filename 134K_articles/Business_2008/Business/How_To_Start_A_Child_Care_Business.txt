When you’re beginning to set up your own child care business, you should consider the following six things in order to be both successful and safe.

Type of business

When you’re first thinking about setting up a private child care business, you’ll want to think about the location of your business. Some people like to work from their home when they have ample space, while others want to travel to their business.

If you do not want to work from home, you might consider commercial options that would give you a partnership with other similar businesses in a franchise arrangement.

The legal side

Before you even begin, you need to talk to your local business services in order to see what kinds of licenses and other legal conditions you have to gain. Find out what kinds of requirements are needed to earn them as well as the costs that you may incur.

These can include health code regulations and inspections as well as fire code and more. It will depend on the location in which your business will be situated.

Education for you

You will also want to consider any special training and certifications that you might need in order to run a successful child care business. This might include first aid classes, CPR, as well as certifications in child care and child development.

Any of these certifications will further legitimize your business in the eyes of parents.

Insurance needs

You will also want to find out the amount of insurance that you will need to cover any damages or injuries that might occur during the life of your business. If you’re running the business from your home, you will need to increase the limits of your current policy, or in some cases, buy a separate policy.

If you’re running your child care business from outside of your home, you will need to look into insurance for that facility.

Checking out the market

A lot of business owners don’t stop to think if the current location that they are in is appropriate for the business services that they want to provide. You can start to research this by calling other child care providers to see if they have more clients than they can handle or if they aren’t filling up their business on a consistent basis.

Of course, these answers may not mean as much if you find a location near a business with many parents that need child care. If you are convenient for your market, then you can be more competitive.

Figuring out what you need

Generally speaking, you should sit down and determine how much money it will take to start up your child care business as well as the equipment that will need to be purchased with this money. You might also want to consider if you will need additional staffing to take care of more children than you can handle by yourself.

Your child care business starts with careful attention and planning. Get out that pad of paper today and start thinking about what you need in order to give the children the best place to stay.
