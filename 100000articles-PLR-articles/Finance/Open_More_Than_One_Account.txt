If you are looking for a way to save money, but always find yourself dipping into your funds, try opening up more than one account at your bank.

By having more than one account you will be able to keep your money separated, which will help you avoid spending cash that you should not be touching. Of course this can all be done with one account and some self control, but it is not always that easy. By having an account for many different reasons, you will be able to keep your money separated, and only withdraw funds from the appropriate account.

The first account that you will want to set up is a savings account. You should put money into this account and never touch it unless you are in an absolute emergency. Savings accounts will also earn you interest depending on how much money you keep in the account. This will give you an incentive to keep as much money as possible in your account.

Next, you will want to have a checking account that you can use to pay any bills that you may have. This way, you will know exactly how much money you have available each month for your bills. By having a checking account you will also ensure yourself of never having to go into your savings to pay bills.

Also, many people have found it to be very beneficial to start a personal account where they keep money that they only use for leisure. By doing this, you will be able to keep track of how much money you spend on things outside of bills. This will also help you to learn to budget your money more efficiently.

You can also open a separate account for any special items that you are saving for. If you want to take a dream vacation, why not open an account for this? Then you will be able to put a certain amount of money into the account every month in order to reach your goal. Many people overlook this type of account, but it offers many benefits and advantages.

Overall, having a number of different bank accounts is a great idea. This will allow you to easily control your spending and saving. You should open as many accounts as you need in order to keep your finances organized. By doing this you will soon find out that you are more organized than ever before.
