Traits of a Gemini
  
Webster's Dictionary defines "Mercurial" as "characterized by rapid and unpredictable changeableness of mood."  With Mercury ruling, there's no better definition of Gemini, either.  Gemini encompasses both sides of human nature, the light and the dark, the cheerful and the somber, and this duality appears in every aspect of the life of a Gemini. 
Gemini can change their moods and attitudes as easily as others change their socks.  One moment, they are sociable and cheerful; the next, moody and restless.  They tend to be frustrated with people who straddle the fence, because they know where they stand at that precise moment.  Of course, they may be on the other side of that fence the next day, but that's a different subject. 
A Gemini can--and likely does--handle multiple tasks with ease.  They are at least as comfortable multi-tasking than most people are with a single project.  In fact, they would likely get bored handling a single task, and would be miserable at rote memorization or dull monotonous chores. 
With their gifts for communication and imagination, Gemini are natural storytellers.  They have a keen sense of humor, plenty of tact, and a flair for diplomacy.  What they don't have are persistence and patience.  If they're not careful, their tendencies towards moodiness and restlessness can be their undoing. 
The easiest way to frustrate a Gemini is to force them to hold to a routine.  Like a caged wild animal, they will not handle the situation well at all.  Gemini don't like to be chained to the everyday world; they need to fly and wander and embrace new things wherever possible. 
Be wary of a Gemini used car salesman.  The smoothest talker of the Zodiac, Gemini could sell ice to Eskimos and leave them thinking they got the better end of the deal.
