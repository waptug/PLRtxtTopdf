You now have your own PSP system and can not wait to start downloading all of the free games, movies, music videos and pictures that you and your friends have been talking about.  Apparently, the sky is the limit when it comes to downloading free things onto your PSP.

Everyone you know is downloading free stuff for their PSP and you want to get in on the action.  You start searching the internet to see what you can get and how to download it to your system.  It seems easy and quick to do.  

You will need a memory stick to download movies and other high graphic items.  The memory stick gives you the extra storage space you need to hold what you download.  The PSP memory stick comes in many different sizes and they range in price from $20 to more than $180 each depending on where you buy them.  Many people that download a lot of files use a separate memory stick for different downloads-one for music, one for movies and ones for games.  Or, you can just get one large memory stick to hold everything.

You can even purchase a media manager for your PSP software so that you can view and share the free movies and photos, play music, and enjoy podcasts.  It is also easy to transfer these free downloads to or from your computer and to share everything with your friends.

This is another great source of free items.  Sharing with your friends is also good-you can all have the same games and actually be able to connect your PSP systems together to play together.

There are literally hundreds of sites you can download free items from.  But, before downloading anything from an internet site, make sure that you read off the information carefully.  There may be a hidden clause 'somewhere' that states that you will actually be agreeing to pay a monthly membership fee for certain periods of time-much like a contract.  If you are now certain that it is free, feel free to download everything you want.  If, however, they ask for a credit card, you might want to reconsider.  Why would an internet site ask for your credit card information if everything is free?  A little common sense will go a long here.

Now, go out and do your internet research and talk to your friends.  Your research and your friends will both give you information on the best places where you can find and download free things to your PSP.

You have been waiting for this new PSP system for what seems like ages and now you have it in your hands.  It is time to purchase the extra memory sticks that you need to store the free information you plan to download.  So go out there and get what you want-whether it is movies, games or music, everything is available for you at the click of a button.   

Enjoy yourself, experiment with the different things you want to download and keep them as long as you want, or delete them and get something else.  With everything available on the internet, you can always get something back again.
