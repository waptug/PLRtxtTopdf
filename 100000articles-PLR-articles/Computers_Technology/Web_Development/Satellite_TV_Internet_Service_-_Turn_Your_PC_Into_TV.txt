With the help of that special software you can turn your PC into a satellite TV playing thousands of entertainment channels from all over the world. This is a clean and simple software solution. No messing up with installing expensive adapters. So, even a computer novice can use this.

And the nice part, the software is quite inexpensive (costs around 50 dollars).

You don’t need expensive hardware in your PC because these companies have set up a server farm that receives the satellite TV programs, converts the programs to digital format and makes them available over Internet as media streams so that users all over the world can receive the Satellite TV programs using their computer. And as the signal is in digital format computers can receive it without any extra adapter.

Unlike other TV services it is not subscription based system that is you don’t have pay every month to get the service. You invest only one time and that is for the software. Keep distance from any company that’s asking for monthly fees.

And there are certain things you’d like to check up before selecting your brand of software, things like whether the software will run on the version of Windows you have, whether it will be accessible from your country etc. Though most of the software works with almost all the versions of windows and can be used from anywhere in the world where there is an Internet connection.
