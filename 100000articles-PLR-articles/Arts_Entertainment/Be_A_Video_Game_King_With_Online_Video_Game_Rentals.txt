Are you a video game buff? And you keep hosting and attending video game parties frequently, despite the fact that they, at times, get too heavy on your pockets? And being a video game buff, it remains your wisest ordeal to review the game as and when it enters the market? 

Come on. You can overcome this unnecessary expense. No I am not telling you to restrict your video gaming passions. Rather go for online video game rentals and find a total answer to all your video gaming. 

For all this and more, all you need to do is visit a website offering you online video game rentals and place the order as per your choice. Many times, the games which are short on stock in the market are available for rent online. And by getting the new title release on rent, you can write reviews and enjoy being the real king of video games. 

But before you go for online video game rentals you must know many aspects regarding online video gaming and video game rentals beforehand. 

First things first, what is a video game rental? If you order an online video game rental, you get an access to an online video game on rent at the complete comfort of your own home. As you order online, the games are sent to you online only. You can definitely browse and order the video games online, as per your choice. 

But before you do so, you must ask– if you want to play one game or many games at a time. Check for the fact if shipping cost of the game is included in your subscription or it may come as a surprise expense to you. Most importantly, check for the fact if the website offers the games that are compatible to your game platform or not? This is essential as most of the websites support Xbox and Playstation2, but they do not have games for original Playstation. 

Always compare the prices and offers, well in advance. Even if the prices offered by various sites seem similar to you, they make a huge difference in the long run. While the prices are all in a similar range, it may seem a minute difference in the beginning. But over the course of a year, the difference adds up hugely. 

There are literally innumerable video game sources on the internet. And you can very easily have access to video game rentals for all the popular game titles for major systems such as Xbox, GameCube, Playstation2, Nintendo DS and GameBoy Advance. 

The popular video game websites such as GameFly, Gamerang, GameznFlix and Gplay offer you thousands of game titles on rent. You can avail the benefits by subscribing with these webmasters for $15-20 per month. The multiple picks at a time, definitely, are more beneficial to you. Your rental habits can also decrease the cost of your future deals with the website. 

Now as you know the ease at which these electronic game rentals are available at, you might again ask why you should pick a game rental rather than buying it. The answer to this query is simply the fact that the rental deal is far cost-effective as compared to a total game buy. Within a few dollars you get to know if the game is worth a purchase or not. 

You certainly get to know if you need to buy or just rent the game for a small period of time. If you loved the time spent with your video game rental, you can decide to buy the game. Online video game rentals also help you rack up the new genres of video games, prior buying them. 

You can also avail video game rentals from video game rental stores and movie rental outlets as well. But online video game rentals undoubtedly remain the most convenient source for video game rentals. 

Video game rentals in fact decide for the ratings of most popular games. The most popular online video game rental picks are: ‘Madden NFL 06’, ‘NCAA Football 06’, ‘God of War’, ‘Sid Meier's Pirates!’, ‘Destroy All Humans’ and ‘Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith’. 

Now if you want to know the downsides of the video game rentals, my answer to you is there is none. The problem, if any, is you must remember to send the games back on time. So happy video gaming!
