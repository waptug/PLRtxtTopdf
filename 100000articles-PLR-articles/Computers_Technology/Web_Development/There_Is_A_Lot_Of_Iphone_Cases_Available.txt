Since the advent of the iPhone, many different cases have been designed by several manufacturers that serve as protection for your iPhone. Just the fact that a case exists does not mean that Apple approves of it as a good iPhone case.

The silicone protection case is one of the many different types available. The iPhone cases made from silicone come in several different colors. Depending on your preference, you can get them in pink, purple, blue, black, and many other colors. The iPhone cases conform to the body of the gadget and also accommodate the various functions of the gadget. Some cases have an open window for the screen area, while others feature a transparent screen protection. Deciding which one is right for you will lead you through many different choices from different manufacturers.

The crystal plastic case is another option to protect your iPhone. Some of these plastic cases feature handy belt clips and they are also available in a rainbow of colors. The hard crystal case also comes with an LCD screen protector. As with silicone cases, the plastic case choices are numerous and have been put to market by many manufacturers.

For the more luxury minded, there are also leather cases for the iPhone. These cases come in many different designs and colors. They are usually made of hard leather and are more bulky than most iPhone cases. They come in different kinds of leather and can be flip lid or pouches.

You can also get pocket pouches that will hold and protect your phone. These are very handy containers of iPhones because they are smaller than most and all you have to do is slide out your iPhone if you want to use it. Other forms of iPhone cases are flip-lid cases that protect the iPhone and give users direct access to the screen by just flipping the lid. Even though they offer good protection, they are bulky and don't easily fit into your pocket.

The iPhone has fast become a fashion statement, and for the fashion followers there are even designer cases by well-known designers such as Louis Vuitton. The fashion industry has found a niche for these specialized gadgets and many of the clients of the big brand names appreciate this.
