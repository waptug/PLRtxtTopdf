Now you can get great ranch naturally. Litehouse Ranch Dressing has no preservatives, no MSG and, because it's made with heart-healthy canola oil, no trans fats, which have been linked with a greater risk of heart disease.

That means you can make healthy recipes that can still get your little dogies to come stampeding to the dinner table. Grilled steak panini with ranch dressing can be a hit with kids and adults. Serve it as a hearty lunch meal, cut up as appetizers or with a tossed salad and a side of corn for dinner.

4 slices sourdough or artisan bread 

1/2 pound steak

4 roasted red peppers
