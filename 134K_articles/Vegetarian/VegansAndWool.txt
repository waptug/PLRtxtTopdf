Why Some Vegans Do Not Wear Wool

Many vegans quit eating meat, eggs, milk, honey, and yeast
for one very specific reason: they have a deep reverence 
for all living things and subsequently want to prevent
all living things from suffering on their behalf.

This reverence for all living things drives some vegans
to what nonvegetarians might consider extremes. Some live
greatly restricted lives, but for a noble cause: to 
prevent suffering and death wherever possible.

In addition to preventing death and suffering through
dietary selections, some vegans have vow to prevent it
in all other capacities.

For instance, some vegans do not wear wool because they 
believe it contributes to animal suffering.

These vegans often cite how scientists have bred sheep 
over the years to generate unnatural amounts of wool for 
human needs. This breeding has resulted in the Merino
sheep of today, which often has enough wool to equal its
body weight.

As a result of this counter-evolutionary trait, the Merino
sheep that exists today often has far more wool than it 
needs, which is evidenced by the high amount of sheep that
die of heat exhaustion. In addition to overheating
in hot temperatures, many sheep end up freezing to
death after they are sheared.

The wool shearing process can also cause quite a bit
of suffering for the sheep. Almost a quarter of all wool 
sheared from sheep is "skin wool," which is so close to 
the sheep’s skin that it is actually must be torn off.

If you currently are a vegetarian for ethical reasons,
take some time to consider whether or not wearing wool
compromises your commitment to end or at least stop 
contributing to animal suffering. 

For some vegetarians, wearing wool is just as bad as 
eating meat; and for others, it simply isn’t an issue 
because they do not believe it causes an unreasonable 
amount of suffering. Which are you?
