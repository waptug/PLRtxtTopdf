The principal of the conference call is very simple. It lets you have a conference without squeezing all of the listeners and speakers into one cramped room. Communication is crucial to any successful business. If you are serious about achieving real growth than you need to look at having a way for your employees to easily communicate with each other and the management.

Some businesses will be lucky and have all of their people working from one convenient location, making the call aspect unnecessary. But then, not all business organizations are as fortunate in that respect. Moreover, any business that wants to expand and have more than just one location needs to consider how it will keep all of its employees in touch with each other.

For this process, there are few options better than a good conference call. For a relatively low price a business can now organize a full teleconference that will let anyone from anywhere link up and share their ideas.

In this same way management can easily discuss new policies and explain new business goals to all of its branches in one convenient sweep. This should be much more definitive than any long winded email that tries to explain every possible contingency or a bunch of ineffective memos.

Conference calls are also priceless when it comes to discussing something with your clients. An expanding business has to focus on reaching out into new areas. This means that you will gain clients from different states and different countries. Communication is going to be the most difficult hurdle in this process though.

Emails just aren't the same as a real discussion and they usually waste precious time. Anyone who has had to play email tag with a friend or client should know exactly what this feels like. A missed email to a person in another time zone can cost you an entire day. On the other hand, it would be careless to rely solely on expensive long distance calls to discuss all of your plans. Most projects will require collaboration from multiple people and will cause you to spend more time catching everyone up on the discussion than actually working out an idea.

A good conference call session would eliminate this problem. A convenient time can usually be work out for both sides except in the most extreme of time zone difference. This conference would then establish a clear idea of what needed to be done. Both sides could work out their ideas in real time and make sure that everything was understood.

A real business needs to have a good setup for communication. Employees across the country need to be on the same page and clients need to be able to have full meetings even if they live in a different time zone. The idea behind a conference call is simple. The conference call is just a virtual meeting for people who cannot have a physical meeting.

If a business lacks this, then it will be at a severe disadvantage and lose significant amounts of money and time due to unnecessary errors and missed messages.
