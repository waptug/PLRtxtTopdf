Let's start by looking at some of the free help available after bankruptcy when it comes to rebuilding your credit. There are some excellent online resources available that show you how to rebuild your credit history - and, of course, some you want to stay away from.

What are some good credit rebuilding resources that can help after bankruptcy? The websites of the major credit reporting agencies are a good starting point (Experian, Equifax, and Trans Union). Many offer helpful articles, as well as "question and answer" sections.

There are also credit rebuilding (or "credit repair") services that offer people help after bankruptcy for a fee. In addition there is credit repair software on the market that people looking for help after bankruptcy can buy. Some services and software packages are good, but there others you will want to avoid. This is where comparison shopping, research, and common sense (i.e, "if it sounds to good to be true, it usually is") comes into play.

There are also books you can purchase that show you how to rebuild your credit history - but again, be very selective in which ones you choose. For example, some books out there suggest illegal or, at the very least, highly questionable credit rebuilding techniques - stay away from these. You don't want that type of help after bankruptcy!

Ideally, when it comes to rebuilding your credit you want utilize resources that are specifically designed for people who need help after bankruptcy. For example, I wrote After Bankruptcy Credit Solutions exclusively for people who need help after bankruptcy when it comes to credit and loans. Of course, rebuilding credit and increasing your credit score are key parts of the book.

Hopefully, you now know of some free and paid resources that can help after bankruptcy when it comes to rebuilding your credit. Again, take time to research and choose the resource that's best for your situation when looking for help after bankruptcy.
