One thing that many people do, who find themselves swimming in a pool of nothing but horrible debt, is obtain a debt consolidation loan. A debt consolidation loan, is a type of loan specifically designed of anyone that has driven themselves into a debt that is well beyond their personal means. This type of loan will enable you to pay off all of your debt with one payment each month, than by having to make several monthly payments. The reason this works is because for the most part, these monthly payments will be lower than all of your monthly payments combined. Therefore, by having one payment each month, there is a higher likelihood of you being able to afford it.

These loans are typically one of two amounts, the entire amount of the debt owed or a large portion thereof. By obtaining a debt consolidation loan, you will enable yourself to pay off all the debt you have incurred and only have one left over, which will be the loan.

Typically those who apply for these types of loans do not have the greatest credit as a result of these debts, therefore the lending agent may require you to have any type of valuable property as collateral, typically a home or vehicle. When you go to apply or consider applying for a loan for debt consolidation, you will need to determine the amount of money you should borrow, this will typically be the entire amount of your debt or the amount of the largest debt that you currently owe. 

By determining this amount, you will be able to better understand what type of collateral you will need to obtain the loan, and will play a large role in the determination of the amount of the monthly payment you will be required to pay and the amount of the interest rate upon the loan. 

There are a variety of terms and conditions that could go along with debt consolidation loans, this is all dependant on the particular lender. Lenders will typically have an amount that is the maximum you are allowed to borrow, this will also be a determination made depending on the value of the collateral you present. Additionally, these types of loans will have a higher rate of interest than a regular loan. However, that higher interest rate could save you lots of money in the long run, because the debt consolidation loan will allow you to better control you debt, make only one payment each month, and could be the decisive factor in rather or not you need to file bankruptcy.
