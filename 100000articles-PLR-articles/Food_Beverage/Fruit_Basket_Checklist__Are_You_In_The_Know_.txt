2)You don't comparison shop before spending your hard earned money.

Well, I was like you too until I discovered a little thing called the internet. The internet makes comparison shopping much easier than it was just 10 years ago. Finding that a product is similarly priced between vendors makes the decision process a lot easier. Fruit basket shopping is no different than any other type of shopping and the internet has revolutionized it as well.

Let's take a look at your fruit basket shopping checklist and help you get a feel for what you should be looking for when fruit basket shopping.

1) Delivery. This is one of the most important things to look for when shopping for a fruit basket. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess that you are buying a fruit basket for someone else as a gift instead of yourself. Not that many people buy fruit baskets and deliver them to themselves. Pay special attention to the delivery qualifications of the vendor you are looking at. In my opinion, FedEx is always the way to go. They get things delivered all over the world. A fruit basket delivered by FedEx can make quite an impression.

2) The quality of the fruit in the basket. Fruit varies in quality from the perfect to the rotten. So do fruit baskets. If you are buying a basket for the first time, make sure the merchant has a reputation for delivering quality goods. Look around the merchant's website for testimonials from happy customers who have used and liked merchant's services and goods before. 

3) Get informed about the different types of fruit baskets. The first 2 points pale in comparison to getting in the know about the different types of fruit baskets. Some are great, some aren't. Learn all about them by doing some homework.
