}What to Expect When Flying in a Jet Air Ambulance\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Medical patients
 requiring transportation over a range of 500 miles or more wouldn\u8217\'92t dream
 of traveling by ambulance.  Air travel in such scenarios often makes much more 
sense, but traveling via conventional aircraft and commercial airlines may not always
 be the most comfortable and safe option for patients.  For this reason, patients
 requiring air ambulance services for long-distance travel will typically fly in
 a specifically equipped  jet.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 If you or
 someone you know ever need to travel by air ambulance in a jet, know that the patient
 will be receiving the highest quality service possible.  The staff on the air ambulance
 jet is highly trained.  The flight crew are not only experienced pilots and very
 familiar with flight safety, but they are also informed and educated about the 
specific needs and circumstances related to flying medical missions.  The goal of
 the flight crew on an air ambulance is to provide the highest safety standards 
possible while ensuring the patient\u8217\'92s comfort from the point of origin 
to the destination in the speediest time possible.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 One jet that
 is commonly used for air ambulance transport is the LEAR 35A.  This specific type
 of aircraft uniquely outperforms many other jets when it comes to transportation
 by air ambulance.  The reason the LEAR 35A is great for such travel is the fact
 that the aircraft is one of the most efficient models for travel for long transport
.  The LEAR 35A has a high safety record.  This type of aircraft is less noisy than
 others in the industry making it very useful.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Most air 
ambulances have executive-style interior allowing for maximum comfort during the
 flight.  A comfortable interior on the air ambulance allows the patient to rest
 in a medical environment during the transport.  The door to the LEAR 35A jet is
 larger than most other cabin doors.  This is yet another feature that makes the
 patient more comfortable.  Loading and unloading on this type of aircraft\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Is easier
 on the patient.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Such air 
ambulance jets are frequently able to land at smaller airports.  Access to more 
airports allows the patient to land closer to the hospital for convenience, comfort
, and most importantly safety.  When time is of the essence, every second counts
.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The air ambulance
 jet contains standard equipment for use during the flight from the point of origin
 to the destination.  Each piece of equipment is thoroughly checked to ensure reliability
 before every single flight.  Laptops and printers are available on air ambulance
 flights for use during the trip.  The medical staff can keep accurate data information
 and print it out for use by other medical personnel upon the patient\u8217\'92s
 arrival to the destination.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Other standard
 safety equipment on an air ambulance flight includes equipment to perform cardiac
 and respiratory lab tests, defibulators, ventilators, and equipment to monitor 
the patient\u8217\'92s vitals and stats during the trip.   \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Travel by
 jet can provide a safe, practical, and speedy method of transportation for patients
 requiring critical care over a long distance.  An air ambulance is equipped with
 high-quality medical equipment\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 And trained
 staff in order to provide the highest safety standards and the best comfort possible
 to patients.  }}
