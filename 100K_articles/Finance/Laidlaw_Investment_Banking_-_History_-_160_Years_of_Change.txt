Article Body:
The Webster-Ashburton Treaty established the United States-Canada border east of the Rocky Mountains. John J. Greenough received a patent for the sewing machine paving the way for a boom in New York’s furnishings and apparel industry. Anesthesia, in the form of ether, was successfully used in an operation for the first time by Dr. Crawford Long, and would soon to come into widespread use during America’s Civil War. The British Empire, following on the Treaty of Nanking ending the First Opium War, annexed Hong Kong, which would one day become gateway to the world’s largest population center. The New York Curb Exchange, later to change its name to the American Stock Exchange, opened for business, trading in securities not qualified for listing on the New York Stock Exchange. And the original Laidlaw & Company was born.
