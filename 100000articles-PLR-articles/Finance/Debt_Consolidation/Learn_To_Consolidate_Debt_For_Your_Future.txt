It is never a bad idea to keep your future in mind when you are making decisions for today. In fact, I'd suggest that in certain areas of your life it is imperitive that you have a vision that is fixed more on the long term than on the immediate. Your financial situation is one of these areas that requires you to have long term eyes. It is a wise idea, both for now and for later, to learn to consolidate debt right now.

No one likes to talk about the need to consolidate debt. I guess it is because people are really comfortable in their debt and and so they do whatever it takes to avoid dealing with the grim realities of what their debt is doing to them. As a financial advisor, it is my joy and my privilege to work with clients every day and to help them see the need and the value of learning to consolidate debt.

Basically, learning to consolidate debt is just what it sounds. It is a process of getting an accurate picture of your current debt situation and then doing what you can to consolidate the debt into a lump sum each month so that you can pay the debt off quicker. Everyone who knows anything about money will tell you that the less debt you have, the better. So do not hesitate to meet with a financial advisor and look for ways to consolidate debt in your own budget.

The great thing about making a goal to consolidate debt now and in the years to come is that it will greatly pay off in your future. Who wants to still be paying off debts five, ten or twenty years down the road? No one I know. And that is why people need to get a big picture perspective when they are looking at their finances. Sure, you might really need that new car today, but what about if it affects you in a negative way for the next five or ten years? Do you still need that car today?

Learning to see with eyes into the future is a really important method of seeing the value of a decision to consolidate debt. If we are living in a false reality that isn't looking at or caring about the future than of course it will be hard for us to make long term decisions. This is a huge problem that needs to be fixed in our society. Much like eating unhealthy food for years on end will affect your health later, so building up debt without learning to consolidate debt will affect your financial health in the years to come.
