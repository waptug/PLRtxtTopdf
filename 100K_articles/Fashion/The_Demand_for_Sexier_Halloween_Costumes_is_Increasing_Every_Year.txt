Article Body:
The trend toward sexier Halloween costumes has been skyrocketing in recent years. These outfits have surpassed children's costumes in demand, leading companies to increase their stock of these types of outfits by leaps and bounds. Large buyers are also asking for more and more of these costumes.

Whether it's the influence of shows like "Sex and the City" or the convergence of fashion even on holidays, sexy costumes are all the rage for all ages. These outfits are showing more leg and midriff, and sexy versions of classic characters are emerging. In addition, while many customers will put a cap on what they are willing to spend on costumes, they will often go the extra mile for the accessories needed to put the finishing touches on an outfit, such as wigs, eyelashes, nails and jewelry.

Fashionable and sexy are overlapping in all walks of life, and Halloween is no exception. Increasingly, contemporary styles are being reflected in Halloween costumes, and higher-quality fabrics and embellishments are being used. Fashion-conscious shoppers want to wow other party goers rather than scare them, and they know exactly what they want to accomplish this trick. Halloween has become less a holiday to these shoppers than a reason for putting their style on display. Where Halloween once existed in its own realm, it is now an event that has become in sync with style trends.

An area that will expand this year and in coming years is the middle ground. Parents and children will always disagree on what is tasteful and not, and even adults occasionally are at odds with what they feel comfortable wearing. Some customers just wan	t to be flirty and playful, while others desire more revealing looks. The argument between what is too sexy and what is not sexy enough will linger, but companies are entering the fray by offering more costumes that lie somewhere in the middle.

The best news for customers is that, due to increased demand and competition among businesses that sell Halloween costumes, quality, creativity and choices are rising. The result is better and better costumes with more variety and size options-and the customer always wins in such situations.
