Safety in the Summer Sun

Precautions should be taken year-round to protect young skin from the harsh affects of 
the sun.  But this is especially important in the summertime when the sun is at its hottest.  
Aside from sunburns, heatstroke and dehydration are additional hazards to watch out for 
in young children.  But with a few safety steps and by planning ahead you can avoid 
sunburns and the like.

The best way to prevent sunburns, heatstroke and dehydration is to stay out of the sun.  
But that isn’t practical or very fun.  Buy sunscreen that is specifically made for children 
and be sure to apply it at least 30 minutes prior to going outside.  This gives the 
sunscreen time to work.  Once outside, reapply every two hours or more frequently if 
there is swimming or a sprinkler involved.  There are many products that can be 
purchased to make this easier from colored sunscreen that goes clear after it is absorbed 
by the skin to spray brands to make application easier.

Once outside, a hat is still important.  Ideally the hat will cover the face, ears and the 
back of the neck – all very sensitive body parts that are prone to getting burnt.  Wearing a 
hat will also protect you and the kids against heatstroke.  Have water available for each 
child when playing outside.  The combination of them running around and the hot sun 
can quickly dehydrate little bodies.

Staying out of the sun from 11:00 a.m. until after 2:00 p.m. is the best prevention.  This is 
the hottest time of the day and when the sun is at its peak.  By avoiding the outdoors at 
this time of day you can prevent sun related illnesses.  If this isn’t possible seek out some 
shade for the kids to take a break in.  Avoiding the sun isn’t the solution it is being smart 
when you are out in it.
