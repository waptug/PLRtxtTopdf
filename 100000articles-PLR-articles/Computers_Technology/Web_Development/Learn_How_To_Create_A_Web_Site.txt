Have you always wanted to learn how to create a web site? A web site is a great investment for a business, or a fun way to put yourself out there in the world and let your friends and family see what you’ve been up to. For a small business or individual family page, it may not be worth it to hire a professional to create a web site for you. After all, there are other services available. One option is to use a template style program, which allows you to choose a classic, easy on the eyes format and individualize it to build your own personal page or business platform. Web hosting companies often have services like this which are free with a hosting package.

There are many reasons people may want to claim their own corner of the Internet and create a web site:

    * A web page allows customers to find businesses more easily – many people look on the Internet first when they want to find a product or service, if only to research. They may then order it online, or go to the store with more confidence because they have already researched the product. This means a web page can often be an easy form of advertising – you can convey a lot more information to a customer than with a billboard or a flyer.

    * A family may want a way to keep connected across the country. This allows grandparents and other relatives an easy way to see pictures of junior, or friends to see what their buddies are up to.

    * Starting your business online can often be less expensive than opening a store. An Internet based business will often have lower costs – hosting a site versus renting a location is highly affordable.

It’s easy to create a web site. Using a hosting service, you can get your pages hosted on a server for a low monthly fee, and use a custom package make your site in a few simple steps. The only technical knowledge required will be pointing and clicking as you load on pictures and text. You will also receive extra conveniences such as email addresses to match your site.

A few good things to remember:

    * Choose a domain name that reflects something about your business. Your business name would be ideal, as long as it also includes some reference to what your business does. If your business’ name is Bob’s, you may want to add something to the name, such as Bobspancakes.com if you sell pancake mixes.

    * At the same time, do not be too specific. If your company grows, you may not want to change the name of your web site. If you think you might add to your company in the future, you might choose Bobsbreakfastmixes.com or Bobsmixes.com, to allow for growth.

    * Keep your pages easy to read. It can be tempting to add a lot of graphics and bits of video, but it may turn off potential customers if your pages take too long to load or are too distracting.
