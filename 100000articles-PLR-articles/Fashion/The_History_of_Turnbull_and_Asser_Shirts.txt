Article Body:
Turnbull and Asser, the world renowned menswear manufacturer, has won international recognition for its stylish well-tailored clothing. The brand is known especially for its classic bespoke shirts which are commonly associated with elegance and high quality. In fact, the production of custom shirts is the main company's trump card, making it lead the market of prestige clothing. Apart from that, Turnbull and Asser produces exquisite ties, formal wear, outwear, sleepwear, made-to-measure suits, jackets, cashmere clothing and all kinds of chic accessories, like gloves, cuff-links, hats, umbrellas and leather goods.

Established in 1885 by Reginald Turnbull and Ernest Asserand, the company started with hosiery and opened its first shop under the name of “John Arthur Turnbull”. As Turnbull and Asser had a favorable location, adjoining elite gentlemen's clubs, the shop quickly gained popularity among noble clientele.

Since 1903 Turnbull and Asser flagship has been situated on Jermyn Street, London; however, the company also has two American stores, in Beverly Hills and New York City.

The current owner of Turnbull and Asser is Ali al-Fayed who renewed the Jermyn Street store and founded two branches in the USA.

Though traditionally Turnbull and Asser manufactured menswear, nowadays it offers clothing for ladies as well. Thus, T&A clients include the famous actress Gwyneth Paltrow, as well as many other celebrities.

Turnbull and Asser clothing, and especially its bespoke shirts, are distinguished by classic, yet very bold and fashion-conscious design, vivid colours and high-end fabrics, most of which are woven in Italy. Shirts come in various sizes and styles, and even if a man can't find anything to his taste, made-to-measure shirts are available. Personal service has made Turnbull and Asser an unsurpassed shirt manufacturer, leaving behind other competitors. Although the store doesn't feature low prices, the number of buyers is constantly increasing. Regular clients of the Jermyn Street store admit that products are characterized by considerable longevity, and, having purchased a custom shirt, one can wear it for years without looking unfashionable.

Almost from the very beginning Turnbull and Asser served royalty, politicians and celebrities, selling gorgeous custom shirts to Sir Winston Churchill, Ronald Reagan, the Prince of Wales, Sean Penn, Ben Stiller and other famous people. Perhaps, the best experience from the point of view of Turnbull and Asser's promotion was its collaboration with the 007 series. Bonds of different generations, from Sean Connery to Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig, sported elegant cotton Turnbull and Asser bespoke shirts while they were saving the humanity from all kinds of disasters. Actually Ian Fleming was a T&A fan himself…
