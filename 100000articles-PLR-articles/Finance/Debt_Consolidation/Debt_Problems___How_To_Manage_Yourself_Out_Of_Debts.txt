Well, you are not alone. Many people face a financial crisis in some part of their lives. Whether the crisis is self created (over spending) or by accident (family illness, or loss of a job), it can be prevail over. Your financial health can only improve if you put your heart and soul into nursing it.

The first step to manage yourself get out of debts is to develop a budget plan. Take some time to think over and do a realistic assessment of how much you earn and spend each month.

List your expenses into fixed and variable and identify which are ‘needs’ spending that you cannot live without (for example food and house mortgage), and ‘wants’ spending that you can survive without spending.

Get a good idea of how much you need to spend on your fixed and ‘needs’ spending and always leave enough money for them. The goal is to make sure you can make ends meet on your basics needs: housing, food, health care, insurance, and education. And reduce your ‘wants’ expenses as far as possible.

If you have creditors, contact them immediately to tell them frankly that you are in financial difficulties. Ask them to work out a payment plan that you can manage so that you can still pay them. You’ll be surprise that most of your creditors are wiling to negotiate and work out a better repayment plan for you.

Manage your secured debts especially your auto loan. Lenders have the right to repossess your car if you default on your payment. Instead of waiting for your car to be repossessed and paying extra fees. Talk to your lender and ask if you can sell or trade in your car for a cheaper one. Alternately, ask for grace period so that you can save on the added costs of repossession and a negative entry on your credit report.
