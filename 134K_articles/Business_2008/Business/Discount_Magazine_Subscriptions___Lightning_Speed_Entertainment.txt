Article Body:
If you are an avid reader and like to be updated about all things happening around you and in the world, magazines are the way to go. They provide rapid education on topics which might not be your main knowledge area and provide you the latest updates on them. Over a period of time, you are sure to develop a set of magazines which you like to read and thus it is best that you take up a discount magazine subscription. 

Discount magazine subscriptions are not only helpful is helping you save a bit of cash on the cost of the magazines; they are also good to get you some free stuff. If you like Good Housekeeping, you are obviously a homemaker and you can be rest assured that a nice set of jars await you with the next subscription. Similarly, if you are a geek and swear by Computers Today, then you can expect a nice set of goodies in the free software CD which comes with the subscription. 

Apart from the free stuff (which of course is a big carrot for people like me who fall for anything which has the four letter word on it …I mean FREE) magazine subscriptions also have a few other benefits. Firstly, the magazines are delivered right up to your door step within a couple of days from the time they get published. This ensures that you get the latest magazines in the shortest possible time. Home delivery is one of the best benefits of discount magazine subscriptions and you realize it even more when the newsstand is a not very close to your house. 

Thus the next time you see yourself picking up the same magazine three times in a row, take out the leaflet in the middle and subscribe to the magazine!
