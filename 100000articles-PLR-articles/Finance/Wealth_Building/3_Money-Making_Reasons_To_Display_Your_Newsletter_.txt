If you write articles for your website, try not to include the affiliate links in the body of your articles: it will give the impression that you have a vested interest in recommending them. You want your visitors to trust your advice, so don't turn your article into an excuse to promote products and make a commission.

Other ways to get your website noticed are to use article promotion and link exchanges. With link exchanges, you would ad text or graphic links of other related sites onto your site, and they would ad your site information onto their site. This will get your site noticed by more people and will improve your search engine ratings.

3 Money-Making Reasons to Display Your Newsletter on Your Website

Seeing is believing. Unless your website visitors can experience your newsletter and appreciate its value, they’re unlikely to join your opt-in, email list. By posting your newsletter on your website, you encourage more visitors to subscribe and you drive more profitable traffic to your website each month.

- Growing your opt-in email list is one of your most important goals. Your success depends on encouraging a high percentage of website visitors to provide their email addresses and permission to contact them for free via email. Most websites expect visitors to opt-in to email lists without first providing an opportunity for visitors to ‘test drive’ the newsletter. This is like wearing a blindfold when shopping for a car! Thumbnails, reduced size images of newsletters, are not the answer. Visitors are not able to read the value of its information before signing up. As a result, only a small portion of website visitors subscribe and - of those that do – many quickly unsubscribe.

- Your second biggest goal is to monetize your educational One-Page Newsletter by generating immediate sales. For the first time, you can display your newsletter in the context of other text and graphic elements on a web page. Next to your newsletter, for example, you can display links to promotional coupons or links to special offers described on other pages of your website. This is important because fewer and fewer firms are distributing formatted newsletters as email attachments. Instead, they are driving traffic to their website each month by sending short emails announcing the page on their website where they have posted the latest issue. You can now easily convert this traffic into sales!

So many people have hopes and aspirations outside of their cubicles, but they seldom have the chance to explore these avenues because work and family commitments clash to severely leave any extra time for themselves.

- The third money-making reason for displaying your newsletter on your website is higher readership. More visitors to your website will likely read your newsletter because they don’t have to first download it. This leads to more sign-ups. The more attractive and informative your newsletter, the more likely visitors will sign-up to receive it. You can prove the consistent high value of your newsletter by adding descriptive links to earlier issues.
