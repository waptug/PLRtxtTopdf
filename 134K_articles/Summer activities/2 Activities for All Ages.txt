Activities for All Ages

If you have children that are not very close in age or run a daycare with a wide range of 
ages it can be tricky to plan activities that will engage everyone.  But it is not impossible.  
There are activities that can be planned that everyone can participate in at their own level 
or ones where the older children can help the younger.  Don’t despair about the age gap 
or feel that you need to plan something different for everyone.  Follow the tips below as a 
guide or starting point to including everyone in your summertime activities.

Indoor or outdoor crafts are perfect for kids of all ages.  Provide the materials and general 
instructions and see the different masterpieces that will be created.  When making crafts 
keep in mind that the instructions are more of a starting point.  Let kids use their 
imagination to make it all their own.  You will be pleased with the results when fewer 
parameters are put on a child’s imagination when creating artwork or other hands-on 
crafts. 

Old-fashioned games of hide-and-seek or tag are games that children of all ages will 
enjoy.  The added benefit of the physical activity will run of some of the abundant energy 
children possess.  By participating yourself you can fit in your own exercise for the day 
too.

Let older children help facilitate the summer activities that you plan.  By engaging the 
older children to help the younger they will feel a sense of responsibility and importance.  
This is a summer activity in itself, teaching leadership to children will help in many 
aspects of their lives.

When the situation warrants it, let the older and younger children do their own things.  
But don’t feel that you can’t combine the activities too, it is easier for you and great for 
the kids.
