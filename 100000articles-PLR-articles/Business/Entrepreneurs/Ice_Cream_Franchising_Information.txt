Everyone loves ice cream. Ask anyone what type of ice cream they like best and you will listen to a lot of interesting answers and some great stories too. For longer than anyone alive can remember People in America have been eating this simple treat through good times and bad. During rich times and poor times people will look for ways to find great tasting ice cream. While driving by any ice cream shop you will notice that there are more folks wanting ice cream than there are franchises. When there is a demand for a product at this level it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that owning an icecream franchise can be the best decision you will ever make.

Around the turn of the 20th century the ice cream soda was a favorite with teenagers. In some communities the fun snack was considered to be sinful and in a few places it was even prohibited on the Sabbath. Once cheap refrigerators grew to be standard in businesses in the second part, ice cream started to spread all around the world. Ice cream took off even more when the Baskin Robbins franchise introduced ice cream to the world. Enourmous growth was again experienced in the frozen treat market because the amount of air was upped and this made the first soft ice cream, forever changing the way the dessert was enjoyed. After the rise of soft ice cream everthing was in place for the ice cream franchise explosion.

One of the very first frozen treat franchising opportunities was the Carvel franchise. Tom Carvel at first sold ice cream from a broken down truck in the late 1920s and in the late 1940s created the first retail fun food ice cream store franchise in the U.S.,. This only started the craze and the ice cream franchise industry kept going long after Carvel had started. As a matter of fact, it has grown to be one of the most popular franchise opportunity industries in the mass collection of franchises.

Even though this can be fun there are some things to consider when investing in a franchise or starting a business. A common mistake a lot of investors make is to get frantic and to rush. You must know a lot about the market you would like to own and then it is very important that you follow the necessary steps to business ownership.

If you study the industry you will see that some business models like restaurant franchises are always busy in all places, but a few franchises can do better at different times of the year. Of course, this does not mean that ice cream franchise opportunities don’t do well all year round in some climates, but these franchises might not make as much money in friged places up north but in the southern states they may never experience a lull in business. One option for owners in cold climates is to open their ice cream shop franchise in spots like malls where people are protected from bad weather so the patrons can enjoy the frosty treat all winter.
