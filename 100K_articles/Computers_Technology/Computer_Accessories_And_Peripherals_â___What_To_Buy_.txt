Whether you have a desktop, or a laptop, you need various computer accessories and peripherals to derive the maximum benefit from them and also optimize their use. There are quite a lot of accessories available in the market today, and new ones are making their entry on a day-to-day basis.

In most of the cases these accessories and peripherals are available with your computer, but if they aren't then, they are available at all computer shops. Some of the special items in this regard, will not be available with your computer, but can be bought from exclusive vendors. 

The different types of computer accessories and peripherals

The keyboard

Everyone knows what a keyboard looks like and its functionality. All computers come with their own keyboard, and you don't have to buy them separately. However, there does come a time, when you find that they don't suit you or they do not have the features that you are looking for.

Its arguably one of the most important of all computer accessories and its primary activity is to input data. The amount of choices available in terms of keyboards and their functionality is enormous. 

These days you also get a wireless keyboard, and even a keyboard that is ergonomic in nature. Ergonomic keyboards are a great buy for people who spend a lot of time typing. They prevent strain resulting from the same.

The mouse

Though you can control your computer without the use of your mouse, it's still much easier and comfortable to do so, using the mouse. All operating systems, that are available today, are configured to work with the use of a mouse.

Mouse, as an accessory, is an overriding necessity and you simply can't do without it. It is available in a variety of designs, and are configured to suit various requirements of the user. 

There are various types of mouse available in the market. The most affordable out of all this variety is the simple mouse that contains a ball underneath, which helps in the movement of the cursor. Other expensive varieties include the optical mouse and the wireless mouse.

The printer

Printers cannot be called a necessity in terms of computer accessories and peripherals, but are required if you want to print material on a regular basis. However, they are a helpful addition to all computer systems. 

The market is replete with numerous options, when it comes to printers. Today, buying printers is not difficult or even expensive. You can go for the black and white variety or opt for a color printer. Laser printers are the most expensive of the lot, but in the long run, help save a lot of money.

The scanner

Again, like the printers, it's not a primary requirement when it comes to a computer system. A scanner, basically, helps you scan various images, and documents onto your computer.

After you get them on your computers, you can edit them and even print them. The purpose of a scanner is to make a graphic image of your document and save them into your computers.

Scanners are not cheap, but to call them expensive wouldn't be right either. Today, you can buy a combination that includes both a scanner and a printer. Such models can be a good buy. 

The speakers

All computers come with their own sound cards, which enable you to hear sound played from your computer. This can be done using a set of speakers that are reliable and give out good sound. 

You can buy a host of speakers, dependant on size, price, design, and style. Sophisticated speakers are expensive, but are recommended if you are going to use your computer to watch DVD films or play computer games.

Web cam

Web cameras are the miniature version of regular cameras and their images can be accessed using the services of the World Wide Web. These web cameras are a combination of digital cameras, with a capability to upload all images on a particular web server.

These cameras are attached to a PC, enabling people to see each other, when they chat or do video conferencing. 

Flash drive

A flash drive is essentially a storage device. It's called a flash drive, because it uses a flash memory rather than the traditional methods of data storage.

Many a times, they are used as a replacement for hard drives, and most of the times, their functionality, size, shape, and even user interface is similar to these hard drives.

Pen Drive or USB Flash Drive

These drives are integrated with a Universal Serial Bus or USB connector, and are generally small, removable, rewritable, and lightweight. They are the new age replacements for traditional data storage accessories like floppy disks or even data CD’s.

They are able to store more data, are easy to use, and are inherently more reliable. 

There are many more computer accessories and peripherals that are available in the market. Such accessories have exclusive uses and are only used for specific purpose. The ones listed above are the ones that are commonly used.
