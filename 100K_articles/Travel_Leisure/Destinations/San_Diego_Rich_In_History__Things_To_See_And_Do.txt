**Follow the Founders' Trail to relive the early history of San Diego

The Founders' Trail consists of seven historic sites in the San Diego area where you can learn about the early history of the area.

The earliest inhabitants of the San Diego area were Native Americans. Mission Trails Regional Park includes 3000 acres of countryside preserved much as it was when the Kumeyaay people hunted and harvested here hundreds of years ago.

The Cabrillo National Monument marks the place where Juan Rodriguez stepped ashore in 1542 and claimed the region for Spain.

It wasn't until 225 years later in 1769 that the first Franciscan missions were established in the area. Junipero Serra Museum, Mission San Diego de Alcala, and Mission San Luis Rey all display this era in the development of the San Diego area.

The Mexican era began in 1821 when Mexico won its independence from Spain. This was the beginning of the era of giant ranches displayed at Rancho de los Pinasquitos and Rancho de Guajome.

The Mexican era ended in 1848 after the two year war between Mexico and the United States and the California territory was transferred to the U.S. Revisit this era in local history at the visitor center at San Pasqual, the site of the only major battle of the war fought in the San Diego area.

**San Diego to host World Baseball Classic Finals

The first ever World Baseball Classic is set to begin on March 3, 2006. Sixteen countries or territories are committed to the event. It begins March 3 in Japan's Tokyo Dome and will end with an inaugural champion crowned on March 20 in San Diego's PETCO Park.

Those teams so far confirmed have been divided into four pools for the first round. They include: Pool A -- China, Chinese Taipei, Japan, Korea; Pool B -- Canada, Mexico, South Africa, U.S.; Pool C -- Netherlands, Panama, Puerto Rico and possibly Cuba; Pool D -- Australia, Dominican Republic, Italy, Venezuela.

The two big "maybes" for the tournament are the team from Cuba and Alex Rogriguez. The Cuban team has been told by the U.S. Treasury Department that it cannot participate because of U.S. laws governing financial transactions with Cuba. Rodriguez has said he will likely not participate because of divided loyalties between his birthplace (Dominican Republic) and his adopted home (U.S.) Both issues are the subject of much speculation and are currently being negotiated.

San Diego Beach Scene - Visit San Diego's beaches for a wide range of experiences. The Continental Shelf extends many miles offshore, protecting the area from localized North Pacific storms and swelss from the Southern Ocean. The temperate climate makes San Diego's many beaches safe and pleasant all year-round. Three distinct beach areas offer variety of experience and scenery. The North County coast features sandstone bluffs and fine beaches from Torrey Pines to San Onofre. The Central Coast is marked by dramatic headlands at La Jolla and Point Loma with the impressive waterways of Mission Bay in between. In the South Bay, the beaches of Coronado and the Silver Strand make San Diego one of the world's great seaports.
