\'92s can be fun, but they can also be dangerous. They are notorious for causing
 injuries and even death, but with the proper safety precautions your chances of
 injury can be reduced. ATV\u8217\'92s are powerful machines that are designed to
 traverse difficult terrain. They can de difficult to handle and the nature of the
 riding you can do is dangerous in itself. If you want to stay safe while riding
, there are some general safety tips you should follow.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Having experience
 is the best way to ensure you drive safely. Before you buy your first ATV, make
 sure you become acquainted with their operation and try one out if possible. There
 is a wealth of information online about how to properly handle an ATV and proper
 driving techniques. You should also study the owner\u8217\'92s manual to get insight
 on how to safely drive your ATV. \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 After you
 purchase your ATV you should drive with others that are experienced and observe
 safe driving techniques. The best way to learn how to navigate rough terrain with
 your ATV is to watch experienced riders navigate. You should begin your ATV hobby
 by riding on easy, level terrain so that you can get acquainted with your ATV. 
Taking a training class is also a good way to learn how to safely operate your ATV
. Some states require minors to take safety classes prior to being able to ride 
and they are a good idea for everyone.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 No matter
 how experienced a rider you are, you will inevitably take a few falls. The best
 way to protect yourself is to wear safety gear at all times. A helmet is a must
 along with gloves and goggles. You should also wear pants and a jacket that are
 designed for riding and durable. They will protect your arms and legs from abrasions
 and not tear as easily as normal clothes. Many injures occur because riders do 
not wear proper safety gear and these injuries could be avoided if riders wear safety
 gear. Make sure your helmet fits properly and if you do take a serious fall you
 should replace it if it takes impact.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Another way
 to stay safe when riding an ATV is to make sure you can handle your machine. Larger
 more powerful ATV\u8217\'92s can be hard to handle and you need to make sure that
 you can control the ATV you choose. If you have a hard time controlling a large
 ATV, you can always get a smaller one that will be easier to manage. Make sure 
you get plenty of practice and are comfortable with your ATV before you tackle tough
 terrain.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Another safety
 precaution that seems obvious but causes many injuries is driving under the influence
 of alcohol. Never operate an ATV if you have been drinking, you can endanger your
 life and the life of others. ATV\u8217\'92s take skill and precaution to operate
 safely and all ATV owners should follow safety rules. Proper safety equipment and
 experience will go a long way to keep you safe while on your ATV.  \par}
