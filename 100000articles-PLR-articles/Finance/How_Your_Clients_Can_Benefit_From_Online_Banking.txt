These days, customer service representatives have got it easy. Why? Because computers are taking over their responsibilities. More and more, people are using home computers for everyday tasks, from ordering gifts and groceries to making appointments and dates to booking movie and travel tickets. It is no wonder then that online banking is becoming increasingly popular. Even smaller banks are recognizing the benefits of online services.

There are numerous perks to online banking. For example:

- Say goodbye long lines! Instead, customers can manage accounts on their own time from the comfort of their own home.
- No need for customers to worry about organizing bank statements or filing canceled checks! They can list their latest transactions online in a tidy manner.
- No more waiting for payments to clear or statements to come in the mail. All accounts are continually updated online.

Still not sold on the idea?

How about if your customers could pay all their utility bills and credit card bills without ever leaving their home or buying a stamp? What if they could set up automatic payments that would be sent out on a pre-arranged date?

All your customers need to do is carve out a little bit of time (probably no more than thirty minutes) to get their information online. Then, before they know it, they are paying bills with just the click of a mouse. In a flash, they have done away stamps, envelopes, and trips to the post office. What’s more, they have created a valuable online record of all their payments that they can access at any time of any day.

Be prepared for your clients to ask for help when they are setting up their online banking system. Most bank branches have financial officers who are delighted to walk clients through this initial process. They will assist in setting up accounts, listing the addresses, amounts of payments, dates of payments etc. And trust us, after customers log on to do their banking for the first time, they will be hooked. It really is that easy and convenient.

But besides convenience, online banking offers some perks that one can’t get the old-fashioned way. Let’s say you have a customer who wants to create a budget for the next three years. Online banking programs can do this! And, down the line, if a customer wishes to tweak a budget, all they have to do is log on and type in the changes.

One thing to keep in mind is that banking customers will probably have questions about the safety of online banking systems. It will be the banks’ job to calm these concerns and explain that the information is encrypted and no one else can access the individual accounts.

And if all of this is not enough, customers will also be pleased to know that they will save money by banking online because they will not have to buy stamps or envelopes or any more paper checks!

Online banking is a win-win situation. Banks can attract new customers by offering new electronic options, and customers will be instantly pleased with the results. Today, people want to feel in control of their money. By offering clients an online banking system, you are also offering them a much needed sense of power and peace.
