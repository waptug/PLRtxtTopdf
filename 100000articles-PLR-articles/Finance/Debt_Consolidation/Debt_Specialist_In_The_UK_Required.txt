We are always hearing in the media how the country is in debt and that many people are also in severe debt but most people think that they have their own debts under control.

I had a friend who himself had a number of credit cards and was very happy to use them, seemingly not phased that at some point in the future he would have to repay the money etc. He lived for today and was determined not to miss out on any holiday or night out. I was confused at how he could afford all of the things he bought as I was aware of how much he roughly earned.

I was particularly surprised when he bought a very impressive, however expensive car. He told me he had taken out a car loan over three years to pay for it. Maybe it was just me but I could not believe his attitude to money and even tried to suggest that maybe he should be a bit more careful with his money.

He did not listen to me and could not understand why I was so careful with money and why I wanted to drive around in my old banger as he called it.

He went on this huge spending spree for around three years. Suddenly he was stopped in his tracks as unfortunately he lost his job. His earnings now stopped but the repayments did not. He became further and further in debt and eventually needed to seek help.

He decided to look for a debt specialist in the UK and it took him along time to get himself straight.
