Article Body:
China’s Chery Automotive Group is getting set to import as many as five vehicles into the US starting in the summer of 2007. These 2008 models are reportedly going to be cheaper than competing models in their respective classes, undercutting some models by as much as $10,000 per car. I have been doing a little investigating and have learned more about the Chery QQ, the three door compact that will retail for just $6995. Hold onto your hats as I read off the long list of standard features for its incredible, low price.

Just when you think you have seen everything, along comes the QQ. Reportedly, QQ stands for Quality and Quick as the car is made from remnants of destroyed Soviet tanks that battled with China during a protracted border skirmish in 1970. In addition, the car zips from 0 to 48 before the engine craps out. Oh, well zero to sixty would have been nice, but alas...

<b>Standard features for the QQ will include: </b>

<li>Seats, front and rear

<li>Seatbelts with air bags

<li>Glass, all around as needed

<li>Steering Wheel with horn

<li>Dashboard

<li>Removable Ashtray

<li>Window Regulators {4}

<li>Rubber Gaskets

<li>Plastic Molding

<li>Polyester Tires {4}

<li>Hubcaps with lug nuts

<li>Door Handles with driver and front passenger keyholes

<li>Antenna

<li>Truck Key with Keyhole

<li>Headlights

<li>Tail lights

<li>Turn signals

<li>Brakes

<li>Shocks

<li>Bumpers

Doors, hood, trunk and roof are all standard; body side moldings will likely be extra. Engine, transmission, radiator, exhaust, and countless other parts will also be included once they are removed from junked Yugos and retrofitted for the QQ.

Optional equipment will likely include a radio, comfortable seats, air conditioning, and perhaps even a rear window defroster. Oh, by the way, General Motors has sued and won a judgment against Chery declaring that the “Chery” name sounds too close to their Chevy name. Chery has agreed and will likely adopt the Forg name for all cars imported to the US. Stay tuned!
