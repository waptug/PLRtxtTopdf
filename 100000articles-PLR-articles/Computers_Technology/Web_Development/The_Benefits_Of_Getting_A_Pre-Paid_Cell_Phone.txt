For individuals whose jobs require them to work in various locations from time to time, it can be a good idea to use a pre-paid cell phone. These kinds of phones are usually less expensive and more convenient for short term needs.

If your job takes you to several different parts of the country or even the different parts of the world and you need to have phone communications in those locations for several days or weeks, you will find that it is much easier to purchase a pre-paid cell phone instead of taking your regular cell phone with you on your travels.

This is especially true when you consider long distance calls and roaming charges. Pre-paid cell phones are particularly convenient in that they are ready to use from the minute they are purchased. You can go to any one of the many dealerships that represent the numerous cell phone companies and check out what products they have available.

Compare prices, and when you find the one that suits you best, you can buy it right off the shelf. You don't need anything other than a valid drivers license to purchase a pre-paid cell phone in most cases. You can use the phone as soon as you turn it on, which makes it simple to communicate with your local business contacts. And no one has to use his or her expensive airtime to call you, since your pre-paid cell phone makes you a locally available resource.

Your business headquarters will appreciate the cost-effectiveness of a pre-paid cell phone as well. There are no monthly subscription charges to pay, no additional fees or unused balances, and you can limit the usage on the pre-paid phone to get the most value from it. If you know you will be in a particular location for a short time, you can load the phone with a lower amount; if you're going to be there longer, you just add more money.

Of course, there are some drawbacks to using a pre-paid cell phone. For example, they are not especially affordable to use for extended periods. Because they are pre-paid, the per-minute charges are usually much higher than you would pay under long term plans. But if they are used appropriately and carefully, you can get more from your pre-paid cell phone than from a traditional connection.

Of course they don't always work out for everyone but if possible give pre-paid cell phones a try and see how they work for you.
