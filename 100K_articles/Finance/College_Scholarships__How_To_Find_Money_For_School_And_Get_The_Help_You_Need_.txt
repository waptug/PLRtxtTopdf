Many potential college students don't end up attending university due to a lack of money, however there are thousands of college scholarship programs available. Here is a list of the most common types of college scholarships that students can apply for:

• Private organisations
• Corporate awards
• College-specific awards
• Athletic award
• Union funded scholarship
• Military scholarship
• Academic scholarship
• Departmental awards

College scholarships awarded by the college that a student is attending are subject to strict terms of acceptance. This type of college scholarship is constantly re-evaluated throughout the length of the course that the student is funded for and can be withdrawn if the student fails to keep to the agreed terms.

An athletic scholarship is fairly self-explanatory but this type of college scholarship is probably the hardest for a student to obtain. There are hundreds of thousands of highly gifted athletes from a range of sports every year that apply for an athletic college scholarship and the numbers awarded are extremely low. It is worth bearing in mind that only the top flight schools will offer an athletic college scholarship.

The academic scholarships are one of the few that do not actually require the student to apply for them. This is because the college normally awards an academic scholarship based on the college application alone. Obviously, the very nature of an academic scholarship means that a student will require outstanding academic potential to be offered a full academic college scholarship and it is more common for a particle college scholarship to be awarded.

A departmental scholarship is most commonly awarded by a specific department of a college to either attract or retain students for courses run by that particular department. The individual department will provide information as to whether they offer any type of special scholarship or not.

There are many private organisations that offer some form of partial college scholarship. These often depend on the area that a student lives in but national organisations may also offer a student a college scholarship but the competition for these can be fierce.

On the other hand, many corporations actually have a college scholarship program but fail to award them because of a lack of applicants. The corporations may offer a college scholarship to students to attract them into the particular line of work that the corporation is in or simply to offer students in their community the chance to attend college.

Unions have a large amount of money allocated to a college scholarship fund. These are usually aimed at students who are going to enter a field of study related to the type of union.

Finally, the various branches of the military all have an extensive college scholarship program. A military college scholarship is often extremely generous but is awarded in exchange for a pre-agreed length of service after graduation in the particular branch that sponsored the student.
