If you've always dreamed of earning a part-time or full-time income online from your home, gifting might be the solution. Gifting offers a tremendous opportunity to work from home, reduce your taxable income, and gain wealth for your future. Through gifting, many Web entrepreneurs are discovering benefits they didn't realize were theirs.

Gifting Explained

Gifting is a unique home based opportunity in which no company is involved, there are no payroll checks, and there are no overhead expenses. It relies on the "act of giving" and the reap-and-sow concept - giving results in receiving. Gifting is beneficial to everyone because gifts within certain monetary value limits as set forth by the government are considered tax-free. These gifts come directly off the top of your income, thus, decreasing your taxable income and possibly your tax bracket.

The beauty of gifting is you can give and receive as many gifts as you want all the while helping others to become a giver and receiver. There are many ways to give gifts and benefit from giving on your taxes. Some acceptable gifts are monetary gifts, real estate gifts, mutual funds, gifts in kind, life insurance gifts, income gifts for heirs, charitable donations, and retirement assets. Churches, charity organizations, companies, and even royal families have been benefiting from giving for years. There are even medical insurance alternatives called medical share programs in which participants send money as gifts to individuals according to monthly medical needs. But many individuals don't realize they can benefit too, even if they don't own a business or charitable organization.

Giving and Receiving for Income

To establish a full-time or part-time income, there are home based gifting opportunities that act as a liaison between the parties on both the giving and receiving end. The givers and receivers all benefit by recommending others, but unlike pyramids or network marketing plans, those who are recommended are not on bottom levels trying to work their way up. Also, there is no selling involved. Web resources, videos, and other avenues make explaining the process easy. And unlike most business opportunities, there are no products or services to sell. Everyone gives and receives the same gifts, so everyone benefits.

Benefits of Gifting

Gifting is growing in popularity as a home based opportunity for several reasons. The benefits of giving are not commonly known to the general public; therefore, there's a good opportunity to educate others about gifting and its many rewards. Also, there are many others online who would like to share in a gifting opportunity but aren't sure how or who to trust. This allows new gifters to introduce many people to the concept without a lot of advertising.

Another benefit is anyone can participate in gift giving from their home, enjoy freedom from a 9-to-5 job, and spend more time with their family. Gifting also brings many interesting people together to form lifelong friendships. Everyone involved has a sense of giving back to the online community while also enjoying the benefits of receiving extra income for enjoyment, bills, retirement, college tuition, savings, and other financial needs.

Gifting allows many people to stay at home while building tremendous wealth. The gifting income levels vary from one individual to another, with some earning thousands of dollars each month. For those who realize success through gifting, the "joy of giving" becomes much more joyful!
