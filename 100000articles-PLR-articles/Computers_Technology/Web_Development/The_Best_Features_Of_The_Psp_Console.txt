The Amazing Features the PSP Brings With It

The amazing thing about the PSP is that even with all of the technology, graphics and great features that come with it, it is still small and light, weighing less than a pound. This makes it absolutely ideal to carry around with you!

The PSP has been designed for the serious and devoted gamers and it has an excellent range of features, making it a brilliant purchase for anyone with a media oriented mind. It is not only cutting edge for gaming, it is also a hand held video player and music device, too. This makes it so much more than a simple console – it is a revolutionary entertainment device!

The battery life is generally three to six hours, but the average tends to be more like four hours. Also, it has built-in stereo speakers in order to give you that extraordinary gaming experience. No game would be the same without great sound effects and boy does it sound great with the PSP.

The console itself comes readily equipped with its own usb2.0 port, an infrared port and even a memory stick pro duo slot. It also gives the user a wireless LAN connection. Another great feature is the 4.3-inch display screen and the buttons are laid out exactly like they are on the Playstation controllers, which makes it easier to learn how to play.

The UMD drive is situated at the back of the PSP. With this, you can view movies designed by Sony on a disk with the UMD format. This hand held gaming device is designed to be able to go anywhere, whether it is for a very long drive, a plane journey or whether you just want to play it at home. Having this will really get you through those boring times!

To customize your PSP, you can always change the background color and you can even have it set to change automatically each month. You can also have your favorite wallpapers on your PSP, too. So it is definitely one of the best consoles for personalization.

Not only is the PSP a great multifunctional entertainment device, it is stunning to look at as well. You get so much for your money and it can be carried around wherever you go. What more could you ask for from a game console?
