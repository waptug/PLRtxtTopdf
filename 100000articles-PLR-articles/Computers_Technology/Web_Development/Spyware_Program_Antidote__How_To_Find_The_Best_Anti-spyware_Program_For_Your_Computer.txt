In other words, spyware programs are specifically designed to steal information from your computer. In this information age, such a program could potentially cause major damage to you.

If you remember what happened to Sandra Bullock's character in the movie The Net, where somebody else stole her identity just by using a computer program, then completely erased all her records, then you have an idea of what could happen if a spyware program embeds itself into your hard disk. Of course, this is a rather extreme situation, but you get the idea.

Fortunately, there is a way to eliminate any spyware programs from your computer. You can do this by using an effective anti-spyware program. The anti-spyware program will not only remove any spyware lurking inside your hard disk, but it will also protect your system from being infiltrated again in the future.

Which now brings us to the most important part…how to find the best anti-spyware program for your computer. If you make a search on Google, you will find that there are probably hundreds of anti-spyware programs available right now. So how do you figure out which one will most effectively protect your system?

There are three main features that you have to look out for. First of all, a good anti-spyware program has an extensive list of spyware types. It would have to be able to recognize any kind of spyware program that tries to enter your system. Most anti-spyware programs regularly update their spyware database, so you would also have to regularly upgrade your anti-spyware program.

The second important thing that a good anti-spyware program should be capable of is cleaning infected files. Spyware sometimes contaminates your system files, and restoring them is essential to maintain the performance of your computer system.

Finally, you can see if an anti-spyware program is good if there is adequate customer support provided by the software company. Upgrades must be provided regularly so you can be sure that your computer is always protected from malicious software.

These three features are the most important criteria to look at when selecting an anti-spyware program for your computer. Other factors such as price would only be secondary, if you think about how important it is to keep your system secure at all times.
