You’ve decided it’s time to buy a digital camera, but which one? The aisles are full of different brands with different features and a wide variety of prices to match. The task can be overwhelming. Following are the three most important things you can do to make the decision easier.:

Do your research. Talk to people who have digital cameras and ask them how they like theirs. What features do they use often and which ones are “just there”? Go online and visit sites that review different cameras and read what they have to say.

Next, decide how much money you are willing to spend on a camera. There is no sense going into debt over a camera unless it will be used as your major income source. Decide how often you will use the camera, what places you will be using it and who else will be using this particular camera. How much money can you reasonably spare? All these things will help you narrow your choices.

Evaluate your needs and experience level. Do you have experience or is this your very first camera? Do you have time to learn a lot of features or are you happy with a camera you can just point and click? Do you plan on growing in photography? If so, a digital SLR may be your choice so it can be added onto to grow with you.

Buying a digital camera doesn’t have to be a purchase full of stress. Do your homework and know what you are looking for, then stick with the decision. You are the best judge of what you need, trust yourself. Each of the above steps will narrow your choices considerably and make that final decision easier to make and you can enjoy discovering the wonders of photography with your new purchase.
