You must be aware of the fact that everyday your computer is at risk to almost all the computer disasters available. Whether you are using Mac or a Personal Computer, viruses, hackers, power surges, natural disasters, human errors, hardware failures and many threats can be encountered. For you to keep your data in a safe, you will need to do a back up on your hard drives. However, when hard drive failure takes place, your only solution is data recovery.

Ideally, you need to back up data to keep your files safe and sound. It is also done to avoid the use of complicated process like data recovery. But if you run into steps to prepare your computer from hard drive problems, you might find it hard and experience problems.

Make Sure That You Know The Meaning of Data Recovery:

If you are working diligently away on a document or spreadsheet in Microsoft Office and the power goes out, you may still be able to recover the documents you were working on when the lights come back on. This type of data recovery is relatively easy and straightforward. Software manufacturers recognize that power outages are inevitable and unpredictable and most office applications incorporate what is known as auto save features.

At set intervals, the documents you have open are saved to a cached file. They remain in that cached state and should be accessible once your power is restored. Simply opening Microsoft Word or Excel will usually bring these documents back. For instance, when you open Word after a power failure or a software error, you will be presented with a document followed by the word recovered in parentheses. This is the document you were working on at the most recent auto save point. You may still lose a couple minutes worth of work this way, but it sure beats having to go back and retype the entire document.

If the recovered document does not appear automatically, search your hard drive for files ending with tamp. Look for one created close to the time of the power failure or software error and open it. This is most likely the document you had open at the time. If this method of data recovery does not work, you may need to follow the steps listed below.

Try to Call an Expert:

If some programs in your computer do not function well, turn your computer system off. This is a very easy task but you need to do it. This can prevent damages on the disks and avoids data loss. If you will notice an unusual sound, the process is already taking place. The moment you notice that your hard drives are working overtime, you need to turn your computer system off to avoid your computer to self-destruct. If you will not do this simple task, you have your computer system damaged.

There is also a do-it-yourself software for data recovery. However, you have to be careful in choosing which one is for you. Most of the self instructed data recovery software are very complicated and are dangerous by nature. This can ruin the function of your computer instead of treating it. If someone boast about the effectiveness of their data recovery self instruction, be able to know how to handle it properly. Read carefully the instruction and do it well.
