Balloon Wars

In the winter everyone loves a good snowball fight, build a fort and stockpile the 
snowballs and you are set.  The same idea can be implemented in the summertime too.  If 
it’s a nice day, fill balloons with water and have a balloon war.

If you don’t like the idea of your kids throwing balloons at each other than there are other 
uses for water balloons that are just as fun.  Set-up a target and have a competition to see 
who can hit it the most times.  You can make it a challenge to break the balloon each time 
or make it harder by setting the rule of hitting the target but not breaking the balloon.

Play water balloon baseball; replace the baseball with a water-filled balloon.  Of course 
the person up at bat is going to get wet if they are able to hit the target.  If a child hits the 
balloon and it doesn’t burst it is considered a strike.  When the balloon is hit and does 
burst it is an automatic home run.

A simple game of catch can be fun too.  Trying to catch the balloon without bursting it 
can be hard – see how long one balloon can be tossed before it breaks.  As the kids are 
going to get wet, it is best to play any of these games on a hot day.

Clean-up after any game that has involved water balloons is very important.  Small 
children and pets could pick up the small pieces and choke on them.  You can make 
picking up the most balloon pieces a game at the end for incentive.  Let the kids know 
that whoever has the most balloons after they are all cleaned up will get a special 
surprise.  Or, give each a different color of balloon and make it their job to pick up all the 
balloon pieces that are of their color.
