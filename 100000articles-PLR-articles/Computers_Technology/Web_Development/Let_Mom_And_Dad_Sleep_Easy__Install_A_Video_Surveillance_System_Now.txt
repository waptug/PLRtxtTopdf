Even in the dark, it can pick up clear images. This should complete your indoor and outdoor video surveillance system in your little domain. Surprise your mom when she drops by unannounced. She’ll get a pleasant shock to know you are armed with a new toy.

Maximum security from a dime-sized unit

Once you have your video surveillance system camera, connect the receiver with the USB adapter. Activate your computer and place the battery inside the wireless mini spy cam.
