For any Myspace account to have maximum visibility, the features and components on the layout has to be enhanced. The layout will form the base and act as the key to host a variety of feature such as text, data, and images, audio and video files. The layout design assistance can be sought from various sites on the Internet.

One of the major methods in which an account holder can ensure maximum hits to the Myspace site is to spice up the page by adding a variety of features through the layout level. The features could include images, more of landscape art and a plenty of colors. However, to bring all of these on a common platform, you need an appropriate Myspace web page background through layout format. With an appropriate layout, the Myspace web page can be well built to add a number of premium features. The feature rich web page needs a good layout that can host all of them. A layout loaded with plenty of visual features can produce a bad effect on the web page, ultimately leading to poor design. It could also mean the Internet traffic to the web site could slow down. Besides, the opening of the Myspace web page could slow down if the features are heavy and the layout do not support them. In an effort to make the web page appropriate in terms of features and background, design the layout carefully. Make sure that the codes are appropriate and are in synchronization with the designs of the web page and the layout. If the codes of the layout do not match with the web page, there are chances that the entire Myspace page could be damaged. Ultimately, the recovery of the Myspace page could become problematic. It could be damaged permanently. Therefore, the best option is to download the pages with the codes and install them on the Myspace page at the layout level itself.

There are two options to download the layouts for the Myspace page. The first option is free downloads from popular sites and the second option is to go for paid layouts. There are number of rich features under paid layouts. Users also have the option of customizing the layouts according to their personal wishes. There are plenty of tools available for the user to download from the site and opt for the preferred layouts. The options provided are user-friendly. If the user does not find the tools to be in accordance with the preference, there are multiple options to change the preferences. The paid layouts have a number of options that are available in the form of license. Unlicensed layouts are also available, but they are not reliable like the paid layouts.

While building the layout, keep a check on the programs that have to be added on to the background. Too many programs on the background could slow down the account. Therefore, embed adequate number of codes in the layout before actually hosting the programs. Conduct a test run of the layout after installing the programs to identify any inbuilt faults.
