So there I was, I had just hopped in the shower for a nice long hot water massage. Within ten seconds, the water was freezing cold. I then screamed like a little girl and leapt out. You know the drill, right? Surely this has happened to you also. I can't be the only one who's screamed like a little girl. Oh, and then there's the water issue. How many times have you been dowsed with the ice-cold vengeance of a poor water heater? If your answer is none, then you're a minority for sure. But, there's no reason for dwelling on the past.

You turn on the hot water knob and wait. Then you wait some more, swatting your fingertips back and fourth through the stream. Will it ever heat up? And then finally you feel some warm water, which then turns to hot. This process sucks! I dealt with it for most of my life, but then I discovered instantaneous water heaters.

Do you really think any of them care about leaving me a drop of hot water to shower with? HA, that is a laugh. They commonly hit the showers first and I'm left with nothing. But, not anymore. It was instantaneous water heaters to the rescue. Now I can enjoy a hot shower whenever I please. There's no bathing schedule to work around.
