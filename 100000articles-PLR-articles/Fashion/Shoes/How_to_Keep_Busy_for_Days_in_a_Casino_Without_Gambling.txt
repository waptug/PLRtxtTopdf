If you love to shop then you should warm up your credit cards because many casinos also have some of the finest clothing and jewelry shops available. The reason for that is if you win some cash they hope you will spend it in their shops, casinos are also usually built around populated areas where you can take the car and take a short 5 or 10 minute drive and be in the local city, where you have access to local shops and malls full of great shopping centers.

If you are looking for things to do with the kids then look no further. If the casino does not have amusements for the kids, then there is a good chance the casino is located near an amusement park. The casinos open in these areas to make it more attractive to family's on vacation. You can spend the day taking the kids out and then sneak down to the casino after they fall asleep in the room.

Depending on what time of year it is and where the casino is located there may be an outdoor pool you can lounge around get some sun and have a swim. Or maybe the indoor pool and spa may suite your needs better where you can swim some laps after having had a workout in the casinos gym. Then you can even get a massage from fully licensed masseuse before getting ready for one of the casinos fine restaurants, and if that does not suite the family most casinos also offer more family friendly restaurants as well as a few fast food places.

The casinos are not fools they realize that not everyone will enjoy a vacation that consists of sitting for 8 hours a day at a blackjack or poker table, and to cater for this crowd they have loaded their hotels with other activities so the entire family can enjoy their vacation, even without gambling.
