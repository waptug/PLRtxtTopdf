Ever wondered how to buy cheap software?

We are lucky that the Industry of Programming, website design and other areas of interest are not new and are very well established.

Lets take a look at the Website Design Industry as an example. This industry is now a good 10 years old and during this period many software titles have come and gone and many software upgrades have been made.

This leads me to the next question do you really need to spend a small fortune and buy the latest software?

Unless there is a huge improvement in software isn't software that was used 2 or 3 years ago still good to use today? I love designing images and I use Adobe Photoshop which is a great software program but is expensive. To this very day I am still using Adobe Photoshop v6.0 and I really see no point in updating because the things I need to do will be done 98% the same way in newer versions. Generally there are additions that are made and its something you need to take a look at and see if its worth buying.

Apply this method of thinking to any software program that has 6 versions released and you will save money. Generally changes are made during the first 2 or 3 versions and after this version release there really is not any huge improvements made only enhancements.

So it's a question you need to ask yourself if its worth buying the latest software or not. I like having both worlds thats saving money and buying a good product and this method lets me do this.

If I was looking at buying software today the way I would tackle it is by buying software that is 1 or 2 versions old as long as the Software Program is established. The best place to purchase older version software is ebay and always check the feedback from the person your buying from.
