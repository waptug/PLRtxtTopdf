The process of how to become a mortgage broker is not necessarily a difficult one; however, many people get discouraged along the way because they are not aware of the shortcuts that are available to them. If you want to know how to become a mortgage broker and not lose your mind, here are a few simple steps to help guide you along the way.

First of all, you should be aware of the basic process of how to become a mortgage broker. There are certain licensing requirements set forth by the state which require you to pass an exam. Many states also have requirements regarding criminal history that exclude felons and people that have been convicted of crimes of moral turpitude. If you do not have a criminal record, or at least one that prohibits your licensing, and you can pass the exam, you can be a mortgage broker. Where do people get discouraged? During the exam process, it is easy to second guess yourself and your abilities, as the test is not exactly easy.

The biggest mistake people make in trying to become mortgage brokers is studying for and taking the exam on their own. While you may not be able to have someone in there to help with the exam, you can certainly get help in preparing for it. There are several training courses and study classes you can take that will cover the material on the test, answer any questions you have, and provide sample tests. These study courses are invaluable when it comes to preparing for and passing the test.

Another consideration to make is the knowledge and encouragement you can obtain from a mentor. In the same manner that knowing what is on the test can help you pass, knowing what awaits you on the road to being a mortgage broker can help you succeed. There is no reason to travel alone when someone is available to show the way.

On the other hand, you can always do it the hard way. You can order books that are hard to read and seem to complicate things; you can decide to figure things out for yourself and not ask for help when you need it; and you can choose to get discouraged and quit. It is a lot more difficult to be successful when you do things the hard way. However, now that you know the easy way, doesn’t it look more inviting?
