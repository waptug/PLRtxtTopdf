Owning a cat and having it as a pet is not as easy as bringing home a stray one and feeding it every day. As a pet, the cat needs more than food for it to be happy and healthy.

Responsible Ownership
Just like you, your cats also have their basic needs. If you want them to purr to happily ever after, you've to work hard for your cats to attain it. Yes, caring for cats goes beyond the caring part. You have to know what to do and how to do it.

Here's a view of what you should be looking out after as a responsible cat owner.

Food Requirement
Some people feed their cats leftover foods. But you have to understand that those were intended for humans. It may not suffice to the needs of your feline friend. 

So scrap the idea and look over at your favorite grocery store. Weight in what would be the best cat food that you can afford and that most cat owners would also recommend.

It will cost you about $8 to $13 a month to be able to give the quality ingredients to your pets. It can be affordable. Just make it part of the monthly house budget. Or you can opt not to go to the cinemas or what about lessening your smoking habits. This way, you will be able to allot the right amount for your cat food.

Shelter Requirement
If you will allow your cat to live with you, you have to make sure that the surrounding will be safe for your pet. It is just like when you have a baby at home, you don't want anything poisonous and hazardous lying around within easy reach.

You also have to provide a litter box for your pet. The price for this varies from $8 to about $200 for the superb deal and quality. 

Make life easy for your pets. Provide warmth in the shelter. And add onto it with your care and affection. 

Medicinal Requirement
Again, just like a baby, your cat needs to be checked up by their doctors regularly. You have to bring them to the veterinarian as needed. They have to undergo spray or what is also known as neutering. There are also core vaccinations that they have to be subjected with. Each vaccine will differ in cost so you have to save up for each.

To be prepared, consult with your vet how much the next one will cost so that you can save up for it while you still can. Aside from that, your cat has to see the vet for an annual examination. 

You also have to keep some allowance for your cats for emergency needs. You really never know when they would be sick or might encounter some accidents. It is better to be prepared for the worst than to be sorry in the end.

Cat care may be easy to say but definitely hard to do if you are not prepared for the responsibilities it intakes. So before you dream of being a care giver to a pet, think hard about it and check your wallet if you can afford it.
