Article Body:
While many iconic images have been created as part of successful advertising campaigns, some icons have histories as exciting as the products they endorse. For example, did you know that the Doublemint Twins first appeared as only illustrations? They debuted in print advertising for the famous gum in 1939 to communicate its double benefits: a "double wrapped" wax-coated paper seal and a "double peppermint" distillation process used to produce a sweeter, smoother taste. These illustrated twins became the brand's signature and were drawn in ever-changing matching hats for car card and poster advertisements. 

It wasn't until 1960 that the first live twins appeared in television commercials. They sang a catchy theme song that encouraged gum chewers to "double their pleasure" and "double their fun." New sets of twins were cast for commercials throughout the 1970s to 1990s and most recently reintroduced in 2005, as Wrigley continued to offer fun variations on the double theme. 

Now there's another kind of twins associated with the 90-plus-year-old trademark minty taste: Doublemint Twins mints. Like the namesake gum, these mints offer "double good, double fun" but with a blend of two flavors in a single mint. 

New television commercials build upon the brand's heritage of the campaign and the unique jingle but with an unexpected twist as viewers are introduced to a new set of twins-two very different people that are dressed alike as twins.
