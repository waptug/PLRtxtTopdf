Article Body:
12 years ago, I had a Melanoma skin cancer.

Melanoma is not as painful as other type of cancer but it's certainly as wicked, and it had to be removed.

After the surgery, my doctor informed me that I'll probably get the same cancer in 2 years, unless I'll visit the hospital every day for the next 3 years and get Interferon injections.

I remember thinking to myself... "If I'll follow doctor's recommendations, it will make me be aware of the word "Cancer" every single day and would give it the power that this word doesn't deserve.

I don't recommend you to do the same, but regardless of my wife's opinion,
I took a decision, not only to reject the treatments, but also to ignore the periodical medical surveillances.

Deep in my heart, I knew! That if God would decide to take my life then so be it...

Today, 12 years later, I am ignoring even the word "cholesterol" and stick to my insight that

Death is a part of life!

Accepting this insight alone changed my entire life.

To have the guts doing what I did, one must have a very strong belief.

For me it was more then a belief,

I Knew that every thing will be all right.

You are not alone&#8237;!

And Good Luck With Your Journey!
