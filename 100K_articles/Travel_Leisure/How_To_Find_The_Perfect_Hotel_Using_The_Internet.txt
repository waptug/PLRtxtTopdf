So you know you're going on vacation. You know you need to find a good hotel that isn't going to break the bank. You figure that you can use the internet to find that perfect hotel choice, but what's the best way to go about finding it online? Read on for some tips for making your online research most profitable.

In the first place, I am assuming you've chosen a destination for your vacation. Unless the price of the hotel will be one of the factors that will help you choose between two vacation alternatives, you'll most likely know where you are going. With this information, you'll want to start your search at one of the main search engines online. Your choices will be either Google, Yahoo or MSN.

The most basic hotel search you could do would be to enter your destination along with either the keyword hotel or motel. So if you are going to Orlando, Florida, you'd enter a search like 'Orlando Florida Hotel'. This kind of search will give you a list of websites that either are hotels or are listing hotels worth checking out. 

When making a search, it is important to be creative with your keyword selections. Instead of simply typing in something like 'Orlando Florida Hotel', you will want to try other combinations. One good way to get a quality list of hotels is to type in the name of some of the attractions you plan on visiting in the city you've chosen. To continue with our example of Orlando, you could use 'Universal Studios Orlando Hotel'. This will help you to find listings that are near Universal Studios. 

Don't be afraid of using Hotel directories to help you scope out a good potential match. For our example city, using an Orlando hotel directory could yield just the right hotel for your needs. Many of these directories include either reviews and maps on their site or easy to find links to these kinds of resources.

Finally, when doing searches with a search engine, try to think of different ways you can say the same thing. Don't just search for Orlando hotel but search for Orlando motel, Orlando accommodation, Orlando vacation spot and so on. Substitute your intended city destination for Orlando in these example.

Using these techniques and a little time to explore the hotel websites, there is no reason that you can't find that perfect hotel at the price you expect.
