<strong>W</strong>hen you are looking to get  relief from your debt problems, a lot of people tend to feel that the only good  solution is to go about getting <strong>credit  counseling</strong> or to even file for <strong>bankruptcy</strong>.  What a lot of these people do not realize is that there is a little known about  process that is known as debt settlement. The goal of debt settlement is to  allow you to not only meet the requirements and needs of your creditors for  less than what they say that you owe them but to also save you as much cash as  possible throughout the process of it.

<strong>O</strong>ne of the many reasons why a lot  of people choose a <strong>debt settlement  institution</strong> is because their amount of debt amounts are highly out weighing  what they are capable of managing in order to back the full amounts to avoid  having to file for bankruptcy. Another reason as to why a lot of people choose to go about a debt settlement company is simple because they are way too fed up with the credit card companies because they are constantly increasing the interest rates to unfair advantages and they refuse to lower it no matter how much you try and get them to.

<strong><em>H</em></strong><em>owever</em>, the absolutely number one reason as to why people choose to utilize a debt settlement company is to relieve the burden of being in debt. The burden of debt becomes such an overwhelming thing  that their biggest goal is to become debt free and as a result it outweighs the  thought of what could happen to their credit profile if they do not act upon it  immediately. This is why the debt settlement process is something that is gone after when trying to accomplish the goals of getting out of debt and staying out of debt.

<strong>I</strong>t becomes absolutely needed to  eliminate your debt before trying to improve your credit score. This is because  thirty percent of your score is determined by your debt to credit ratio so if  you happen to have a lot of outstanding debt your score will be a lot lower  than it should be which as a result can hinder your chances of getting anywhere  financially. Your credit profile is a good indication of your history in terms of payments and late payments and such but it is one hundred percent possible to improve your score over a period of time because in the United States everyone gets a second chance at doing that.

<strong>B</strong>anking and financial  institutions would love to keep you locked into the state of mind that your  credit score is the absolutely most important thing in your life. Do not get suckered into feeling this way because it's their way of fearing you into doing things their way. It is by all means an important part of your life but in no way should you allow it to dominate your life and make it so that it is the only thing that you care about. These financial institutions do not really care about you; all they care about is making more money. Why else would they raise your credit limit on your <em>credit cards</em> in order for you to charge more things to it? It is because they know that you are likely to fall into some sort of debt like most Americans and as a result they will make more money off of you and your debt.

<strong>W</strong>hen you are looking about the  different options and as debt settlement comes to pass you realize that it is  your choice to become debt free. There are typically two different types of companies that can help you in becoming debt free over time. The first one is the type of Debt Settlement Company that you see advertised everywhere that happen to not be lawyer based. The others are law firms that happen to have a debt settlement service as one of the things that they offer to people.

<strong>W</strong>hen you are searching for a debt  settlement company there are some important things that you really do need to  consider before choosing the right one that will help you become debt free.  There are even some things that you should steer clear from if you want the best possible help for your current financial situation.

<strong>T</strong>he first thing that I would like  to point out is that any of these companies should be able to save you at least  half of your debt including the fees that you have to pay and the paying of  your creditors. While on your own you can typically save around half of that  without too much effort on your behalf, getting any more relief than that will  require a fair degree of experience that you do not have. One thing you need to be aware of when attempting to speak to someone from any debt settlement company is that you should always do your homework first. There are some companies out there that just want to make as much cash as they can off of their clients without any true regard for their own problems. These people say just about anything that you want to hear in order to get you signed up with their programs. 

<strong>O</strong>ne way to see through all of the  best is that some of these companies will tell you that you can set up a  monthly payment for any amount that the client wants. This payment will usually be quite low and for a lot longer period of a time that many of the more reputable companies will allow you to have. This obviously will remove the purpose of what you are trying to accomplish because the longer the period of time you have to pay off a loan the more interest that will pile on and the more you will end up having to pay back as a result.

<strong>W</strong>hen you are looking about the  different options and as debt settlement comes to pass you realize that it is  your choice to become debt free.

The other is law firms that happen to have a debt settlement service as one of the things that they offer to people.

<strong>A</strong> lot of people get into the mind  set that there is a magic way to fix any of their problems quickly. These bad companies understand this need and typically are very good at catering to that and as a result sign up thousands of people on a yearly basis. Be careful of what they tell you because at first it may sound like a great deal but they do not usually include how much it will cost you in the long run. The first thing that you need to ask them is if their claim of savings includes their companies; fees or not.

<strong>Y</strong>ou should also make certain that  you have a realistic time frame for paying back your debt. There is a huge benefit in going with a debt settlement company in that you can become debt free in a short period of time instead of paying the minimum payments to your creditors which with interest takes quite a long period of time to finish up.  You should most definitely pick a debt settlement company that is going to focus on getting you debt free in two or less years only. This is because by stretching your payment plan further than three years time you will never get the full benefits that you are seeking out due to increasing interest piling on. The longer the program is that you sign up for the more debt you will end up having to pay out of as a result of it.

<strong>Y</strong>ou should also make certain that  the collection calls will be stopped from being made. One of the bad aspects of these debt settlement companies is that in order for your creditors to be willing to let you pay less you are going to have to fall behind on your payments to them. As a result of this you will end up getting several calls from collection agencies. This can be very annoying and just straight up aggravating. So when it comes to getting these calls stopped the only way that you can legally get them to is by having a lawyer from the debt settlement company to represent you. 

<strong>A</strong>s a result of this they must  contact your lawyer or they will be faced with a law suit otherwise. If you are told from your <strong>debt settlement company</strong> that you can have these calls stopped to make certain that they have a lawyer to aid you in this. By law a collection agency does not have to deal with the debt settlement company unless they provide you with an attorney. If they tell you to just send a cease and desist letter to the collection agency, be careful, because you will leave them with no option but to serve you with papers to appear in court and as a result could end up being sued.

<strong>Y</strong>ou need to make certain that the  company you go with is a reputable one. To start with you should check out the better business bureau to see if they have any negative comments regarding their business practices. After this you should consider how long they have actually been in business as a general rule of thumb is that a company that has been in business for over ten years in good standing should give you some sense of peace in knowing that they know what they are doing and have helped a lot of people in the years past. 

<strong>I</strong>f the company you go with is only a year or two old be wary of this because there are lots of fly by night operations that sign up lots of people knowing that they are not going to be able to help them just to get the collection fees and when that is over and done with they close up shop and start a new company. If you end up going with a law firm you should obviously make sure that they are registered with the state bar association. If you have a problem and complain, they could lose their license, so it is in their best interest to help you if you go with them and do the best job that they can do for their clients. 

<strong>T</strong>he warning signs are pretty  obvious because if a company has a poor record with the better business bureau  it would be best to stay away. If the company is fairly new be sure to do your homework before going about getting their services as it would be in your best interests.

<strong>E</strong>ven though debt settlement is a  very smart way to go about getting out of debt just like anything you need to  be careful with the place that you go with. If you read this guide carefully you will have a leg up and know how on how to choose the best possible company that can help you and your situation. You too can soon be out of debt completely and have a huge weight lifted off of your chest.
