Here are some fall car care tips from the experts at the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE), who warn motorists that winter is a dangerous time for an automotive breakdown. 

* Begin with the basics. Review your owner's manual and follow the manufacturer's service intervals. 

* Replace worn wiper blades and keep plenty of washer fluid on hand. Check that all lights and bulbs are working. 

* If you're not a dedicated do-it-yourselfer, find a repair shop with a courteous staff, ASE-certified technicians and modern equipment.

* Replace worn tires with all-season radials or snow tires, as conditions warrant; don't forget to check the spare tire and jack. This is a good time to have alignment problems corrected.

* Correct engine performance problems (rough idling, poor acceleration or hard starts) before cold weather sets in. 

* Have a qualified auto 

technician check the condition of your battery and cables, plus the radiator, and all hoses and belts. 

* Make certain the heater and defroster are in good working condition; have the exhaust system examined for leaks, a potentially deadly condition in closed vehicles. 

* Carry emergency gear: flares, boots, gloves, ice scraper, high-energy snacks, a blanket, shovel, flashlight, tire chains, a few tools and a cell phone.

ASE was founded in 1972 as a nonprofit, independent organization dedicated to improving the quality of automotive service and repair through the voluntary testing and certification of automotive technicians. ASE-certified technicians wear blue and white ASE shoulder insignia and carry credentials listing their exact areas of certification. Their employers often display the blue and white ASE sign.
