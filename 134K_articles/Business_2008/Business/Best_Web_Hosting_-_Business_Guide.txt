Say’s Kingsrealm CEO “We have found over the years that choosing a hosting   provider can be a minefield of uncertainty for most companies. Even the best   made plans for web hosting can go bad and leave a company scrambling for a quick   solution to a hosting nightmare. This annual report serves as a guide to help   companies who need to find a hosting provider make that decision a good   one.”

The guide is broken down into useful categories tailored to every business.   Whether your web hosting needs are traditional or extraordinary there is a   selection that will provide you the maximum power and flexibility for your needs   at far lower cost than you might have imagined. 

Having vetted and time tested these companies on over 500 projects we have   kept the best and scrapped the rest so you don’t need to deal with the junk. We   have created a truly useful resource to keep your business safe and   productive.
