} Will Insurance Cover Air Ambulance Transport?\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Air ambulance
 transportation can be extremely expensive.  The cost of one trip in an air ambulance
 can take a chunk out of the wallet and savings.  In some instances, an air ambulance
 transport can cost over $100,000.  With such extreme fees, it seems that people
 can\u8217\'92t afford to be critically ill or injured.  Will insurance cover such
 high rates for air ambulance transport?\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 In many cases
, insurance companies will cover air ambulance transport when it is deemed medically
 necessary.  The insurance company may not cover every aspect of the transport, 
but the patient will not be left fully responsible for the charges.  It is important
 to learn exactly what your insurance will cover and under what circumstances.

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The key term
 here is \u8220\'93medically necessary\u8221\'94.  If the doctor feels the patient
 must be transported by air to another health care facility to receive proper treatment
, then the insurance company will typically go along with the charges and pay for
 the air ambulance transport of the patient.  On the other hand, if someone is hurt
 or ill while out of the country and simply wants to fly home for treatment, the
 insurance company may not look upon this situation very favorably.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 In such a
 case, the patient may be left vulnerable to all incurred charges for the air ambulance
 service.  To protect yourself from this situation, it is possible to purchase air
 ambulance coverage while traveling.  Such insurance is often reasonably priced 
in annual or monthly installments on an individual, family, or group basis.  This
 type of coverage will protect you, your family, and your wallet.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Typically
, the air ambulance service coverage is not only reasonably priced, but available
 to nearly everyone.  Consumers are often concerned about exemptions and denials
 for pre-existing conditions, but frequently there are no such exclusions in this
 type of coverage.   \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 When a patient
 requires air ambulance services, it is standard procedure for the air ambulance
 company to secure payment prior to the flight whenever possible.  If it is not 
possible to prove that insurance coverage for air ambulance service can be secured
, the patient or a family member must pay the charge up front in the form of a credit
 card, wire transfer, money order, or other verifiable payment.  For many families
, coming up with this large sum of money would not only be difficult, but nearly
 impossible.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Keeping this
 in mind, it is important for you to learn what coverage you have for air ambulance
 services.  If you are unsatisfied with the current coverage the insurance plan 
offers, it may be time to consider other options to protect your finances in the
 event of an emergency.  During a medical emergency, stress is high for the entire
 family.  Although no one wants to use air ambulance transport, it is important 
to concern yourself now with this issue.  Contact the insurance company today to
 verify the ins and outs of coverage for air ambulance transport before you really
 need this service.  Your health and your wallet may depend on this information 
in the future.                           \par}
