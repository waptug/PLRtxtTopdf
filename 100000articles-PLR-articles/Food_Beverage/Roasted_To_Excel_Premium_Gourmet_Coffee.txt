Some people who find slurping coffee in specialty shops as an indulgence would definitely agree to the fact that these samples of rich concoction is worthy of the amount paid.  There is nothing quite the same to the taste of specially brewed premium gourmet coffee with its unique aroma that, to some, is synonymous with being serenaded by an orchestra while lying on a luxurious hammock.

Such is the experience of coffee connoisseurs who have met their match of the perfect cup of premium gourmet coffee. Since there are a variety of coffee beans to delve our eyes upon, it usually takes several tries before one can decide which should be a regular partner in our early morning habit. 

There are folks who like the popular dark roasted coffee beans while some are into the light roast that they find are just right for their taste.  The rest are in the middle ground of medium roasted coffee taste.  It all comes down to personal preference, when all is said and done though.  Trying it all to conclude at a decision is not a bad idea for those who are searching for their personal finest choice of coffee. 

Placing a Premium on Gourmet Taste

These roasted beans differ in the way they are prepared, along with the flavor they distinctly bring:
1. Dark roast - Usually a popular choice for those wanting a strong taste of smokiness to their cup of beverage; this comes out of being roasted longer than the other types of beans.  The burnt flavor has a finish to it that could really perk up the sluggish coffee drinker on the way to work.
2. Medium roast - The choice of those wanting a slurp that does not necessarily send them up and about in a second. This type of roasted beans usually produces a flavor that is about right for the drinker who likes to the take time enjoying his cup for its natural taste. 
3. Light roast - As its name implies, this produces a drink that is neither strong nor overly rich in flavor, but offers a natural whiff of coffee taste that is just about enough to be savored by coffee junkies.

Coffee drinkers who have long since determined what their top choices are would really put the premium on a gourmet coffee cup that is just the exact match to their daily grind.  Nothing quite beats the moment of drinking premium gourmet coffee that has been prepared well by baristas who know their business or simply by someone at home who has that flair for excellent taste. Wherever one may be having a blast drinking their premium gourmet coffee, in their offices, in a coffee shop or while lounging at home, it definitely is a little taste of heaven.
