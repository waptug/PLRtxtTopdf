How to Find Sci-Fi Collectable Dealers

Sci-fi collecting is a hobby that is enjoyed by many, including individuals of all ages.  Are you interested in starting a sci-fi collection?  Or, are you looking to expand your current collection of science fiction collectables?  If you are, you may want to take the time to examine professional sci-fi collectable dealers.  From the standpoint of a collector, these professionals come highly rated and recommended.

Many collectors, especially those who are interested in turning a profit, prefer to buy sci-fi collectables in person.  If this is the collecting approach that you would like to take, you will want to start out locally.  Since science fiction is a genre that is popular, especially with movies and books, there are many specialty science fiction stores.  Many times, these specialty stores and the individuals inside of them double as professional dealers.  

Despite the increase in popularity, not all cities and towns in the United States have access to specialty science fiction stores or professional dealers.  In these instances, sci-fi collectors are encouraged to examine traditional hobby shops.  Many hobby shops have a selection, although likely small, of science fiction merchandise that may be collected, including figurines, models, movies, and books.  In fact, many hobby shop owners double as collectable dealers or they can help to point you in the right direction.

In addition to seeing an increase in specialty science fiction stores, due to the popularity of the science fiction genre, there is also an increase in science fiction related events, including conventions or trading events.  The internet is a nice and easy way to stay up-to-date on local, national, and international science fiction events and conventions, especially those where professional dealers will be on hand.

Although many science fiction collectors prefer to make their purchases in person, as it enables them to inspect conditions, not all collectors are able to do so.  Whether it be a transportation issue or a lack of nearby dealers and hobby shops, the internet should be used.  After a close examination, namely with a standard internet search, many collectors are pleased with the number of professional sci-fi dealers who do business online. The internet is also ideal for examining a large selection of products, as well as researching values, and price comparing. 

Finally, many professional collectors, who are also commonly referred to as investors, meet sci-fi dealers through the use of internet marketing.  This is done by joining online communities, like message boards, that discuss the collecting of science fiction merchandise, particularly valuable collectables.  Not only will you likely receive great tips from other collectors, but you may receive professional dealer recommendations as well.

As nice as it is to know how collectors, such as yourself, can go about finding sci-fi dealers to do business with, you may be wondering why you should.  When it comes to buying sci-fi collectables, collectors often have a wide range of options.  For example, science fiction collectibles can be found for sale on online auction websites, at hobby shops, and even in many traditional department stores.  With that being said, what shoppers may find will likely vary.  Most sci-fi dealers specialize in selling rare, hard to find, limited edition, and other valuable collectables.  Collectors who are interested in later selling their sci-fi collections for a profit, as opposed to traditional hobbyists, can benefit the most from gaining access to many of these rare and valuable collectables.

Another one of the many reasons why science fiction dealers are advisable for collectors is because of fair value.  As previously stated, sci-fi dealers often do the proper amount of research to determine which type of collectables are worth their money and business.  This often involves using a number of research guides to their advantage, as well as examining average selling prices, and availabilities.  While most collectors can expect to pay around full value for sci-fi collectables, rarely are they overcharged.  This is not always the case when buying or trading with individual and independent sellers, as they often have the freedom to charge what they want.
