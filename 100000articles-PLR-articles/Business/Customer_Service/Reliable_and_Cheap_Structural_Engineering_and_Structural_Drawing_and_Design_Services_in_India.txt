Article Body:
The boom of computers in the several past decades has made a major impact on almost every field of human endeavor. It has introduced new possibilities also for structural engineers, draftsman whose primary task is to design buildings, bridges and other structures. Structural design can be considered to be a combination of art and science.

Structural drawings are part of the language the same structural engineers use to communicate with contractors, fabricators and regulatory bodies. These drawings describe the details of an object’s supporting members, such as beams and columns, which are designed by the structural engineer.
Structural design software is used mostly for developing architectural and complex machine designs or drawings. It has all the primary features available in commonly used engineering software. The most eminent characteristic of this type of software is that it allows users to differentiate components: to mark different components of a design with different color combinations provided with the software. Using additional structural software, structural analysis and structural drawings are now created by teams separated by thousands of miles, faster, more accurately, cost effective and within deadline in India.

Structural drawings are a task to locate, cumbersome to handle and difficult to view. The apprehension on the well being of invaluable Structural drawings is a common phenomenon worldwide. Structural drawings are crucial in the construction of buildings, ships, aircraft, tunnel, bridges, retaining walls, mines, infrastructure projects, automobiles and any other object subject to significant forces. Structural drawings are executed by structural draftsmen. Structural draftsmen typically work under the structural engineer responsible for the structural design. Skilled structural draftsmen convert the engineer’s sketches into CAD drawings, and also check that the designs conform to the relevant statutes and building codes.
