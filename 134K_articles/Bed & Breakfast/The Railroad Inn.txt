The Railroad Inn 


This country was built as the railroads made tracks across this country. Stop by the historic Railroad inn in Essex, Iowa and be steeped in Railroad lore. There are four guest suites with private baths. You'll even find a period age claw foot bathtub. From the outside you will expect to be stepping back to the past when the railroad was king.

The Railroad Inn is a restored 1902 hotel nestled on SW Iowa Highway 48. From the outside it appears just as it did when it was first built, thanks to some well done restoration. Each of the four rooms is a suite. In the Colonial bedroom is the Jacuzzi and to really feel the times there is a claw foot bathtub in the Rembrandt room. For the folk that like to just lounge, there are a king sized bed with a lounge chair in the Hickory room. The Victoria Suite is for the people that like to cook their own in the kitchenette. Feast upon a delicious breakfast then stop over to the Bradley room to lounge around a cozy fireplace.

This is where the west starts so it is to be expected that a good murder mystery would be a part of your visit. You can talk over the subtleties of the selected murder mystery while enjoying the local wine tasting or for the lover in you, the chocolate tasting. 

During your stay, enjoy the surrounding sites like the art galleries and aquariums. This is a historic town so you can easily go home with suitcases loaded down with antiques from the nearby shops. To complete your visit check out the various historic tours that is offered. But there is so much going on that you'll have to stop at the gift shop to take a memory home with you.
