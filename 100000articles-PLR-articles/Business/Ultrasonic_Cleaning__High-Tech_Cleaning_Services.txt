Are you looking for innovative ways to increase your services and your profit margins? Ultrasonic cleaning services can be a way for your cleaning business to add another income stream that can be highly lucrative.  How does ultrasonic cleaning work?  The item being cleaned is immersed in an ultrasonic tank filled with water and a small amount of cleaning agent, and then agitated with high frequency sound for a brief time.  The item is then rinsed in another tank filled with water and a small amount of rinse-agent, and then dried.

The underlying process is the creation of microscopic bubbles in the liquid.  Agitation causes these bubbles to collapse with great force.  This force produces shock waves up to 20,000 pounds per square inch.  These waves then loosen and displace soil from the item being cleaned - this is called cavitation.  Some of the advantages of ultrasonic cleaning include:

-- Use of state of the art technology.

-- Surfaces and cavities are cleaned without scratching, brushing or scraping.

-- Oddly shaped and complex objects with tiny crevices and holes can be completely cleaned.

-- It takes very short time for cleaning, normally just a few seconds to clean objects such as mini-blinds.

-- The process is simple and uses fewer chemicals than in conventional cleaning.

-- Cleaning is automated making it more efficient than the traditional tedious form of manual cleaning.

The types of items that can be cleaned with ultrasonic technology are almost limitless:

- Window blinds

- Fire restoration, mold restoration and disaster recovery contents

- Electronics

- Plastic and silk plants

- Patio furniture

- Light Diffusers

Cleaning electronic equipment has always been time-consuming and cumbersome.  When using ultrasonics to clean electronics, the process becomes efficient and can be very profitable for your cleaning business.  However, there is a lot of confusion about how the process affects electronic equipment.

Many people believe that electronic equipment cannot be placed in water. While it's true that you should never place electronic devices into water that are still plugged in, use of the proper solution to clean and proper drying techniques allows items to be cleaned and restored using ultrasonics. With the proper equipment and training, there is no damage to electronics being submerged in water.

Many people also believe that ultrasonics will loosen solder joints and the item will not work properly.  This thought is based on the theory that ultrasonics shakes off debris with vibrations. The cleaning process is called cavitation, which forms and collapses tiny bubbles - a safe and effective cleaning method.

Some people don't believe the ultrasonic cleaning process works. This is usually due to a lack of understanding of how the process works. Plus many people have never experienced the results firsthand.  If you invest in the proper equipment and perform the process correctly, ultrasonic cleaning is not only effective, but actually reduces cleaning time and save tons on labor costs.

Ultrasonics is not just for cleaning small items such as jewelry.  Ultrasonics can clean and restore items such as window blinds, light diffusers, small electric appliances, silk plants, and much more. Just think of all the homes and office buildings with mini-blinds and silk plants. The possibilities are endless for your cleaning business.

Adding ultrasonic cleaning services to your cleaning business should not be entered into lightly, as there is a large investment in equipment and training.  However with proper training and an effective marketing plan, ultrasonic cleaning can not only be another service you provide to your clients, but a great added income stream for your cleaning business.
