A Space of their Own

For studying, reading or just for some downtime create a space where your child can go 
during the summer or after school starts to call their own.  Let them help you create the 
space so it has what they need and are comfortable there.

A desk for your child or a work table can be a place to do their homework, crafts, or keep 
their collection.  Communicate with your child what they would like to do in their work 
space and try to incorporate as many elements as you can into their space. 

A quiet space is ideal, whether it be in their room or maybe a corner of the home office.  
But it should be away from the TV and other distractions like a telephone.  Some things 
you may want to consider adding or providing:

*	Shelves for books
*	Pencil/pen holder
*	A cork board and/or whiteboard for posting assignments or keeping important 
reminders
*	A calendar for marking down events or due dates
*	Comfortable chair
*	A lamp or other adequate light source

Consider setting up an office or desk space for your child an investment in their future.  
They will have a sense of pride over their desk and a place that isn’t cluttered or loud to 
concentrate on their work.

As your child gets older, esthetics are going to become more and more important.  
Understanding this will help down the road.  Just like parents feel better when they have 
things in their home that they like, a child needs the same sense of pride and ownership.

Chances are your child is going to need a computer to complete their homework as they 
get older.  If they have one of their own they don’t have to book computer time against 
you or siblings.  Another good investment.
