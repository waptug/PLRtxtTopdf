<p>Whether you are a  professional or a student or a desperate housewife who would always try to cook  the breakfast at the right time for her husband; your MORNING determines how you  would spend the whole day. A healthy morning makes your day more energetic and  keeps you out of being groggy through out. So it would really be a great fun to  type down something on this topic and share some insights. I was pondering over  the topic and wondering where to start exactly and got stuck by a blog "<a href="http://veenix.blogspot.com/2005/10/alarm-clocks-are-bad-how-to-wake-up.html" rel="nofollow">Alarm  clocks are bad. How to wake up and feel better</a>" suddenly while searching  through Google. Fantastic topic and I would certainly love to spend some  minutes on topics like this one. The very first few lines, "<i>Waking up abruptly by the sound of an alarm  clock is an inherently unnatural thing to do. Sometimes you can wake up after 8  hours and feel like crap. Other times, you can wake up after 6 hours and feel  completely rested. The problem lies in what you're doing when you're suddenly  woken up from your slumber...</i>" [Quoted from <b>veenix.blogspot.com</b>]</p>
<p>Really the traditional  alarm clocks are the nothing but the most disturbing instruments that ever can  be kept beside your bed. If we dig out every psychological problem due to  abrupt morning sessions, I would say in most cases we would discover this crap  as the one of the possible reasons. But this is my personal assumption and no  one should be so much decisive about the fact or opinion imparted above as  everyone has his/her right to speak. The more general approach would be that  not all alarm clocks are bad enough. Technology has advanced a lot and lot of  research and development put into this and as a result some great and  innovative products have come out to the market. Alarm clocks with radio from  brands like Jwin, Jensen, Cobra, ConairPhone and some other brands are really  pretty popular among folks. These alarm radios are not only popular for their  trendy look and multifunctional features, but also for their innovative technology.  Let's draw a comparison in between traditional alarm clocks and these advanced  alarm clocks with other useful attachments.</p>
<p>Traditional clocks have  not been so helpful only because of their harsh sound. You need to set the  alarm before going into bed; otherwise you may get up late in the morning. I  still have one such traditional alarm clock that is still capable enough to  scream all through morning. But I've replaced that one with a new alarm radio  and kept that in my collection closet. On the other hand these new generation  alarm clocks are very useful and worthy to keep beside the bed lamp. Alarm  clocks with radio can let you tune in to the radio instead of harsh buzzer. Just  set your radio with low volume that you would expect enough to wake you up as  well as not that harsh and go to your bed without being worried about your  delayed get up. Another significant fact is, DO NOT follow anybody blindly. You  understand yourself and your activities better than anybody else. So it would  be advisable to consult with your doctor for better tips and consult with an  alarm clock expert would be very useful. After all it's the <em>Good Sleep that Matters</em> to us.
