Just as we equip our cars with the latest in safety equipment, it is just as vitally important to outfit our homes and offices with those features imperative for the safety of those within. Fire alarm equipment, especially, is essential to providing a safe working and living environment. But fire alarm equipment is more than just a smoke detector; it is a network of cautionary equipment designed to work in tandem.

Fire alarm equipment naturally begins with the basics that we all know – the fire and smoke alarm. Such an alarm must be properly installed on the ceiling on all levels of the home – even the basement level – so that any smoke or heat can be detected immediately, allowing you to have as much time as possible to exit the home. Keep in mind that fire alarms, once installed, need to be properly and frequently maintained; test your alarms often and replace batteries as needed.

The warning systems of fire alarms can either be confined to the home – alerting those inside; or be integrated into a comprehensive alarm system that contacts a central call center when alarms are sounded.

Also included in fire alarm equipment are operational fire extinguishers. One should absolutely be kept in the kitchen to tackle cooking fires before they spread to the rest of the house. However, you may even want to keep a fire extinguisher on each level of your home for even greater safety.

Obviously, fire alarm equipment for buildings other than private homes are far more complex including sprinkler systems and fire safe doors, as well as floor lighting and lit exit signs to help those inside make a quick exit in case of a fire. Restaurants require an even higher level of fire alarm equipment designed to shut down the kitchen should a cooking fire ensue.

Fire alarm equipment can save buildings, personal possessions, and more importantly, lives. It is absolutely imperative that you install and maintain a reputable and efficient alarm system.
