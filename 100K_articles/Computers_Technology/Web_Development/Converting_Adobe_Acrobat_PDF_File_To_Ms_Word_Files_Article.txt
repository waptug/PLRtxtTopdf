It is becoming increasingly common to find files on the Internet that are in PDF format. In addition, more and more people are creating and sharing documents with Adobe Acrobat. The reason for this surge in usage is quite simple - it is an easy and convenient method for sharing, storing, sending, and retrieving large documents. As a result, it has become the format of choice for many educators, businesses, and government agencies.

If you find yourself in a situation where you wish to convert one of these PDF files to MS Word, however, you might find yourself in a bit of a bind. Unfortunately, PDF files are not created to be so easily converted. In addition, you usually cannot make changes to these documents unless you have the authoring password. This is because the PDF format is essentially a graphical portrayal of the test and is not truly the text. As a result, you cannot simply copy and paste text from a PDF file to a Word file.

If you are simply looking to copy and paste the text, you can go to File in the tool bar and select “Save as Text.” This will place the text from the PDF file into a notebook document, which makes it possible for you to read and make edits to the text. You can then copy and paste this text into a MS Word document. You cannot, however, take the edited text and put it back into the PDF document.

If you want to truly convert the PDF file to a recognizable Word file, you will need to obtain a special software program. These special programs can be purchased at a local software store or an office supply store. By purchasing the software from a store, you will have a hard copy of the program on hand if necessary.

If you are in a pinch or do not feel the need to have a hard copy of the software, you can also download the software from the Internet. There are numerous different programs on the Internet that will assist you in converting PDF files to MS Word files. These programs can typically be found for as little as $20.00, though it can be as costly as $100.00 or more.

When purchasing conversion software from the Internet, it is best to select one that will provide you with a 30 day free trial period. This way, you can test out the software before you make a purchase. Just keep in mind that free downloads can come with malware, adware, and spyware, so select a legitimate program that won't add these additional “free” programs to your computer.

Software that converts PDF files to MS Word files is very convenient to have on your computer. It makes it easier to type and edit documents and can literally save hours of time. Just be cautious to avoid breaking copyright laws when you use this software to make your job easier.
