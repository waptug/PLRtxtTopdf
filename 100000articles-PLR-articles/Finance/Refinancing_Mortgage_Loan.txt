It also helps to reduce your periodic payment compulsions in many ways, reduce the risk and helps to liquidate the equity that has mounted up in the real estate property during the period of the ownership. To get a refinance done on your mortgage, your home must have enough value so that you can justify your new loan.

In the real sense, refinancing mortgage loan can lower down your monthly payments due on the mortgage loan either by refinancing it into a lower interest rate mortgage or by increasing the duration of the mortgage loan, so that you can do the repayment over a long period of time. The cash saved in this can be used to pay the principle amount of the mortgage loan by reducing the payments further. In another way, refinancing can be used to convert available equity of your house into liquid cash, which can be used for other purposes or expenses like child's higher studies or repair and restructuring of house.
