Buy what you like . . . what you really, really like! And you’ll enjoy your selections more with each passing year. Color selection is easy if you relax and listen to the palette “in your head.” It’s the same palette that was at work when you selected your room decor.

If you are on a budget, it is better to buy one sizeable quality item than to purchase a bunch of smaller and cheaper ones.

First, select art for the areas that are the most noticeably bare. Remember that art work is portable. Unlike paneling and wallpaper, you can take it with you when you move.

And speaking of art being portable, rarely should art be hung with anything other than standard picture hooks. And rarely is it necessary to nail into a stud. With standard picture hooks hung into drywall, for example, art work can be easily moved and old nail holes patched in a jiffy.

Framing should be chosen to match and enhance the individual work of art. Then if you move or redecorate, your art will continue to work well for you — even if in a different room.

Hang your artwork low over furniture items. Work out groupings on your floor before transferring arrangements to the wall. Opt for a graceful, warm and harmonious look. (Hanging at “eye level” is a rule for museums - not homes.)*

Make certain that you use two picture hanging hooks for each item. This stabilizes your art and keeps the item level.
