You see, life has an interesting way of trying to put us onto the right path...if we would only stop and pay attention. Often times, the major problems and challenges in our lives arise only to direct us, to nudge us towards the right path, the path that we're supposed to be traveling on. Yet many of us get so wrapped up in the problem itself that we're constantly fighting and pushing away while never being able to see what it's trying to tell us. 

Many of your greatest pains and challenges are simply opportunities in disguise. 

Some of our greatest inventions came out of problems and challenges the inventors were having in their lives. They decided to focus on the solution instead of giving all their energy and thought to the problem. 

During the great depression, while most people were suffering and going through tough times, others found ways to "solve problems" and then helped others cope with those problems. They became very rich in the process. 

You can do the same today. 

Start looking for the answers and solutions to those major problems/challenges in your life. If no one else has yet provided an effective solution to the problem, you may just be the person to do it. 

Problems are everywhere you look, on every corner you turn. Just look around you. People are miserable, they're irritable, they're mad! 

Often times, one of the problems you're having in your life is also something that many others are having as well. Find the solution to it and become the expert that everyone else will look to for answers. 

The best way to become rich is to create value in others' lives. Start with your own problems and find ways to make others' lives easier. 

Open their eyes to what's really going on around them, offer solutions to their problems. In return, they will reward you with money!
