Where to find time for Homework

	As your children get older, or if you are returning to school, you might find that there is not enough time in the day to complete homework.  I’ve just started back to school after an eight year gap, and I have experienced the stress in realizing that there are not enough hours in the day.  I have five children and a full-time job.  Here are some secrets I have found.
	If you have younger children, find a place they can go play while you get some reading done.  Our local mall has a play area with cushioned seats for the parents to watch.  My boys like to go play there and it is entertaining for them.  I can sit and watch them while I get some reading done for my science class.  There are other places that you can take your children too, including the park.  Just check around your neighborhood for ideas.
	Take your homework with you wherever you go.  You never know when you might have fifteen minutes at the doctor’s office to write down the answers to homework questions or read that last chapter.
	Swap play times with a friend.  Since I have to get homework done during the week for my class, I don’t have a lot of time during the week, but a lot more on the weekend.  I have found that I can get a friend to take my kids for a few hours during the week and then take hers for her on the weekend.  This gets her out of the house for a few hours, and gives me time I need during the week to complete my homework.  Older children are a great help also.  I’ve found that bribery works well too.
