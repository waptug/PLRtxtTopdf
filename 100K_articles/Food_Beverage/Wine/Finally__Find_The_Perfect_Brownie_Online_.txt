There are few baked goods that bring up memories of days past as well as the brownie. How many of us recall the deep aroma filling the kitchen as a mother or grandmother baked her delicious treats for us? And how many recall her stern admonition of “that’s hot” when they came out of the oven? Then the long wait as we stood around the counter or the kitchen table, hopping on one foot and then the other, all the while eyeing those dark chocolate treats as they cooled.

Baking takes time, and many are unable to devote extra hours to this activity. It takes time to gather up the ingredients, prepare the ingredients, and then the actual oven time on top of that. For many families, baking is simply not an option.
