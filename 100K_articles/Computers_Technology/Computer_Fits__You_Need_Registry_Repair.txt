Is your computer getting slower and slower? Is this occurring despite not using any more memory? Are you having frequent freezing or spontaneous shutdowns? You may have tried erasing all the programs that you don't use with no success. You may even have tried anti virus software thinking that you had been infected by a virus, and were disappointed to find that this didn't improve things.

Well I have good news for you and bad news. The good news is that your problem is common and repairable, and also that you were on the right track. The bad news is that you are probably suffering from the symptoms of a virus infection and that you probably need to get a tool that will clean your registry which is yet another cost incurred.

A computer registry is the part of your operating system that monitors and records the information for all the settings and preferences of the users for all hardware and software. Whenever a change is made it is recorded in the registry. As such it becomes cluttered and congested with time. The registry can also be manipulated with virus code to give up sensitive information and to cause malfunctions in the operating system. Just like any tool you use your computer needs regular maintenance and repair including a good thorough registry repair.

You need to be careful though when you select a registry repair tool as there are many out there with varying levels of effectiveness and related risk. You see it is possible to make changes in the registry that are irreversible and can forever affect negatively the proper performance of your computer. So how can you make a good informed decision?

Well there are several publications dealing with computer technology that will regularly review products such as registry repair software and give feedback on the pros and cons of each product. You need to pick one that is on the mainstream market for sure as they have had the most thorough testing and review and generally come from the most trusted sources. Also pay attention to the banter on the net. There are several forums that you can go to to ask questions and get feedback from actual users like you who have used the software themselves. This can be extremely helpful as long as you take all this advise with a grain of salt.

Be careful but also be excited because you will be amazed at the difference that a little maintenance registry clean will change the operating performance of your pc.
