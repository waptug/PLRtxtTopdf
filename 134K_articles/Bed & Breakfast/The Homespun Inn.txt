The Homespun Inn


The Midwest is the breadbox of the world. It is also home to farmers and just regular folk. Playing on that theme is the Homespun Country Inn located in Nappanee, Indiana. The appearance of the all American Farmhouse is enhanced by quarter-sawn oak in the entry and first floor common rooms. Stained glass windows add a prism effect on sunny mornings. Each of the two parlors on the main floor have an ongoing jigsaw puzzle or just select a book for some relaxing reading. Making this inn unique are the guest rooms named in honor of the original 1902 occupants. 

Frank and Alma Brown's room is named after the original owners. A lavender and sea foam green motif surround the queen-sized bed. The farmhouse look is completed with the three drawer mirrored dresser. Also on the second floor is Wilma Terwillinger's room. 

The Browns niece's room has an adjoining private bath and a queen-size bed. Even one of the lodgers taken in by the Brown's has earned a room. Miss Allman's room is accented in blue. Schoolhouse memorabilia surrounds the queen-size bed. Climbing to the third floor the Brown's granddaughter has lent her name to Jodi's room. Apropos for a granddaughter, we find twin beds, a private bath and a décor of mauve, blue and cream colors. Also on the third floor is another granddaughter. Sally's room holds a queen-sized bed and a pullout sofa. Each of the rooms is decorated with photos of the original occupants.

Early risers are treated to coffee and flavored teas in the dining room. A full breakfast is also served by candlelight at 8:30. Step outside and enjoy the calming effect of the porch swing. This is Amish territory and not an uncommon sight to see their horse and buggy's pass by.
