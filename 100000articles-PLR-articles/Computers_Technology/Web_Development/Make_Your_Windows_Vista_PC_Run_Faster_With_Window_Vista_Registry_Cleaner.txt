Before we start our discussion on the Window Vista registry cleaner, let us take a look at the functions of registry and need of registry cleaning software. From the Windows 95 version, Microsoft introduced the registry into their operating system to store vital information about the hardware and software configuration of the PC. Before that this job used to be done with the INI files that remained scattered through out the hard disks. Surely, introduction of the registry was a great idea as it introduced a more organized way of keeping the records. But there is disadvantage of this process as well. Each time you install or uninstall a software, make changes to the PC settings, file associations, system policies, a new registry entry is generated and stored in the registry. Over the time, as you keep using the PC the number of registry entries also keep mounting. As outdated entries are not deleted, the registry becomes cluttered with outdated records, making the system slower and prone to frequent failures. Registry cleaner software deletes these unnecessary entries and keeps the registry clean so that your PC gives flawless performance.
