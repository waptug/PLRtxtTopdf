One of the most important things to remember when playing in a land based casino is that the layout of the casino is designed to pull you into the games with the worst player odds. To help pull you further into the casino the casinos will usually use the bells and whistles of slot machines, and video poker games.

This may make you think that the slot machines on the way to the blackjack, poker, roulette and craps tables are the ones to play, but this is usually not the case.

The casinos will place some loose machines in the area leading to these games so that you will hear the bells ad look up and see the flashing light from the winning machines, and when you look you will see the table gamming areas of the casino.

This method puts the thought of wining and table games into your mind together making you think you can win at the table games. The truth is that your chances of going home from the casinos a millionaire is only likely if you walked into the casino as a millionaire.

This does not mean you can not go home with more money in your pockets then when you entered the casino or online casino. It only means that you need to be smarter and not fall for the casinos tricks.
