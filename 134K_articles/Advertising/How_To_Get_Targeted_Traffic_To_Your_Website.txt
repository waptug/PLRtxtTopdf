Article Body:
There are many options out there.  Paid traffic and Free traffic. Now, here's one thing to consider. Even people who are good at the pay-per-click and expert converters still include other traffic methods into their marketing way. Why? Because it's a the way to do. First of all, they'll make more money because all these methods work well altogether. (And if they have a good design that has a high conversion with cold leads, conversion rates should be that much higher when the leads are warm.) And, it's also never good idea to put all your methods in one basket. You should extend your traffic methods everytime. After all, you never know when one place is going to disappear, and if all your traffic is based on that one method, then you're entire business is at risk.

What is the targeted market and in which ration visitors can search such website. Is there international market for such product? All things are very necessary before starting to design any website for business. Audience is the key step in the website designing and planning process. 

Those that are different are often the ones who come out winning in the competition. When you want to be on top of your industry, it's time for you to start planning on ways for your business to be distinctive from the rest. 

Now, consider this scenario. If you have people coming to your site who already have some idea who you are, like what they hear and are interested in finding out more, then your job to turn them into paying customers just got a whole lot easier. Warm visitors, or a warm list of prospects, will respond much more favorably to your sales messages. They're also more forgiving. The sales letters may not have to be absolutely perfect for you to get a decent conversion rate. That's because they already know, like and trust you (and people buy from those they know, like and trust) so all you have to do is match what you're selling to their needs. 

That said, I don't want any of you to panic because you don't have a variety of traffic strategies in place yet. Instead, pick one traffic tactic to focus on (use the above questions to get some idea on what that should be). Once you get that one down, pick a second one. And so on. Before you know it, you'll have lots of traffic swarming to your site.
