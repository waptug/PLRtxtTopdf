-	Some people find this handbook very repugnant. It contains grim and frightening illustrations.  Thus the wicked line drawings of "blue bloater" and "pink puffer" looks like depiction of the dark ages regarding hell. People with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) never denied the fact that they are going to face death younger than their cohorts. 

-	Those who are more than fifty five years old may feel that hopes are robbed from them. This handbook failed to encourage them to lead worthwhile lives. Instead they suggest reading "courage books" offering stories of dignity, capability to cope, and hope.  

-	A licensed psychotherapist who read the entire book never recommends it. Some contents associated with facing anxiety and depression may damage the patients psychologically.

-	Some medical doctors find this handbook a very useful tool. It is because COPD is clearly discussed in plain English. In fact, COPD sufferers can easily learn and understand facts about the disease. This is appropriate for COPD dummies.

-	Some people have given their testimonials how this handbook has helped them a lot. One reviewer said that the breathing exercises found in this handbook helped his father with serious emphysema condition. His father's heart failed to function so the doctors let him breathe through an oxygen tank to keep his heart out of fibulation. But after doing the exercises, his condition slowly becomes better until oxygen is not anymore needed. 

-	The 1990 handbook edition helped one of the patients who were diagnosed with emphysema. He even considered this handbook superb since it immediately toured him and learn about emphysema taking away his ignorance. The firm foundation of the handbook is the posted break through in medical advances. It includes herbal therapy and LVRS or Lung Volume Reduction Surgery. Changes in the practices associated with health insurance ensure that COPD patients can still get the best quantity and quality of treatment.  

Living with COPD can be the most overwhelming and exhausting burden. Patients as well as their caregivers may continually live in fear of air running out, their abilities prematurely dwindle, and struggle in their fragility. 

Some people who are close with people with bronchitis and emphysema are usually depressed, angry, and frightened. However, doctors are treating their COPD patients in the best way possible. But the problem is that many doctors only focus on the medical aspects of treating COPD rather than giving rehabilitation. 

The Chronic Bronchitis and Emphysema Handbook can help people with COPD as well as their families to achieve a more realistic perspective of the disease. This can allow them to live calmly and confidently although they have chronic bronchitis or emphysema.
