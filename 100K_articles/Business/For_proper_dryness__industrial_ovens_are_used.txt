Industrial ovens are used for the removal of solvents from different products that are in process. Such ovens also reactivate glue and other fuse materials jointly and preheat, dissolve and coat other materials. Too much heat and mass is needed for such processes. 

The requirement of type of heating material may vary from business to business and their processes. Industrial ovens are planned with a combination of types of heat transfers. 
 
The two main patterns that chiefly exist for industrial ovens are batch and continuous ovens. A large number of ovens mainly came under the batch category in which the whole is divided into different batches. But continuous ovens are automatic system in that budge big amount of products through the oven.
 
Industrial ovens are often used in a broad variety of business firms like paper coating, fabrics, industrial and encrusted fabrics, technical textiles, weaving industries, carpeting industries and construction materials. 
 
The industrial ovens can be divided into three categories: conduction, convection and infrared. In conduction, direct heat is supplied to only one part, which exhilarates the electrons and the heat from a hot plate is transferred to the underside of the product. Convection is similar to way in which gases or liquids are heated. Infrared ovens heat the material itself and such type of ovens use radiant heat. 
It is better to select the suitable energy source always keep in mind that exact processes can be achieved through exact control of temperature.
