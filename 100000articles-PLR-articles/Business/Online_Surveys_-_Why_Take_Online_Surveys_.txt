Article Body:
People have been profiting from taking online surveys. Paid online surveys are a new trend especially in the marketing research field. More and more companies are using the services of specialized websites that can provide a database with subjects for the research panel. 

The people in those databases have online survey jobs, meaning that they have created an account on a specialized website in order to be selected for research studies and get paid for every survey they take. Taking online surveys can be very convenient for many reasons. Here are a few of them:

Anyone can do it

Online surveys are not limited to people within a certain age group or living in a certain country. You can do it no matter how old you are and where you live. It is very convenient for teenagers who can't have a job, new mothers who have to take care of their babies or for retired people. All you have to do is create a Pay Pal account if you don't have one yet. In case you do, you can use the one you already have.

You earn some cash

For every survey that you take, a certain amount of money is transferred in your Pay Pal account. You probably won't make a fortune, but you can make some extra money with just a little bit of work.

You work from home

With online surveys, you don't have to travel to your office every day, wear a suit and a tie and deal with demanding bosses or rude colleagues. You can work from home in your pajamas and without having someone getting in your hair.

Everything is up to you

You get to decide how many surveys you want to take every month and what are your working hours. You can sleep late if you want to and work in the evening and you can take a break any time you feel tired or have something else to do. You can take a vacation or stop anytime you want.

It's a real job

Online surveys are something real. The companies that are ordering those surveys really want to build something based on your opinions. They don't do it just out of curiosity. Your opinion will really contribute to something.

It's easy

You won't have to answer complicated questions. You just have to say what your opinion is on certain aspects. What could be simpler than that?

Its fun

You are selected to be part of a research panel based on your specific characteristics. If they meet the research profile, you're invited to take a survey. This means you will be answering questions about things that are of interest to you and you can have a good time. You can also get invited to interviews and focus groups, which are even more fun and usually better paid.

There's no catch about online surveys. You earn some money that companies are willing to pay to get enough responders. They will be satisfied to get their research done and you will be happy to make some extra money with very little effort. This can be an excellent way to earn some extra money each month or maybe make a full time job of it working from home.
