Multi-media technologies, are a meld of audio, video, and imaging software, used to capture, edit, store, and search, retrieve, transfer, distribute, and access information through multiple means. Hence – the term multimedia. 

As these technologies become more advanced and versatile, they’ve enabled content creators to  design and facilitate the presentation of information to  new levels. 

What about the audience? Today’s audience  is highly sophisticated, with a bigger  appetite for media experiences where fast motion, brilliant color, energy, textures, powerful sounds, and richer content are the order of the day, engaging their senses, and piquing  their interest. 

The good news is, the use of multi-media technology has gone mainstream. There are many websites which offer free and cheap downloads of multimedia programs to give anyone from the budding filmmaker, teacher, the lawyer, CEO, marketing whiz, and to the homemaker the  ability to communicate their ideas, in vivid details, from the big picture to the tiniest details. 

Indeed, these technologies permeate our daily existence. And makes it a fair question to ask. “Is there value to be found in using multimedia technologies?” Yes, and here’s why.

In today’s world, information has become the new currency, with many countries  scrabbling to move heavily into an information-based society. Technologies such as multi-media software, give an added advantage to it’s’ users, providing them the tools to clearly convey ideas and thus, produce valuable content. That gives them premium importance.  

Nevertheless, it may surprise you to know that not only has multimedia technologies revolutionized the way we live, work, create, but it has spawned new industries and killed old ones. 

For instance, in the work place, these technologies provide office workers the means to communicate, and collaborate, with colleagues on the other side of the planet, from  different time zones, through desktop video conferencing, shared workspace, and multimedia messaging. Companies in fact,  purchase multi- media technologies, to provide the employees the ability to create, edit graphics audio and video files, and use these to create presentations, and other work related products.  
For one’s entertainment needs, there’s a choice between movies or videos on demand, and pay-per-view, among others. In this instance, multi-media technologies give the consumer the freedom to select what she, or he wants to watch.  
For audiophiles, there are many free and cheap software programs, which provide  the users the freedom to select the file format, how it will be recorded, and where it will be stored. All you’ll need is  a high bandwidth, and the pc equipment to record and capture the audio.  
For serious gamer’s multi-media software have created stimulating new games, better quality special effects, richer playing environments, betting/gambling software, multiplayer games, and polling. These technological tools, have accelerated the growth of the video game industry, and  expanded research for better computer graphics, simulation, modeling, and artificial intelligence.

Even if you were not a serious gamer, you would greatly appreciate the ability to download interactive video  games, while you’re in your pajamas, in the privacy of your home.  
                              
Advertising has become intuitive, for as the differences between television and the internet continue to blur, advertisers have turned to interactive infomercials, to get consumers to buy. These tools allow advertisers to track the users’ preferences and create an infomercial especially suited to the users’ needs. Another nifty product is the virtual catalogue, where the customer can inspect the products before purchasing them, in the privacy of their home.            
                               
The use of multimedia technologies for home shopping, banking and financial transactions, telephony, medical advice, restaurant or hotel guides, is a commonplace  activity for consumers. 
 
Even the way we learn and package information from books, magazines, atlases, and newspapers has improved. One brilliant example is the educational CD Rom. Think about the fact that an entire 32-volume Encyclopaedia Britannica book set can be compressed into two cds.

In retrospect, one can see the world has benefited immensely with the use of multi-media technologies. It has brought humanity closer by making distance a non-issue,   freedom of choice a reality and the conveyance of ideas, more precise.
