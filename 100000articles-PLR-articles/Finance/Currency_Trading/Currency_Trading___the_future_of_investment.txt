Forex Trading, meaning Currency Trading, is a world wide, little known market, which will become the most popular source of income for investors in the very near future. It is open for banks, rich investors and small ones alike and, depending on the sum of money they are willing to risk, the earnings demonstrate this is the best way to start getting rich.

Why choose currency trading over stock, real estate or futures trading? The currency trading advantages are speed, liquidity, commission-free transactions, increased safety, short-term trading and great earnings. Let’s study each of these advantages in other trading systems: 
-Speed: Currency trading is instant due to a large amount of transactions while future trading implies a longer time to trade certain commodities, agricultural products, financial instruments and goods (contracts need to be written and signed)
-Stock traders must pay brokers a certain fee for each transaction made. The brokerage fee is available for all futures transactions, but not in the case of currency trading. In currency trading brokers earn money by studying and profiting from the difference of price between sold and bought currencies.
-Liquidity: The currency market is opened non-stop, anywhere in the world giving currency traders the chance to trade whenever they find the opportune moment and prices. This is a characteristic attributed only to currency trading.
-Safety: while other trading systems are based on speculation, on the fluctuation of price, on slippage and market gaps, currency trading is controlled with the help of built in safeguards that limit slip-ups. 
-Short term trading, like currency trading, is more efficient for profit making than long term trading. Day trading does not increase speculation, risk and does not imply that the broker’s commission will reduce any profit made.

Anyone can start trading currencies. This means Currency Trading is easy therefore making money is easy! The potential profit that can be made by buying and selling currencies and with a minimum capital for investment is amazing. Currency trading techniques are available online for learning for those interested in doing so, but the best choice would be to let a broker do business for you.

The Currency market is very vast and it involves traders all over the world.
Therefore the market can not be monopolized, cornered in any way for a single beneficiary. There are many participants, many banks involved and currency trading is a global phenomenon. The amount of business done during a particular period of time by the Currency market is 30 times bigger than that done by the US Equity markets. The average sum of money exchanged during one day of transactions with many currencies goes over 1.6 trillion US$. The impressive numbers don’t stop here. The Currency market predictions of growth in the futures are over 2.0 trillion US$. These facts together with others (like the lack of physical location or centralization of any kind) offer the Currency trader safety.
