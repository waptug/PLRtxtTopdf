Modern Coffee Makers 

Indeed, the new Krups collection hints at a better style and function than ever before. These are their types of coffeemakers:
1.  Automatic-drip coffee machines have a large 10-12-cup capacity that are programmable.  These are fast and efficient as well as filled with the latest features such as aroma selection among others.
2.  Pod machines are made of stainless steel and are programmable.  These are easy to clean and brew in as fast as one minute.

One may also wonder about the differences between an automatic-drip coffee maker and the pod machine.  These gadgets use different styles of coffee-bean containers.  The automatic drip machine brews coffee beans which are separately packaged from the filters.  The pod machines are designed to hold pre-packaged beans with their own filters, ready to be installed and used for a quick brewing.

Pre-packaged coffee pods are ideal for those who only want a cup or two of brewed coffee since it already has a fixed amount in its container.  For the automatic drip, one can measure according to the number of cups desired for one brewing.  Whatever the case may be, Krups coffee makers are designed to answer the individual coffee-drinking patterns of their customers.
 
Just a quick note on brewing for added satisfaction.  The use of tap water is not usually encouraged since it can have residues due to its impure state.  Highly recommended for brewing are mineral and distilled water so as to ensure a preservation of the original coffee taste.
