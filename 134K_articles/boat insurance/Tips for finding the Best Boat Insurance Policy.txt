Tips for finding the Best Boat Insurance Policy

In order to obtain the best possible insurance coverage for your particular watercraft consider taking the following steps.

Research a number of insurance companies, as well as a variety of policies on the internet. This will help you to determine which features you would like to have written into your policy, and which ones you may not feel as strongly about.

After investigating as many companies as you can, select 3 or 4 which offer the most extensive packages. Be certain that each company will be able to meet or exceed your insurance needs by viewing their policy options. When selecting these companies also consider which ones have the most experience in dealing with the type of insurance you want. Boat owners should consider choosing companies which specialize in boating insurance, rather than other types of insurance.

Get at least 3 quotes. These can be obtained online, or by contacting a representative from each company, to explain what you want, and request a quote. Obtaining a quote does not obligate you to purchase the insurance. If you are not satisfied with the coverage offered, or the rates quoted, then you can simply say “No thank you.”

Don’t be pressured into selecting a policy, until you feel confident that you have found the right one. Before you purchase any policy take the time to talk with a representative of the insurance company. Evaluate the service that representative provides. If you do not feel comfortable with one company, consider looking into another. It will be important in the future, should you need to file a claim, that you feel confident that the representative will be attentive to you as a customer.
