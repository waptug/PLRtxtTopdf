I am sure by now you may have already heard about taking surveys to earn money. You can get paid for survey participation. Today there are more advertising companies offering the opportunity. It is good for them because they can service their marketing clients better and it is good for consumers because they can easily earn additional cash. People working from home, students, housewives and many other people earn up to $500 per month just from completing several paid surveys.

All you need in order to get paid for survey participation is to join a web site of a company gathering survey participants. Soon after you are approved, you will start receiving surveys. 

The first survey may come on the same day you have joined or within the first two weeks. How soon this will happen and what amount of surveys you will be receiving per day or per month depends on your profile - if you are a male or a female, your age and interests. This is because each company is conducting researches within specific target groups - for example, consumer reviews for a new lipstick will be addressed to females, age 25 to 47, of certain income level and even social status; new sports equipment survey may be sent to both male and female who pointed out that they are interested in sports.

If you have plenty of free time, you can join several marketing agencies. Thus, you are increasing the chance to receive surveys more often and earning more money.

Bear in mind that some surveys do not offer money rewards. Instead, to get paid for survey participation, you may receive a product or a service as a gift. For example you may receive a discount on some of the products from the company that ordered the survey, free trials, coupons, samples or you may even enter a price draw.

It sounds so easy to get paid for survey participation. However, you still need to “do your homework” before joining any paid survey programs. There are a few things to watch out for. What are the application terms especially if a membership fee is required? Is the site legal, Is it a real marketing company but not a pyramid company, in case you are offered paid access to a database of companies looking for people to participate in their surveys - try to find the same lists for free (there are so many web sits that will offer you the same information for free), be very careful about privacy issues. Never give out your personal information until you have done all of your homework. Even if they are a reputable company limit the amount of personal information that you give them.
