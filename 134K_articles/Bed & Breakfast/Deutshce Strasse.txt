Deutshce Strasse

Old world charm is marvelously reflected in this building built in the Frank Lloyd Wright style. Deutshce Strasse Bed and Breakfast is the 1884 home that was renovated in 1915. Old world charm is displayed throughout your experience in the great north. Guests are welcomed in the welcome room on the main floor with its grand piano and period architecture. As you step into the formal dining room you will imagine you have entered a chalet on the Alps. This feeling carries through to the living room and the candlelit marble fireplace. As you mount the stairs to your room, you will forget you are in Minnesota.

The king size bed with the ornate scrolled metal head and footboards may not indicate this is the Castle room but the suit of armor in the sitting area for two gives it away. The private bath comes complete with a pedestal bath and rain shower. 

The Crystal room boasts a queen-sized antique brass bed. Crystal accents complete the room's ambience. Step into the two-person whirlpool tub with the original ceramic floor and wall tile. This room was originally the master room. 

The queen-sized four-poster bed is most prominent in the Flower room. Even the headboard has flowers. We find, in the private bath, a shower and an original pedestal sink. 

Ivy outlines the canopy frame of the queen-sized bed in the Ivy room. Grab a book and cuddle up by the fireplace on the cool evenings. The private bath includes a shower with three showerheads that is referred to as a full-body shower.  

The Black Forest room is two rooms decorated with items from the black forest region of Germany. This room also boasts a full bath and a room with a hot tub and fireplace. Don't miss the cuckoo clock on the wall in this room!
