Bluetooth wireless provides hands free availability to a wide variety of technology products. Bluetooth is all the rage with computers, cell phones, PDAs and other handhelds, printers, and now GPS systems.

Bluetooth Wireless technology has the ability to do a wide range of things. With Bluetooth, you can use a Treo Smartphone for wireless headset calls, connect to the internet with a better connection through your cell phone, connect your computer to the internet through wireless technology, and send messages to others. These things have nothing to do with your GPS system, unless it works through a laptop or PDA.

One of the primary GPS functions with Bluetooth enabled is wireless productivity when you download maps and directions. With Bluetooth, gone are the days of having to connect to the Internet the old-fashioned way (through a computer). You can now browse for the map of your choice and download it directly through your GPS unit. That is just one of the many marvels of Bluetooth technology.

Additionally, some of the Bluetooth-enabled GPS units, such as the Garmin Nuvi 360, have the ability to make phone calls. The GPS unit has a built in speaker and microphone. With Bluetooth technology enabled on the GPS device, the user can make hands free phone calls through the mobile phone service. On the Garmin Nuvi 360, making calls is a piece of cake. All you have to do is touch the Nuvi screen, dial the number, and speak into the microphone. It is as simple as that.

The Nuvi has a phonebook as well as a phone call history storage area. You can use this to dial if you prefer to use a number you have stored in your GPS system. However, there is more to Bluetooth than simply using it to make phone calls and download directions.

Your ability to connect multiple devices to one another has become increasingly simple. Maps from your GPS can be sent easily to your computer, cell phone, palm pilot, and even another GPS system with Bluetooth! When you enter your home, your Bluetooth enabled cell phone emits a signal, which allows your home phone to “sense” your presence. All calls from your cell phone are re-routed to your landline now that you can answer the phone. With all your technological devices working together thanks to Bluetooth, your life can run a lot smoother. You no longer have to flip between computer, phone, PDA, GPS Unit, and so forth, with little to no effort or worry about losing information.

Essentially, Bluetooth makes your life easier, and your GPS capabilities are extended beyond anything you thought was possible for a GPS Unit.
