The eBay Trading Assistants Program

If you excel at eBay auctions, you might want to 
consider an additional source of revenue as well. The 
eBay Trading Assistant Program will allow you to 
sell items for other eBay members on consignment. 
Being successful at your own auctions is the key 
to becoming a successful trading assistant for other 
people.

Often, newcomers simply don’t know how to make 
their items sell. Many people who are auctioning off 
a one time big ticket item, such as cars or real 
estate, will often employ the services of an eBay 
Trading Assistant. Items such as these can add 
up to very big commissions for serious trading 
assistants! Usually, trading assistants are 
responsible for every aspect of the auction, 
including shipping the product to the customer and 
collecting payment. For high ticket items, the person 
who hires 

Trading Assistants get access to trading assistant 
marketing materials which are quite helpful. In order 
to become an approved trading assistant, you must 
have sold at least ten items in the last ninety days, 
have a feedback score of at least 100 with 97% 
positive feedback or higher, and your eBay account 
must be in good standing.
