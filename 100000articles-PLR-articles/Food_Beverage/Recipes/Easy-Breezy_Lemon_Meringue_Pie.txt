Lemon Meringue Pie seems to say warm weather, maybe because it's as yellow as sunshine and has clouds of sweet meringue. Simple to love, it was a real challenge to make until now.

Here's a recipe that's quick and easy but still has that homemade flavor you crave. Starting with a lemon bar mix gives it a luscious citrus flavor, while eggs and sugar make it taste so fresh and rich. And the crust? Golden, buttery and sweet. 

Serve the pie warm from the oven for oohs and ahs, or for easy Lemon Meringue Bars, just make the recipe in an 8-inch square pan and serve chilled. 


Lemon Meringue Pie


Lemon Pie:

1 package Krusteaz Lemon Bar Mix (1 pouch each lemon filling mix and complete crust)

3 whole eggs

1/3 cup water

Meringue:

3 egg whites

1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar

1/4 cup sugar

Preheat oven to 350°F. 

For Lemon Pie: Press full pouch of complete crust firmly into bottom of lightly greased 9-inch pie pan or 8x8-inch pan. Bake 8 minutes (crust will be pale). In medium bowl, whisk full pouch lemon filling mix, water and whole eggs together until well-blended. Pour over hot crust. Bake 22-26 minutes or until center does not jiggle when shaken and top begins to brown. 

For Meringue: Using an electric mixer, beat egg whites and cream of tartar on medium speed until frothy. Gradually add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating on high speed until stiff glossy peaks form. Spread over baked pie. Return to oven; bake an additional 10-15 minutes or until light golden brown. Serve pie warm, or chill if served as a bar. 

Makes 1 pie or 16, 2-inch bars.
