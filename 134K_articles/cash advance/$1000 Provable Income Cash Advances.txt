$1000 Provable Income Cash Advances

There are companies that will allow you to borrow money in the amount of around $1000 as long as you pay it back within the parameters of their repayment structure.  Inevitably, though, you will end up repaying more than you borrowed because of the interest that is added onto these cash advances.

Some companies, however, do not allow themselves to loan out such a high amount; instead, they stick to the lower amounts such as $200 and up to $500. Obviously, if you need to borrow a higher amount, then you had better do your research. Don't get your hopes up about borrowing from one particular company that might disappoint you in the end by not providing the amount that you need to borrow.

Cash advances are seen more as a last resort to many people and should only be used when you have absolutely no other option; however, some argue that they are helpful if only a small amount of money is needed that a normal loan company cannot provide. Most loan companies cannot provide any amount lower than $1000 and will turn you away.  A cash advance company might not see anything lower than $1000 as too small of an amount, rather, that might see it as a higher amount and therefore tack on a higher interest rate.

A $1000 loan will be hard to get at a loan company, but if you do find one that will provide you with a loan for that amount, then you are better off using the loan company than the cash advance company because they will not require you to pay as high of an interest rate as a cash advance company would. In the long run, working through the loan company will pay off as your payments decrease.
