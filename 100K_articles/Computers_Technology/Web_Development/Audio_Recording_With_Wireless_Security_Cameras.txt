Answer:

There are States that have different regulations about this issue, but most States are in agreement that videotaping a nanny without her knowledge is legal as long as there is no audio involved. You have to be very careful when it comes to audio. If the nanny is told about the monitor and agrees to it, it should be OK to do the videotape to protect the child as long as the parent feels a sense of security about the whole thing. This will protect the parent and prevent any child abuse.

The answer clearly is defined by excluding audio from the camera. You have to know how to use it responsibly. A business owner should inform his/her employees that he/she has a hidden camera. In most businesses, it is quite obvious that the camera is displayed. The homeowner has the most freedom to use the camera in the home as long as it does not harm anyone. If a homeowner is going on vacation or away from home, then a camera is a way for them to feel more secure.

A security camera is a personal choice that most homeowners don’t think about until a robbery, crime or abuse takes place. It is better to be safe and not sorry. A camera is not necessarily a guarantee, but it is a commodity that will enhance safety measures.

There are many wireless security cameras without audio and these days a lot of them are disguised as common household goods. It is more advantageous to a homeowner to be equipped with a security camera than not having one. These days crime is so rampant and a camera brings that safety to the home and the homeowner.
