Be All The Rage

The gang’s out there honking their horns. You’re ready to show off your bike’s purple light and can’t wait to do so. Wait until dark and you’ll have them all drooling. Nice thought? That’s your biggest secret for the moment. Your H4 bi-Xenon HID kit has given you the edge over their Harleys, Ducatis, Augustas, and Hondas, and they don’t know it yet.

When dusk falls, you switch on your HID headlamps. Right there and then you get the admiring toots and yells. You’ve made your trusty Honda the star of the pack. Your purple headlights beam on more areas ahead on the road and you zoom ahead. You’ve got the raves and you’re all the rage, thanks to your conversion effort with your HID kit.

Your Car Can Get It Too

The HID headlamps for cars are just as cool. They are also long lasting and eat up less of you car money in the long run. Switching the lights off and on won’t work up your car battery. You can save a lot of money with smart HID headlamps. If your car is a 2000 model, it probably does not have a closed beam, which makes conversion to HID headlamps less costly, and you can do the installation yourself. But if you are not comfortable with electronics and automotives, better get a reliable mechanic to install the headlamps from your HID kit.

When choosing your new HID headlamps, get the right HID kit. You can go online and browse all the car accessory sites and compare features and prices. You can go to dealers and gather information. They will be very eager to help you.

Different Strokes from Different Kits

There are different kits for different needs. There is the D2S HID kit. This kit contains 2 HID D2S Xenon bulbs, 2 35W ballasts, and 2 steel ballast harnesses. There will be four steel screws for mounting the system. Whether you choose 9005 bulbs, the HID kit will contain the same items compatible with your bulbs.

If you are wondering about warranty, there is always something really great going on, if you know where to find them. Depending on your HID kit of choice, you can have a 2-year to a lifetime warranty. All the HID bulbs have been engineered for the best light output, have a staying power of 200 hours, and are waterproof and shockproof. You can be confident with HID headlamps when you take a spin anytime and anywhere.

Why Switch?

With a reliable dealer, you are going to get advantages aside from the swell night time look. You can have your beam corrected. Other motorists will thank you for the minimal glare and you get mileage in safety. You won’t have those worrisome aftermarket shocks.

If you compare the illumination of halogen lamps with the HID version, you will be stunned to discover that halogen lamps are outshined with the crisp lighting of HID bulbs, so have your beam pattern after conversion looked over. HID kits are worth it. You’ll own the roads in no time.
