Gouty arthritis causes back pain, since it affects the joints. Gouty arthritis is a joint disease, which inflammation causes deposits of uric (Acid in the urine) acid crystals. The acids are slightly soluble, which are present in blood and urine. The acids are produced by breakdowns of body waste known as nitrogenous matters, or substances. 

Gouty arthritis in etiology aspects emerge from hyperparathyroidism, genetics, polycythemia Vera, decreases in uric excretion, and chronic renal (Kidney) failure. 

Gouty affects the metabolic flow, as well as causes abnormal purine results of metabolism. The problem results to secretion of urates and increases in blood and uric. 

The symptoms occur from actions that affect the metabolism. The symptoms include joint pain, swelling, redness, malaise, tachycardia, elevations in skin temperature, and so on. Tophi in worst conditions affect the outer ear, ankles, and toes. 

Doctors often conduct a series of tests to find gouty. The tests include synovial analysis of fluid, hematology, and blood chemistry. 

If increases of ESR, or uric is noted Synovial fluid is tested. If the results show positive sodium urates crystal formation, thus management is planned. The doctor may start management before the tests are administered, especially if he/she suspects that gouty is present. 

Management is followed by interventions and additional assessments. Once the patient has a set diet, monitoring, lab studies, exercise, etc, the doctor moves to intervene with further complications. 

Management includes an alkaline-ash diet and low-purine. Fluid is increased, which the doctor also recommends that the patient avoid kidney beans, anchovies, sardines, liver, alcohol, and shellfish. Aspirin is prescribed, as well as NSAIDs to reduce the pain. The doctor often prescribes Motrin, Ibuprofen, Flurbiprofen, Naproxen, Piroxicam, and so on. 

The diet must be maintained, as well the patient should increase fluid intake up to three quarts daily. Once the management plan is set in motion, doctors will start to assess the patient’s integumentary rank. Additional actions are taken, including skin care. The joints are monitor to reduce edema, pain, and slowness in the range of motion. (ROM)
