Handmade Soap

A very good friend of mine makes homemade candles for a living. Last year, she took me around to many different craft fairs to help her to sell her candles. While I was there, I would walk around and look at all of the things other crafters had to offer. I found that I would often buy handmade soap from various vendors. It’s not like I needed the soap, but I would buy it anyway. Many of them are still in my closet, though I have managed to use a few of them.

I don’t know what it is about handmade soap, but perhaps it is the colors and textures that appeal to me. I also like to support crafters who want to earn extra money by selling their goods. There are a lot of people who make handmade soap, and this seems to be one of the most popular items there. There never seems to be a shortage of great things to buy, but I always end up leaving with a bag full of soap. When the holidays come around, the soaps and make great gifts.

I thought about making my own handmade soap. Once I started reading up on the processes of making really good soap, I decided it was not something I could mess with at this time. Some of the ingredients in handmade soap can be dangerous, and I don’t have an adequate workspace in which to make soap at this time. Perhaps when we own our own home, I will be able to find some space to make my own soap. I may even try my hand at candles.
