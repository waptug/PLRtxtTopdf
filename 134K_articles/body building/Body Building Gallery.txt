Body Building Gallery


When you are serious about body building, having a gallery of pictures to show off your physique can be a great way to let the world know about your passion.  When you have a body building gallery, you will get exposure in the fitness world as well as in the world in general.

There are many ways that you can display a gallery of body building pictures.  To begin with, you’ll need to get the pictures together.  Have a professional photographer take your picture in a variety of poses wearing a variety of outfits.  You’ll want to be tanned and oiled up just a bit.

When you are posing focus on flexing your muscles fully.  Have the pictures taken from different angles and different distances.  You may also want to have some pictures done outdoors in natural light where you can move about and benefit from the look sunlight will give you.

Once you have a gallery of pictures, you’ll want to display them.  The most effective and easiest way to do this is to set up a website.  You can get your own dedicated web address for around $100 to $150 per year at a variety of web hosting companies.  Web sites are easy to set up with the benefit of software like Dreamweaver or Front Page.

Once you have the site set up, get the word out.  Advertise in body building magazines, print up some business cards and give them out to everyone you know, or place an ad on your local gym’s bulletin board.  You can also register with Google Ad Words to make your site searchable and gain more traffic.

If you don’t want to go to the trouble of making your own website, there are plenty of places online where you can post your body building gallery photos.  Many of these places allow you to post pictures for free, and they are very well traveled on a daily basis.  Here are a couple of suggested sites:

* www.bodybuilding.com
* www.weightsnet.com
* www.female-bodybuilders.org
* www.getbig.com
* www.elitefitness.com

When you care enough about your body to work it to its fullest potential, it’s only natural to want to show it off.  The best way to do this is to develop your own body building gallery.  If you will be entering body building competitions, this is great exposure for you and will get your name out in the body building world.  People will start talking about you and your amazing body.  Then, they’ll flock to the forum just to see you in person.  What a great reward for all your hard work!
