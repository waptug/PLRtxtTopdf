As you would expect the top of the line spy equipment is pretty pricey, upwards of a few thousand dollars for professional quality. These professional systems usually include a portable DVR, to be able to remotely check on cameras, and multiple channel capabilities. For extra features you can spend more than $10,000 but for as little as $4,000 you can get the job done efficiently. You may not get a few of the special features but you will be able to pull of jobs, bringing in a reputation as well as an income.

A great feature that some equipment provides is a location tracker device that allows you to accurately follow a subject and retrace his location history. There are some less expensive models that will tell you where someone is, and you have to do all the tracking records by hand. 

A common spy feature is a small hidden camera that appears to be an ordinary object, a portable bug that allows you to hear in digital quality, all connected to a wireless system. The better your equipment is the more efficient you are going to be. This customer satisfaction goes a long way when it comes to proving ability. 

If you are considering becoming a professional spy you need to pay the price for the professional equipment just as you would in any other business. In some cases you have to spend the money in order to get the results you need. "
