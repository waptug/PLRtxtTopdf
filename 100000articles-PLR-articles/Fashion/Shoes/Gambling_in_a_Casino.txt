The Ball and the Wheel:
Roulette is a very simple game to learn. The object is to pick the number the ball will land on. The numbers on the wheel alternate from red to black. This allows you to also bet on what color the ball will land on and if the number will be an odd number or an even number. These 2 bets are the simplest to win and only pay out at 1 to 1. Since there are 36 numbers on the wheel not counting 0 and 00 you can also bet on if the winning number will be in the first second or third groups of 12 numbers which pays 2 to 1.

The casino make much more money from the table games then from someone sitting at a machine all day plunking in quarters. Modern slot machines are computerized; this means that the outcome of the game is predetermined. The difference between winning the jackpot and losing is the difference between hitting the button now and a thousandth of a second latter.
