}Travelers Picked Up Anywhere by Air Ambulance and Transported to Hospital of Choice
 at No Additional Charge \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Whether you
 have pre-existing medical conditions or are as healthy as a horse, you never know
 what might happen.  When you are close to home, you know just where to head in 
an emergency.  If a medical emergency should arise, you would travel to your trusted
 local hospital to receive superior medical treatment near friends and family,  
but what happens when you are away from home?\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Whether you
 are traveling a few states away or halfway around the globe, you can rest assured
 knowing that you can be transported to the hospital of your choice quickly and 
conveniently without experiencing outrageous costs.  MedjetAssist is a company that
 offers excellent service for travelers at reasonable rates.  A family can secure
 air ambulance transportation coverage while traveling over 150 miles from home 
for an annual fee of only $350.  An individual pays only $225 for a year\u8217\'92
s worth of coverage.  What a small cost for peace of mind.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 What makes
 MedjetAssist so different from other medical evacuation services?  Like other medical
 evacuation services, MedjetAssist sends an air ambulance and medical staff to pick
 you up from the hospital to transport you to another medical facility.  The difference
 lies in the details.  MedjetAssist allows the patient to determine the hospital
 of their choice as the final destination.  Most medical evacuation services require
 the transit to be deemed medically necessary.  With MedjetAssist, it does not matter
 what the reason.  MedjetAssist will be there to pick you up.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Upon hospitalization
, the nature of the injury or illness does not matter.  Most other medical evacuation
 services have specific conditions that apply for patients to be transported by 
air ambulance.  MedjetAssist is different.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 MedjetAssist
 has a global network of staff that can coordinate air ambulance transportation 
upon request from members.  The fee for such transportation is extremely expensive
 for someone who does not have coverage.  Medical transportation via air ambulance
 can cost between $10,000 to $75,000.  As a member of MedjetAssist, you will not
 be charged this enormous fee.  It is easy to see why this coverage is a good investment
.              \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 MedjetAssist
 also offers short-term coverage.  This type of coverage is perfect for someone 
planning a trip several miles away from home.  Maybe you are a homebody most of 
the time, but you have decided to spend a month away from home in a foreign country
.  You\u8217\'92ve already made the plans and purchased the tickets.  Do you need
 to pay for an entire years worth of service?  With MedjetAssist, short-term coverage
 is available.  This type of coverage starts at a mere $85.  Considering the cost
 of just one trip in an air ambulance, this service could really save a bundle of
 money.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Ask your 
travel agent about MedjetAssist service when planning your next trip away from home
.  It is comforting to know that you are protected regardless of where you travel
 around the world.  The minimal investment will save a bundle if you should ever
 need to be transported by air ambulance and evacuated to your local home hospital
.  MedjetAssist offers excellent coverage at an affordable price.\par}
