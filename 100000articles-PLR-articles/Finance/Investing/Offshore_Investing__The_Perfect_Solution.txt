Offshore investment is an expression heard often, but not necessarily understood by the masses. Here is a breakdown of the definition of the phrase and some generalizations concerning it. 

First of all, the term “offshore” indicates something being foreign or outside of the domestic territory of one of the G8. The G8 (Group of Eight) refers to the annual summit of the government heads of the eight most prominent nations in the world. These eight nations are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. Offshore investing, or alternative investing, is conducting financial business outside of the investor’s home country, which is usually one of the G8 nations. 

By having anything from a foreign bank account or credit cards to more intricate offshore financial dealings, such as trusts and multi-level investments, investors gain access to varieties of international trade. 

Many large financial institutions have offices in popular offshore locations to capitalize on the increased interest in this type of investing. Studies calculate that about half of the world’s money is offshore from the location of the money holder. This is largely due to the fact that the primary offshore investors are the world’s wealthiest individuals and corporations.

The number of offshore investors has grown rapidly in recent years due to several factors. First and foremost, the introduction of the world to the Internet has enabled people to gain knowledge and invest outside of their own region. They are no longer intimidated by offshore investing and consider it a possibility because of the instant communication between nations afforded by the Internet.

The ever-expanding diversity of investments has also attracted more buyers. These new types of investments, coupled with the jurisdiction and regulations options available through offshore banking, make it an appealing choice indeed.

With all the options out there, how can investors and brokers make the best decisions regarding their money? The Internet offers a vast source of information regarding offshore investment opportunities and probabilities. 

There are also countless financial advisors specializing in international investments. Financial institutions realize the huge business that is in offshore investments and they have made that available to their clients as well by hiring special consultants for this purpose.

Elevated taxes can be a real detraction from the accumulation of profits. The typically lower taxes of smaller countries are the biggest incentive to invest offshore, since the offshore investor is usually wealthy and living in a higher tax area, such as the United States. 

Of course, seeking higher returns on their investments is another common motive for people exploring offshore investing. Also at issue is the currency in which to keep the assets, and the strength of that currency rate. 

Traditional investment specialists may frown on offshore banking because it is less regulated and less predictable. The risk and unknown factor involved turn some would-be investors off, although many individuals that pursue offshore investments have made their fortunes by taking similar risks elsewhere. 

Reasons for choosing to invest offshore are plentiful and may involve more than just taxes and returns. Other considerations include a higher level of confidentiality due to the offshore nation’s government policies or legal protection offered by offshore investment approaches, like trusts and different kinds of corporations.
