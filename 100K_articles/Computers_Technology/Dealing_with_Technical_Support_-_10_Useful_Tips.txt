Most people who work in an office environment, buy computer products, or have a computer at home have had the “fun” experience of dealing with technical support. It’s not always the easiest, or most pleasant, experience but hopefully this article will help you make the best of the situation the next time you call. Below you will find a list of things to keep in mind the next time your computer breaks down. 

1.<b>Stay calm</b> – Don’t yell at the support person on the other end of the phone. He is there only to help and the more angry you are the less help you are going to get.

2.<b>Get to the point</b> – Ask your question or explain your situation right away. Don't beat around the bush.

3.<b>Don’t be arrogant</b> – You are calling technical support because you need help. Don’t try and be a smart guy. 

4.<b>Call for yourself</b> – Don’t call for a friend, relative, or coworker. It’s very difficult, for the person trying to help you, when you are repeating information that you got from someone else. 

5.<b>Stay at the computer</b> – Make sure you are at the computer with the problem when you call. It’s hard for someone to help you through a problem if don’t have access to the computer. 

6.<b>Record the error</b> – If you are calling about an error you saw, make sure you write it down. It’s hard for someone to help you if all you can say is “There was a box on my screen that had writing in it”.

7.<b>Find out how many people are affected</b> – The priority of your call can be greatly influenced by the amount of people it is affecting. If the problem is affecting a number of people it will probably be escalated to a higher level. 

8.<b>Be patient</b> – By default, technical support usually has certain questions they are required to ask. These are not meant to make you angry, they help in the process of solving your problem.

9.<b>Know what kind of support is offered</b> – Ask around the office before calling to see what kind of support is offered. Not all technical support centers offer “How to” help. If your support group does not offer this type of support you may have to get a coworker to help.

10.<b>*The Golden Rule*: Technical support is trying to help</b> - The reason you called, in the first place, is because you needed help with something. Try not to make it difficult for the person on the other end to help you. 

These tips aren’t just some random bunch of words I have put together. I am one of the people you get on the phone when you call technical support. I have been working in a Help Desk environment for almost two years and have heard almost every excuse, lie, and problem you can imagine. For me, it makes things much easier if the caller follows these simple rules. Technical support is made up of people too. Try and treat them as you would want to be treated and I guarantee your next experience will be much better.
