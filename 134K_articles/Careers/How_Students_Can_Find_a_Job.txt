Remember back in high school when you got your very first job? You probably drove around to every pizza, burger, and fast food joint in town, asking if they were hiring. Yeah, we all do it.

How else can we make money to supe-up our cars? It's typical to end up at some grocery store or waiting tables at the local diner. These are known as jobs for students. Most gargantuan corporations don't tend to hire 16 year olds who lack a high school diploma. In fact, this is what drives us to work hard and do well in college. After a taste of these "jobs for students," we're so anxious to move up and away from their crappy hours, and headaches. And that's not even mentioning the terrible pay. 

I can remember the first job I ever received. It was working at a video store. Not too bad considering some of the horrors out there. However, how long can you stand to work in customer service? While you may think those cubicle jobs are a bore; believe me, there is much worse. At least with the tiny office space positions, you don't have some lunatic customer screaming in your face. Once I had reached college, I looked into a variety of jobs for students. Anything from delivering Chinese food, to waiting tables, to working as a lifeguard at the local pool. Although all of these jobs worked out okay, and paid the bills, they weren't the be-all end-all to jobs for students. These days there are much more valuable resources to take advantage of. So toss that local newspaper in the trash, and stop wasting all your gas by driving around from window to window, in search of a "Help Wanted" sign. It's time to turn to everyone's favorite electronic buddy. Yes, I'm talking about your computer. Check out what the World-Wide-Web has to offer.
