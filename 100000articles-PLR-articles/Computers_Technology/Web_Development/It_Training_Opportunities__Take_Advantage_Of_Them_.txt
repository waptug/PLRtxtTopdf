The information technology field is always moving forward at an amazing pace. The IT field is an exciting field to be a part of, but you have to stay on your toes, or some of the technologies will pass you by. In my experience training opportunities in the IT field are always beneficial. Some of the opportunities are better than others, but you should never pass up a chance for training if you have time and can afford it. IT training opportunities can come in many different flavors, structured certification classes, informal round table discussions, web seminars, and even mailing lists are great sources for IT training.

Many employers will pay for different training opportunities for their IT staffs. This is definitely a good idea, because the return on investment for IT training is tremendous. Many companies prefer employees that have gone through structured certification classes, because they have an affirmation from a third party that tells them their employee is capable of performing their job correctly.

Certifications can be great to learn the basics of your job, but some of the other IT training opportunities can expand on this knowledge to let you develop yourself into a leader in your field. Informal round table discussions can be a great training opportunity, because they usually involve real world discussions that allow others to share their experiences. Other people’s experiences can be a great source of knowledge, because they can shed light on techniques that you would have never thought about on your own.

Web seminars are also a great way to obtain training. These are usually free, because they are sponsored by companies that are trying to sell their products. However if you can look past the sales pitch, you will usually find a great deal of good information about new cutting edge technologies.

The final IT training opportunity that is freely available to everyone is mailing lists. You should search online for mailing lists that interest you, because these can be a great source of information for anyone in the IT field. Plus these daily or weekly emails also help to refresh your mind by allowing you to take a break from the daily grind of your job.
