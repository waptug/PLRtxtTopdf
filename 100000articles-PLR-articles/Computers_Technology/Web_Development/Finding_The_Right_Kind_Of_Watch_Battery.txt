Keeping time nowadays can be done in a number of ways. From cell phones to computers to PDA’s, we have the accurate time right at our fingertips at any given moment. But for some, staying on schedule means the ownership of a wristwatch. And the maintenance of such a watch means the periodic replacement of the watch battery.

First introduced by Energizer in 1957, the watch battery revolutionized the way we powered our watches. No longer was it necessary to wind a watch in order to maintain its operation; the watch battery was the new face of timekeeping and the public responded by making battery-operated watches one of the most popular choices among consumers; manufacturers scrambled to keep pace.

Today, the watch battery is taken mostly for granted; its miniscule presence rarely noticed until it’s time to find a replacement. But luckily, finding a watch battery replacement is neither a pricey nor complicated procedure. For designer watches, it is always best to visit the manufacturer or an authorized dealer. For these particular brands of watches, corresponding parts are often found only through the manufacturer. In this way you can guarantee the consistency of high quality parts – including your watch battery.

For less expensive watches, a watch battery can be found in local retail stores or even in jewelry stores. They are extremely inexpensive and relatively easy to replace. Most important, however, is to ask about your watch’s battery needs when purchasing it. In this way you can be sure you know what to ask for and where to look when your watch battery needs replacing.

The added bonus of the watch battery is its ability to be used in other small pieces of equipment such as hearing aids, remote controls, and calculators – among other items. This can be extremely convenient when you need a quick and temporary watch battery replacement.
