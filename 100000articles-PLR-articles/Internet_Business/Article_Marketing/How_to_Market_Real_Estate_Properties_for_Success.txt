Gain Theoretical Experience in Real Estate Marketing.

It's always intimidating at first to do anything new and being perplexed or even a little scared and apprehensive is quite normal in the beginning.


There are plenty of resources for information about marketing approaches and, if you are new to the business, finding out a little theory will help you become confident enough to move to the next step: choosing a technique you are interested in and which matches your personality.


Don't become a victim of Paralysis Through Analysis: you can't nor should you want to know everything about every single aspect.

Don't get blocked by insecurity and simply pick one or two techniques you think you could be comfortable with and test, test, test and test some more..



Make your Real Estate Marketing Mistakes Early on.

Don't be afraid of making small mistakes: they are your surest way to success. 

It's much better to test and fail with small and affordable quantities until you finally succeed than to put your year's real estate marketing budget on a campaign you think is amazing; to find out too late it doesn't produce the expected results.





Start a marketing campaign.

Knowing where you want to go with your real estate marketing campaign is the best way to get there. Answer the following questions about you average client:

Age 

Sex

Income

Education

Interests

Favorite media



I know this sound like a waste of time and that you are willing to sell real estate to anyone,Â no matter how old or young they are.


The bad news: there is no way you can reach / sell to everyone.

The good news: you don't have to in order to be successful and you can reach a specific type of clients, perhaps the one you feel most comfortable with, if you identify what they do and how they look for their real estate. 





Get Clear, Realistic and Measurable Real Estate Marketing Objectives. 



How many leads do you need to generate per week /month/ year?

How many people does it take to get one lead?

How will you evaluate the quality of your leads?

How will you know your marketing campaign is working (or not working)?

How much can you afford to spend?





Delegate the T Word.



Technology is nothing to be afraid of, especially in real estate marketing.The most important here is to select the media that will reach the niche market you chose earlier.


Don't waste your time understanding or even worse: doing yourself, what others can do for you, for cheap and with quicker and most likely better results.


You don't have to be able to program HTML or become an SEO (Search Engine Optimization) specialist to take advantage of technology in real estate marketing, just as you don't have to be a mechanical engineer to drive your car. You are most likely not in the business of building websites or publishing 4 color pamphlets so leave it to the professionals and concentrate on what you and only you can do to move your business forward.





Make the Time.

If you follow advice number 4, you have no excuse for not taking charge of you marketing success.
