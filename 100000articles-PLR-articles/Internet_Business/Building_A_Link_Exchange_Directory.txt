Tips in organizing your link exchange directory.
 
- Ensure your main directory categories page is linked from your main page.
It's important that search engines can find it. Having properly organized link pages will provide you with strong keyword based pages. If you have a sitemap generated, include your full directory in there as well. Not only will this benefit you, but also your link exchange partner will get the proper credit for the exchange.
 
- Keep each site theme on it's own page.
Group all home-based business websites on one page, all sports websites on another, all web hosting on it's own, etc… 
 
- Keep the pages short. 
It is bad practice to put 100++ links on a page. Ideally the maximum amount of reciprocal links on one page should be 20 and link to additional pages as needed.
 
- Modify your Meta tags
Set your Meta tags to reflect the contents of that link page
 
- Always link back to your main site
On each link exchange page ensure you have a keyword-based text link back to your main URL. If someone finds your website through a search engine based on a page from your directory, you will want them to visit your main page ;-) Keep your link back to your main page in a prominent place within your directory pages.
