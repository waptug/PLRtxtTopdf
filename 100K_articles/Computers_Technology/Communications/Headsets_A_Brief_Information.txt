Everyone seems to have gotten busier and everyone also seems to have learned to multitask better. If you do one thing at a time these days there’s something drastically wrong with you. Everyone drives and talks on the phone. People at work talk on the phone and walk around their office. Everyone has to be doing something and something else at the same time.

Computer headsets are great for not having everyone around you hear everything that is going on. Through our computers we can listen to music, talk on the phone and videoconference. Using a headset while on the computer allows you to work and not disturb the people around you and keep your information private so it is not blaring over the speakers.

Telephone headsets have become more popular since the cellular phone was invented. Certain states have laws that you cannot talk on the phone while driving. Headsets attached to phones allow the busy individual who must talk on the phone while driving, to continue to do so and not endanger the people around them. The headset for the phone also allows individuals to travel while talking.

MP3 headsets or musical headsets are designed for the avid music listener or the hardcore athlete. Headsets for the music listening crowd have gotten smaller and smaller as the devices to play the music has gotten smaller and smaller too. There are the headsets that go over the head like a hair band, ones that go behind the head and still sit over the ears, and ones that sit right inside the ear. Depending on your activity level depends on the appropriate headset for you.
 
As mentioned there are various styles of headsets. Cordless headsets do exist but they cannot all be used with a cordless phone. Purchasing a headset is a very personal decision and if you can, see if you can try them on before actually purchasing it. 

The ear on a human being is a unique design to everyone. An earpiece that just sits in the ear, will not sit the same in yours, as it will your friends or spouses ear. If you wear glasses, you’ll need to get a very thin earpiece and headset. You can even get one that clips onto the frame of your glasses and then sits comfortably inside the ear. There are headsets that have just earpieces that sit in the ear, but they also have a sort of clip that sits around the ear for added stability. And then there is the classic style that sits over the head and has a padded earpiece attached to either side and rests over each ear. 

Whenever wearing a headset it is important to remember that you should keep the volume at a comfortable level. When listening to music it is not necessary to listen to it full blast over your ears – this could impair your hearing after prolonged use at a higher volume level.
