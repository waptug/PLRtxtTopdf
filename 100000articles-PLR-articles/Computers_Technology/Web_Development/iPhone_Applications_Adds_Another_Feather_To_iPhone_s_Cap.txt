iphone applications are mostly websites that can be best viewed and only accessed on the iphone. Categories of applications are so many that owners are sure to get exactly what they need and want. There are apps for communication, games, media controllers, organization, travel, business, financial, magazines, movies, news, religion, shopping, sports, tools, video, and more.

Developers who create iphone applications must make their software run under Safari since Apple is using Safari as the main web browser. The developers must also consider hosting the iphone applications or website on their own servers. Moreover, the application must maintain the platform’s look and feel, as well as, make it customizable as reported. Steve Jobs even said in a statement, that only a working knowledge of the web standards and software creations will be needed to make interesting iphone applications.
