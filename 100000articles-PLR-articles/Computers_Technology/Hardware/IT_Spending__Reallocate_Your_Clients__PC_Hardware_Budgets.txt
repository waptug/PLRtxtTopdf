If your clients’ recent financial results have been so spectacular that they feel now is the time to make significant technology investments in their companies, consider the following alternatives to solely devoting their IT spending to PC hardware purchases.

Influencing What Your Clients Do with Budget Surpluses

Think about encouraging clients to reallocate the surplus funds for IT spending on something else technology-related that they really need. 

This may be end user or administrator training, so they can get more out of their PC hardware, software and networking investments. Planned wisely, training will do wonders to improve system uptime, reduce repetitive help desk calls and boost productivity. 

Offer Training to Your Clients

Whenever feasible, make sure your company provides this kind of formal or informal one-on-one training. Otherwise, you may be leaving some really easy money on the table, exposing your clients users to potentially conflicting information and opening up your primo client accounts for poaching.

Look at Their Connection Speeds

Now may be a good time for your clients to upgrade their Internet access to boost performance and dependability. How your clients finagle their IT spending is a very individualized decision.

Encourage them to think big picture and don’t be afraid to recommend that they break tradition if it makes sense for their intermediate and long-term business needs.
