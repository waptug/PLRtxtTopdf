After purchasing Photo Shop software, it is but natural to be excited to learn more about how you can take advantage of this popular graphic editor. Despite the availability of a basic tutorial on the mechanics of using Photo Shop in the CD software, you most likely would want to have more advanced and technical understanding of the product. After seeing enhanced pictures and creative crafts made by such software on the Internet or from the collection of your friends and family, you will probably want to immediately be able to have the necessary skills to do more advanced media formats and digital files using that software.

You really do not have to spend a penny for a more in-depth Photo Shop tutorial. There are many websites on the Internet that provides several downloadable files that will help teach you the nitty-gritty of the software. However, it can be a daunting task to check each and every website that you encounter on the Net that has a free tutorial for the said software. 

Moreover, not all existing information on the World Wide Web is reliable. You might find some website that are wanting and does not provide appropriate data. Therefore, you need to check the files that you are going to download and use. Below are some important things you need to know in choosing the suitable Photo Shop tutorial for you:

Check the source

As mentioned earlier, not all data that is available on the World Wide Web is reliable. Thus, you must carefully check the source that you are going to use. Although you are not paying anything for the tutorial, you would not want to waste time and resources in downloading files that are not complete and correct. Thus, you will save much time if you check the source first and the credibility of the website that you are going to use to learn more about how to fully take advantage of the graphic editor tool you just bought.

Easy to understand

If the free Photo Shop tutorial that you find on the World Wide Web uses computer or technical jargon, you might not able to learn much from it, especially if your knowledge on computers and the software is just limited. It is wise to stick to tutorials that use conversational tones and easy to understand vocabulary. Moreover, a document or lesson that is too technical might sound boring. 

Suitable to your knowledge level of the product

It is best to start your tutorial from the very basic to the more advanced. Start looking for a document that teaches you the fundamentals of the software first, before you go on more technical and complicated matters. On the other hand, if you already have a good grasp of Photo Shop, it would be just a waste of time if you still undergo the basic training.

For those who have specific problems or would want to know about certain topics, you will find some websites that provide tutorial per action or topic. For example, if you want to learn more about retouching photographs, you could just access the files that are about how to use retouch tools.

Provides examples or screen shots 

For people who do not know computer terms, it would better if the free Photo Shop tutorial that they will use have screen shots that will help learners of the software what icons they need access and where it is located.
