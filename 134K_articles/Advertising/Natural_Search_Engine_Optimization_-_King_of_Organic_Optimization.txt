With the advent of internet, we have seen the explosion of businesses online.  You may own an off line business and wish to take it online.  The basic principle of online and off line businesses is the same.  You do hear stories of people making it big all the time on the internet. Always take these stories with a pinch of salt, and be prepared to work hard and put in the effort required to make your online business successful. 

There are certain advantages of an online business, one of them being the numerous marketing opportunities.  There are several tools that help in internet marketing, including natural SEO or natural search engine optimization.  Not all of them need loads of money, so you don’t have to worry on that front.  Some of these tools are easily available and definitely better than many off line business marketing tools. 

Natural SEO is nothing but natural methods used for marketing against the sponsored or purchased methods. Natural SEO primarily is of two types, the off page SEO and the on page SEO.  

The least important of the two natural SEO techniques is the on page natural SEO, it is just the basic kind of SEO performed on the web page itself.  Here, the website owner needs to take care of optimizing the Title, Keywords, Content, and Description, making sure that when the search engines check the web page, they are convinced that the keywords provided are relevant with the content provided in the web page. 

The more important natural SEO method is the off page SEO, which is performed at some other region other than the web page.  One of the ways of off page natural SEO is inbound links to the web page from pages that have the similar keywords related to the niche of your website.  When the search engines see several such inbound links from various sites in the same niche and relevant keywords, they assume that your webpage is being seen by other websites as being a contender for the particular keywords.

The natural SEO methods cost no money, whether it is submitting articles to various directories or posting on blogs or even getting links back from other websites, unlike other methods of SEO such as Pay per Click, which is paid traffic.  Paid traffic is only limited to what you pay for.  The minute your account is out of money, you’re PPC ads stop and with it stops the traffic, unlike natural SEO that continues to work.  

Many people are of the wrong notion that just paying for SEO gets them results and they won’t have to work on optimizing their site.  SEO experts believe that paid advertising is just not enough. Just because you have paid for it, it does not mean that this sort of promotion will take care of your requirements.

The main thing is that if you are spending money for paid advertising, you may not have a site that is search engine optimized.  The entire purpose of SEO is to be able to find methods of natural SEO that help your site to rank high in the search engines.
