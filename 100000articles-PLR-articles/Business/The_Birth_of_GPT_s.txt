Article Body:
Our economy is built on advertising, which is becoming increasingly more problematic. Corporations are spending billions of dollars annually on advertising methods that are no longer effective. Eighty percent of all US homes now own Tivo, where skipping through the commercials is just a push of a button away. Most new cars are now being delivered with (commercial free) Satellite Radio's already installed. New, stricter laws involving telemarketing are continually being put into place and the rising cost of stamps are making direct mail advertising cost prohibitive. Traditional means of advertising are becoming progressively more ineffective.

So what's an advertiser to do? In these economically challenging times more and more people are flooding the internet daily, looking for ways to earn money to either supplement their income or replace it. Family is (thankfully) becoming the cornerstone of our lives once again. The age of "you can have it all, family AND the career" and "the children just need quality time, not quantity" has drawn to a close. In today's world mom's want to stay home and raise their children. Dads are quitting high pressure, long work-day jobs. They are trading them in for lower income jobs then looking for ways to supplement their salary or replace it altogether so they can spend more time with their families. As this trend continues to evolve, corporations have begun to stand up and take notice.

Throughout history marketing agencies have kept a continual eye out for rising trends, so it's no wonder that this particular trend has caught their attention. Advertisers have found a way to capitalize on this media enriched trend of people looking to earn money on the internet. PR firms will tell you that the best way to advertise any product or service is to capture your target audiences attention. This is best accomplished by using either humor or incentives. Companies want you to view their advertisements and the more enjoyable this experience is, the more people will be willing to view them. On one hand companies need exposure to their advertisements, on the other hand people want to earn money from home over the internet… Are you starting to get the picture here? What better way to advertise than to find a way to pay the 'advertisee' to try their products and services? Hence, the GPT sites were born.

What are GPT sites? GPT stand for Get Paid To, as in Get Paid To take surveys or try new products or services. Instead of spending all of that advertising revenue on the old, more traditional media (television, radio and print), advertisers are now allocating more and more of their advertising budget towards internet advertising. GPT sites are basically the middle man that introduces the advertiser to the advertisee.

Advertisers pay GPT site owners to deliver leads to them. They are looking for people to read about their product, give their opinions about their products and try their products and / or services. That's where the advertisee comes in. The GPT site owners find leads to connect with the advertisers. They accomplish this by paying a large percentage of their earnings from the advertiser to the leads they supply them with.

GPT sites typically host a variety of offers on their webpages, including free offers, surveys, service and product trials, paid to read emails, and cash-back shopping. Earning money on these sites is not only simple, it's actually very lucrative. This is how it works; You sign up at the GPT site, once logged in you'll find a list of offers. Most GPT sites organize their offers in categories, either freebies or paid trial offers. Freebie offers are 100% free and do not require a credit card. These are usually surveys to fill out, a request for more information about a home business opportunity, or signing up for a newsletter. They pay anywhere from .40 cents to $3. Trial offers typically do require a credit card, but are far more lucrative. Some trial offers don't actually cost anything (unless you fail to cancel by the end of your trial period). Others cost anywhere from $1 to $5 for paid trials or shipping and handling charges. The profit margin on these types of offers is very high, paying anywhere between $10 and $30, occasionally more. Once you have completed an offer you simply mark it as complete using the link provided. Depending on the offer, your account will be credited anywhere from a few minutes to a few days. Most GPT sites pay monthly, however there are a few that do pay daily or weekly.
