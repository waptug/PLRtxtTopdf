Well, I have heard plenty of talk about Satellite TV for PC that perfectly turned your PC into a satellite TV for free. Growing up, I have always thought how amazing it would be to watch all of my favorite Satellite TV channels for free, but I used to think it was too good to be true so I ended up never wanting it or trying it.

However, recently I was talking to a relative of mine, Carl; he told me he found a website that was selling the satellite TV for PC service for a one time payment of $49.95. He was currently paying $90.00 or sometimes more per month for his Satellite TV service so he decided to try and give this a try.

To his surprise and mine (when he let me know) it was true! The best part of all there were no hidden fees and only a one time charge.

1. Spyware and Adware software was ran after installation and nothing was found on his PC after this program was installed.

2. There was no extra hardware required such has satellite dishes, TV cards, or paying for someone to come out and install your Dish.

3. It is 100% legal guaranteed. You are not breaking any laws whatsoever by buying this program to view these stations. The program makes sure the networks shown have given them permission to show their programs via the Satellite TV’s network.

4. It truly was just a one time payment of only $49.95 for a lifetime subscription. I was very astounded that for only $50 you can view so many channels without a subscription.

Carl now can watch over 3000 channels for free with no extra payments required and canceled his monthly Satellite TV the next day.

Because Carl had a great experience and him being a family member was enough to convince me to by my own Satellite TV for my PC. I now have over 3000 Satellite channels that I can watch for free forever and watch them anywhere in the World. I love going to my local coffee shop and watching countless hours of TV. I am very hard to impress, but I was beyond doubt that the whole process worked and was so easy to set up.

If any of you are questioning whether or not to get Satellite TV for PC for yourself, I can only give you positive feedback on my experience with it and it has my 100% recommendation.

It makes a great gift also for the holidays which are right around the corner!

I’d definitely consider Satellite TV to be at the top of my list for any movie, sports, news, or avid TV viewer. I mean, how sweet would it be for them to be able to simply sit in their computer chair and view entertainment from all over the world via their computer? The Satellite TV program will honestly be my gift to many of my relatives, aunts, and uncles this holiday season.
