It is amazing how important games are for children to learn. Psychologists have known this for a long time, but many teachers still fail to pay notice. The fact is, children learn by playing. Not only do they learn their social skills, language, and other basic skills, but they can learn academics subjects as well. I work as a tutor for severely learning disabled students. Many of them can hardly read at all. A lot of people are surprised by how often we use word scramble games, but we use them all the time! The kids love them!

For many students, word puzzle games are the best way for them to get going. They get excited about winning, and love the fact that they are being challenged. Although word scramble games aren't right for all situations, if the students are comfortable with each other, they can be very useful. Nonetheless, care should be exercised when using a word scramble game. Many students are really hyper sensitive about how far behind they have fallen in their reading. 

I had one young boy who was playing word scramble games with one of his classmates. They both came to the tutoring center, you see, and they both had similar problems. The classmate, however, was much better at word scramble games. He he was beating my students. I thought it was alright, but all of a sudden the little boy started crying. He felt so bad about not being able to keep up with his friend that it brought him to tears. It was a hard lesson for both of us. I felt terrible about it for weeks afterwards.

That is why it is so much fun for me to play a word scramble game with my friends and family. When I play a word puzzle game at home, I don't have to worry about hurting someones feelings. We all enjoy word scramble games, and all of us are pretty good at them. That means that there is no shame and embarrassment. When one of us makes a mistake in one of the word scramble games, they are able to laugh it off very easily. It gives me a chance to play competitively, too. When I'm playing word scramble games at work, you see, I have to let the kids win almost all of the time. When I play at home, however, it is a ruthless, take no prisoners game!
