The current models of Olympus digital cameras allow a person more freedom and flexibility than before. But before you decide on an Olympus digital camera model, you must think about the types of photographs you want to take.

For taking shots like sports shots or any pictures of fast moving subjects you would need to get a camera with a large optical zoom like the 10X. There are a number of Olympus models under the Ultra zoom series that would fit your specifications. The camera would also need to be able to take several pictures in a few seconds to give you a better chance of catching the right shot. It is best to get a camera that can take at least 1.5 shots every second; this is double the amount of shots you would have obtained under normal circumstances.

When taking shots indoors, it is important to get the settings right. The Olympus digital camera with manual settings is a better choice in this situation. There is an eternal flash and you are able to manipulate the controls with features such as aperture, white balance setting and shutter speed.

If you are out on vacation with the family, having a barbeque or engaging in any other recreational activity, the portable point and shoot camera is your best choice. These models allow a person to take a good picture with as little fuss as possible and they are the most affordable of all the cameras on the market.

You should also think about the size of the camera you are about to buy. This can ranges from pocket size to something you need to carry in a bag. Here is a breakdown of the range of Olympus digital camera sizes.

• The D-series digital camera weighs about five ounces and is the size of a wallet.

• The Stylus digital camera is thinner than the D-series but its weight and size are the same.

• The C-series digital camera won’t fit in a pocket but it is still portable

• The digital SLR weighs over a pound and is the biggest Olympus digital camera on the market.
