It will be the first satellite to be launched in INSAT-4 series. It carries 12 high power Ku-band transponders to meet the requirement of direct-to-home (DTH) television services apart from 12C-band transponders to augment the INSAT capacity for communication and DTH services. 
Weighing 3,080 kg at lift-off, INSAT-4A is the heaviest satellite of the Indian Space Agency till date.
INSAT will have about 225 active transponders in various frequency bands by 2007, which can cater to the demand up to 11 GBPS capacity with present days technology. Along with INSAT-4A, which is the 12th satellite for which ISRO has chosen the European launcher, Ariane Placed MSG-2 weather satellite for the European Organization EUmetsat into the orbit.

Tata-sky, the joint venture of the Tatas and Rupert Murdoch-owned STAR group, has booked all the Ku-band transponders on the Rs. 350 crore satellite, designed, built Indian Space Research Organization. ISRO paid an additional USD 50 million to Ariane Space, the European Commercial Launch Service provider as launch cost. ISRO has already contracted to Ariane space the launch of INSAT-4B, which will carry 12 Ku band and 12 12 C band transponders, would be orbited by India's own Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV).
