<b>Different Kinds of Pharmacist Jobs</b>

Pharmacists are needed wherever medicines are prepared or dispensed. Even storage of medicines should be under their supervision. The pharmacist is trained to dispense the correct dosages of medicines meeting the correct standards of purity. Non-pharmacists can make incorrect decisions on these matters, leading to serious health consequences, including danger to life.

So who stores, prepares and dispenses medicines?<ul>
 <li>Retail Chemists selling prescription and over the counter drugs to the public</li>
 <li>Hospitals and Clinics dispensing medicines to their patients</li>
 <li>Healthcare and infusion facilities providing medication services at home or nursing homes</li>
 <li>Government and community centers offering healthcare and medication services</li>
 <li>Armed services that have their own medical departments and services</li>
</ul>

All the above establishments will thus need the services of qualified pharmacists.

Pharmacists are also needed to research and develop drugs for pharmaceutical companies, and in their sales and marketing departments. Thus the pharmaceutical manufacturers are a major employer of pharmacists.

Pharmacists work as retail pharmacists, clinical pharmacists, IV pharmacists, pharmacy managers, drug research scientists and so on. When dealing with the public, they have to be more than just medicine dispensers. They have to provide advice on the correct usage of the medicines. They might also be called upon to consult with healthcare professionals. Pharmacists thus need an ethical attitude and good communications skills in addition to technical know-how.

<b>How Do You Become a Pharmacist?</b>

It requires years of training to become a licensed pharmacist.

You start with about two years of study at college level in chemistry, biology, physics and other science subjects. Even after this study, you might be required to take a Pharmacy Colleges Admissions Test before you are accepted into a college of pharmacy.

Pharmacy colleges typically offer 6 year and 5 year curriculum equipping the pharmacist in formulating, preparing and dispensing medicines, as well as in other areas such as professional ethics, communicating with patients and healthcare professionals and managing a pharmacy practice.

Before obtaining the license to practice, the pharmacist will also have to undergo internship under a licensed pharmacist, and pass a state examination.

Becoming a pharmacist is thus a painstaking process, and it is no wonder that there are more pharmacist jobs going round than pharmacists seeking jobs!

The pharmacist jobs also require you to be available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Illnesses requiring medication do not go home after "duty hours" (much as we might wish them to do)!

<b>The Pharmacist</b>

Pharmacists are trusted persons whom patients and healthcare professionals consult. They have access to confidential information about patients. Naturally, they need to be persons who can be trusted to behave ethically and considerately.

If you meet the bill, pharmacist jobs will come looking for you!
