Article Body:
Only one half day left of my conference.  I can hardly wait for this thing to be over and I can leave this town for a while. 

One amusing story to share.  While I was in the men's room today, I took my position at the urinal.  As I was performing standard urinal procedure, I noticed out of the corner of my eye a man talking to another man about 5 urninals down.  He stood right next to the man, and started talking while emptying the tank.  It was obvious they had a solid business relationship.

As they exchanged greetings the man in mid-pee reached over and shook the other man's hand!  WHOA!  TIMEOUT!  3 cardinal rules of standard mens room procedure had been broken!

1.  Failure to utlize the inbetween urninal.  If there are a bank of pee stalls, be kind and position yourself at LEAST one urninal from your fellow urniner. 

2.  Direct Eye Contact.  Never, I mean never make eye contact with a fellow uriner.  You have already established a male bond by proxy because you pee standing up.  Eyes front, cowboy.

3.  Hand to hand contact in mid procedure.  NO!  should that man have put his had out in a kindly handshaky gesture, I would have told him, (and you should too), "Sorry, sir, but round these parts we practice a little bit of hand sanatizing.  Wash em up good, with soap, dry em off,  then we can shake."  I know I keep my no-no zone in a mighty fine and clean condition, but I don't know about my fellow man.

I hope this has been a valuable refresher course in men restroom behavior.
