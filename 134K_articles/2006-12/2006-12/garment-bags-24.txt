Garment Bag

I don’t have a lot of use for the garment bag, but when I do need one, I want to make sure I’m not getting something that is going to tear. When my wedding dress was being brought from the house to the church, the bag ripped and my dress got grease on it. The grease came out, luckily, but it never would have happened if the bridal store that sold me the dress would have given me a good bag rather than the cheap one they threw on there at the last minute.

I bought my dress at a deep discount, but that doesn’t mean they should have given me a good garment bag to go over it. It should be something they do for anyone who buys a dress. Even a good disposable garment bag does not cost that much, and I would have even paid more for a better one if I had thought about it. I didn’t though, as I was in the middle of planning my wedding, and the state of the bag around my dress didn’t come up in my mind as something that I had to worry about. I thought it would be fine.

If you have something like a wedding or perhaps a prom dress, make sure you get a good garment bag to protect it, even if you have to buy it separately. It might be the best thing you can do to save your dress from a stain or a rip at the wrong moment. A good garment bag should also be put over a suit or tuxedo, even if you think you are only going ten miles with it to wear it right away. If you are renting something, it is even more important that you keep it safe and clean.

If you can find an acid free type of garment bag, it might be something that you can safely keep a special item in for a while, though I wouldn’t rely on it for long-term storage. This type of garment bag will keep your stuff in good shape until you can get it somewhere to be properly preserved, if this is what you are going to do. Many brides like to save their wedding dresses just incase they someday have a daughter who might like to wear it, and a good garment bag will help keep it in good shape.
