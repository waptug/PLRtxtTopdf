Air Ambulance and Transported to Any Hospital of Choice
 
Whether you have pre-existing medical conditions or are as healthy as a horse, you never know what might happen.  When you are close to home, you know just where to head in an emergency.  If a medical emergency should arise, you would travel to your trusted local hospital to receive superior medical treatment near friends and family,  but what happens when you are away from home?

Whether you are traveling a few states away or halfway around the globe, you can rest assured knowing that you can be transported to the hospital of your choice quickly and conveniently without experiencing outrageous costs.  MedjetAssist is a company that offers excellent service for travelers at reasonable rates.  A family can secure air ambulance transportation coverage while traveling over 150 miles from home for an annual fee of only $350.  An individual pays only $225 for a year's worth of coverage.  What a small cost for peace of mind.  

What makes MedjetAssist so different from other medical evacuation services?  Like other medical evacuation services, MedjetAssist sends an air ambulance and medical staff to pick you up from the hospital to transport you to another medical facility.  The difference lies in the details.  MedjetAssist allows the patient to determine the hospital of their choice as the final destination.  Most medical evacuation services require the transit to be deemed medically necessary.  With MedjetAssist, it does not matter what the reason.  MedjetAssist will be there to pick you up.

Upon hospitalization, the nature of the injury or illness does not matter.  Most other medical evacuation services have specific conditions that apply for patients to be transported by air ambulance.  MedjetAssist is different.

MedjetAssist has a global network of staff that can coordinate air ambulance transportation upon request from members.  The fee for such transportation is extremely expensive for someone who does not have coverage.  Medical transportation via air ambulance can cost between $10,000 to $75,000.  As a member of MedjetAssist, you will not be charged this enormous fee.  It is easy to see why this coverage is a good investment.              

MedjetAssist also offers short-term coverage.  This type of coverage is perfect for someone planning a trip several miles away from home.  Maybe you are a homebody most of the time, but you have decided to spend a month away from home in a foreign country.  You've already made the plans and purchased the tickets.  Do you need to pay for an entire years worth of service?  With MedjetAssist, short-term coverage is available.  This type of coverage starts at a mere $85.  Considering the cost of just one trip in an air ambulance, this service could really save a bundle of money.

Ask your travel agent about MedjetAssist service when planning your next trip away from home.  It is comforting to know that you are protected regardless of where you travel around the world.  The minimal investment will save a bundle if you should ever need to be transported by air ambulance and evacuated to your local home hospital.  MedjetAssist offers excellent coverage at an affordable price.
