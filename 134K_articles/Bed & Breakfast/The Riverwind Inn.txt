
The Riverwind Inn


Nestled in the scenic lower Connecticut River valley is The Riverwind Inn. Even before stepping inside you will feel like you have stepped into our colonial past. From its wrap around porch to the vine covered railings you almost expect to see the emergence of the original patriots. Let's step inside to see what our gracious hosts have to offer us.

Ascending the stairs to the third floor we come to the aptly named Moonlit Suite. With a queen sized bed there is also a full sized bed in an alcove for that occasional additional guest. There is even a sitting room and a double Jacuzzi to add to the comforts. With its mahogany four-poster bed and colonial furnishings the Champagne and Roses suite is ideal for the romantic side. 

If your tastes run towards the classics, then Zelda's room is truly taken from The Great Gatsby. This two-room suite features a brass queen sized bed. The décor of rose hearts within a field of blue is found in the Hearts and Flowers suite and is complete with the four-poster bed. Echoing our puritan beginnings, twin four-poster double beds accent the Quilt room. 

On the first floor we find the Willow Room with its white iron and brass queen sized bed. Truly American is the Smithfield Suite with its red, white and blue quilt on the high converted rope double bed. With wallpaper by Raymond Waites and a collection of cottage country pine, the Harlow Suite is simple elegance. The headboard of the queen-sized bed has painted panel insets that echo the graceful floral motif of each corner of the room. 

The Riverwind Inn provides a full complimentary country breakfast to jumpstart your day of shopping and sightseeing. Located amid some of the most historic parts of New England, the shops abound in the many small villages of the area. There is also some very excellent theater nearby.
