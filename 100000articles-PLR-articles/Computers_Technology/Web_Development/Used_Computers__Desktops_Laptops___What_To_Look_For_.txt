Nowadays desktops and laptops are much more durable and dependable that they were just five years ago. Therefore, buying a used or refurbished computer is becoming more of a trend.

* Compare the price of the new model in the market with what price your buying your used computer, try to get the best bargain. i.e. a two year old computer should not be bought for more than half of its original price.

* Check if the computer is outdated (if out of production it is difficult to get spare parts)

* Is the operating system current (Windows Vista/Windows Xp). Earlier versions probably run slower (windows 2000) and would not be advisable unless your needs are limited (i.e. web surfing, Word...). In any event, stay away with computers running on Windows 98 (granted you don't find many anymore). Also be aware of Windows Vista. Many users are reverting back to XP and that is even more obvious in the corporate world. Why? Vista looks nice but doesn’t bring many technical improvements; therefore IT managers are not willing to implement something new when what they have works just fine. Some domestic users just don’t like the new way of navigation within the Vista Operating System.

* Check if the configuration of the computer you are buying is good.

* Check the speed of the processor. If possible start the computer and see how long it takes to fully turn on. If its slow just turning on, imagine the lack of speed once you start adding software..

Additional Tips for laptops

* Is the battery life good? (search for the computers with a very good battery backup).

* Check for the screen size of the computer your buying and see to it that it is not exceeding the Normal (normally the screen size should be between 15-17). Less than that generally translates in older computers and increases the chance of age failure. Once the screen breaks, you are often better of changing the whole computer.

* Review the connectivity of the computer (Network, USB, Video, Audio…) look to it that it has a good connectivity including wireless.

* Check out the weight. Ensure the computer is light enough for you to carry.
