Children and adults alike enjoy magical shows. Magical presentations are among the most popular past times among people of all ages, especially those who are fond of seeing folks who are clever in manipulating objects or controlling natural events.

Magicians, one who is skilled in performing optical illusion or sleight of hand, are particularly clever in performing amazing tricks. These very same tricks astound people and keep them from coming back. 

There are several ways by which you experience the joy of this entertainment. You can either visit a nearby circus which are either permanent or mobile, and or with your friends who are gifted with this wonderful craft. 

Magic Tricks

The very core of magic display is the exhibition of tricks. All tricks are done by using objects which either take the form of an animal or are turn into something spectacular. 

Humans can also become subjects for performing tricks although current federal laws limit the use of human subjects in the performance of magic tricks. 

Although magic tricks make up the most magic exposition, there are those that perform magic using no other objects but themselves. 

Famous magicians of yesteryears such as Harry Houdini or Doug Henning mostly make use of material accessories in the performance of their magic tricks. 

They make use of illusions out of the material (hat, baton, handkerchief, flowers, paper, etc.) they use which aim to amaze and mystify audience.

Even more startling is the event when other famous magicians perceivably vanish structures such the Statue of Liberty, Taj Mahal and the Space Shuttle. In a similar event, Harry Hudoini apparently made a huge elephant disappear in front of a large audience. 

Modern Magic

Modern illusionists (magicians) are bolder compared with previous practitioners. Some worth mentioning are Jeff Sheridan, Franko B and the most famous David Blaine.

David Blaine rose to popularity due to the performance of outstanding, yet bold acts. He has performed levitation, animate dead insects, baffling illusions, among others. 

Today’s magicians virtually abandoned the usual magic production: an illusionist pull a rabbit out of a black, empty hat, a glass of water disappear as it is maneuvered across a board, and pour coins from an empty bottle. 

Current practice includes exhibition and outrageous production like being stuck in the ice for hours with no interruptions. 

Aside from the aforementioned activities, the joy of magic is also incorporated in activities related to birthday parties, education programs, corporate events, and youth groups.
