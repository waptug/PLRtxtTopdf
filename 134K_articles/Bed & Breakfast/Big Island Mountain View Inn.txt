Big Island Mountain View Inn


The surf and sand may define Hawaii, but it was the volcano's that created these paradise islands. The largest of the islands also has the longest name of its resort, Big Island Hawaii Bed and Breakfast Mountain View Inn. We are stopping at a four-acre garden and fishpond estate in full view of Mauna Kea, the tallest mountain in the world. 

In this most tranquil setting are some of the worlds most exotic plants and flowers. Native to the islands are Ohia and rose apple trees and rivaling the fragrant magnolias of the east we find heliconia, ginger and anthuriums. Even the suites are a reminder of the flora of the region.

Our first stop is in the Cherry Blossom Suite. The new side room addition comes complete with coffeemaker and complimentary native Kona coffee. As would be expected, this room overlooks the Cherry Blossom tree as well as the fishpond and estate garden. A colorful quilt covers the king sized bed and a matching one is on the twin bed/sofa.  

The red and burgundy décor of  the Heliconia suite is reminiscent of the native flowers and has a view of the heliconia flower nursery. Enjoy your morning coffee in deep padded chairs around the glass top table. Even with the king sized bed there is still enough room for just relaxing. 

A comfortable queen sized bed is the centerpiece of the Lehua room. This most calming room also offers a tranquil view of the side garden. If your sleeping preference runs more to twin beds then the plumeria room is for you. This is a bright and airy room with a beautiful view of the side garden.

Enhance your stay by visiting the art studio home of Jane and Linus Chao. Stroll through the gardens or just select your favorite romance novel and have a seat in the gazebo.
