Spend a few minutes surfing the net for information on Chinese tattoos and you will quickly notice a recurring theme warning the would be tattoo recipient to ensure they know someone reliable who can accurately translate the meaning before they just go ahead a slap one on. There is even an entire blog dedicated to the misuse of these characters. Makes you wonder about all the times you wondered into a tattoo artist's workshop and flipped through the hundreds of Chinese tattoos available looking for that perfect one which symbolized your life on this planet.

Anyone who has ever thought of getting a tattoo has considered the option of a Chinese tattoo or for that matter a Korean or Japanese tattoo. Their mystery, sleek design and hidden meanings draw on our curiosity like moths to a flame. We picture friends and strangers asking with keen interest about our decision behind such a choice, which may even lead some people to create elaborate stories about their own life.

There is an endless mythical history in Asian cultures, it's no wonder Westerners are drawn to these types of tattoos, Chinese designs being the most popular and sort after around the world. Part of the interest, one would guess, is how unique each character seems and so the chances of someone else having the same one is unlikely. The fact that they also look cool doesn't hurt either.

Making the perfect, meaningful choice

Chinese tattoos are available in many different designs because the language is made up of thousands of characters rather than the few letters in the English alphabet. It may not be necessary to say it but if you choose to get a permanent tattoo, Chinese or not, it is exactly that, permanent. It is certainly not a decision to be taken lightly or one you should be making impulsively. 

If it is a story you are looking for then take the time to talk with a friend who knows some Asian history and who understands the culture and language. It would be in your best interest before getting your Chinese tattoo, to do as much research as possible. Imagine the sheer horror of having a Chinese symbol tattooed on your arm or the small of your back only to find out it has some perverse or trivial meaning when you thought it actually meant something along the lines of love, peace or hope. 

One of the ways to avoid this could be to decide on a word or phrase or even your name you would like to get a Chinese tattoo of and get it translated into characters or symbols. This will ensure accuracy and of course uniqueness.

The Chinese culture has evolved over thousands and thousands of years and such deserves the respect of a little forethought when considering a Chinese tattoo rather than a decision based on whether your favorite celebrity has one or not.
