Did you notice the title for this article?

Of course, it's a headline. That's right and it uses a shop-worn classic format which still continues to amaze me with its power. Just 2 simple words...

"How To..." Stick with me on this, I know it sounds too easy.

The simple, lowly "How to" headline is still tops in my book for simplicity and effectiveness. You really cannot go wrong with it. The 'how to' headline is so versatile. You can follow it with several benefits, a question, an offer, almost anything - and it works great!

In fact, using the 'how to' formula is one of the best places to start when writing headlines because it forces you to think of what your product/service actually does for the person.

Here are a couple of winning examples to get your juices flowing:

Now here are a few "How To.." headlines you can plug-in and use right away when brainstorming:

Even just adding the word "how" in front of a headline gives it an additional appeal. Compare these 2 examples:

Which one is more compelling? I think you'll agree #2 does the trick. And that one is a winning headline used over and over.

Okay, but maybe the tried and true "how to" is too boring for you. No problem! Spice it up by adding a little something before the 'how to'

Here's HOW TO...
