Article Body:
Infomercials have been around for along time. Have you ever caught yourself glued to the TV watching and listening to information on a new TV product? We have all seen these ads and I am sure most of us have some of these products in our homes. I know I have several. Wow, will that really clean my floors and make them look new again? Use water to steam away all those germs. Only five minutes a day and you will lose weight! How can you not want to try these products? Only $19.99 or 5 easy installments of $29.99. 

A number of celebrities endorse these products. One product that has been around for awhile is The Thighmaster endorsed by Suzanne Somers. She also endorses other exercise machines such as torso track, beauty products and even appliances. Suzanne has made a real impression in infomercial world. 

Celebrities definitely help these products to sell. These are people we can relate to and if they are endorsing a product and putting their name to the infomercial product it must be worth buying, right? 

Some infomercial products have turned the spokesperson like Ron Popeil into a celebrity. Most people know who he is. When I hear his name "Set It and Forget It" comes to mind. Get rid of that fat from your foods and walk away while your food cooks. I have one of his rotisserie and I have to admit I love it! The food comes out real moist and tasty. Ron has come out with a whole line of helpful kitchen products. 

George Foreman also got into "Get Rid Of The Fat" products. I also have his George Forman grill which is awesome for making sandwiches, hamburgers, cooking bacon and I find it easy to clean. It seems every year he perfects his product with a new line. 

I do like infomercials and get easily drawn in. Sure some are just ridiculous gadgets that we really do not need and just end up in the back of the closet after a few uses. What about the products that you see advertised all the time and have been around for awhile? They must be living up to their ad and do what they say if some many people are still purchasing. 

Television is a very powerful way to advertise a product and have it endorse by a celebrity and the product can become an instant hit. The internet has become another tool for advertising these products. The web makes it even easier for us to purchase. If you walked into the tail end of an infomercial you can find out more about it online. Do a search for the product name and you should be able to find it on the web. You can even find sites that have short clips of the product in action. 

What will be the hot As Seen On TV Product this year????
