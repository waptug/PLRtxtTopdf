Wow! This onion dip is not your typical out of the package dip. Instead, you pretty it up with a scooped-out ball of Gouda cheese. No kidding! Because it's so beautifully self-contained, it travels well when you want to take this as an appetizer to a party. Not only that, but your friends will be bowled over by the presentation and the great flavor. There will be no leftovers!

<b>What you'll need:</b><br>
- one 10-oz ball of imported Gouda cheese<br>
- 4 Tbsp unsalted butter<br>
-1 small yellow onion (finely chopped)<br>
- 4 oz roquefort cheese (crumbled)<br>
- 4 oz sharp cheddar cheese (finely grated)<br>
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce<br>
- 3 drops of hot pepper sauce<br>
- 1 tsp whole-grain mustard<br>
- 4 Tbsp dark beer or stout

With a sharp knife, cut the top to make  a lid from the Goulda cheese ball, about 1 inch thick. Save the lid. Hollow out the cheese without cutting through the wall of the ball. The wall should be as thin as you can make it on all sides. Take the reserved Gouda cheese and grate it and set aside.

In a small skillet, heat 2 Tbsp of the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and saute until it reaches a golden brown color. This usually takes about 7 to 10 minutes. Stir often. Remove the onion from the skillet and set aside to cool.

Combine the Gouda, Roquefort, and Cheddar cheeses in a food processor, along with the remaining butter, the onions and the Worcestershire, mustard, and hot pepper sauce. Process the mixture until smooth. Scrape the sides occasionally. Pour in the beer and continue to process until smooth and creamy.

Next, fill the hollowed out Gouda ball with the mixture. You'll probably have more mixture than will fit in the ball. Place the lid on the ball of cheese and put the remaining dip into a bowl. Cover both with plastic wrap and refrigerate before serving. 

One nice aspect of making this dip is that if you make it a day ahead, it actually enhances the flavor. When you serve the dip, bring out the Gouda ball in time to reach room temperature. You can use the additional dip to refill the cheese ball. 

This recipe makes approximately 2 cups. You must refrigerate it at least 4 hours before serving.
