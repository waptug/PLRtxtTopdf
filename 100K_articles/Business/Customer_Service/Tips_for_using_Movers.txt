Getting a moving company to help you with the difficult task of moving is a great idea.  There are so many moving companies that it may seem hard to find the perfect one for you and your needs.  You should treat hiring a moving company like you would if you were hiring a doctor or having any other service done.  You have to research the people and the companies to make sure that you getting the best choice for you.

After you find the movers that are right for you and your needs, you should do a few things to ensure that you are protected and that you have an easy and safe move.  You do not want to have any problems with your move.  It should go as smooth as possible.  You should always take notes when you are talking to the movers and write down everything that they say.  They will give you a quote and a confirmation number.  It is important to get that number as well as the names of the people that you talk to at the moving company.  If there is ever a problem, you will know who to talk to in order to get it settled. 

You should always make sure that you make a necessity kit for your move.  When the movers come to take all of your belongings, you may find that it is difficult to find exactly what you are going to need for the first night in the new home.  You should make your own box of the things that you are going to need for the first night and take that package with you.  This will include your clothes, toothbrushes, and a set of sheets, blankets, and towels.  This will be a big help in the morning. 

You may also want to protect certain things before the movers get there.  This may include some of your irreplaceable keepsakes.  Although the movers are there to do all of this work for you and make your life easier, you may want to box up the things that mean the most to you and take them with you.  The movers that you hire should have insurance to cover anything that is lost or broken, however, you can not replace the memories of some things that you have so it is easier to just take care of these things yourself.  

Something that will help you and the movers is to take the pets away for the time that the movers are there and for when they take the items to the new house.  You may want to take the pet to a friend’s house or a kennel until after the move.  Things will be hectic and the last thing that you need is for your pets to get in the way of the movers from doing their job.  You want your move to be as simple and as fast as you can.  

The last thing that you should do is relaxed.  You have hired people to help you with the hard things and it is important for you to let them do their job.  You should concentrate on the other things that are involved with moving and do not worry about the movers.  They are professionals and they will take care of everything.
