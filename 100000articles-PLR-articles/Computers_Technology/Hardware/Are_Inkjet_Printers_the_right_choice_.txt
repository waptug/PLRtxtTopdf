Inkjet Printers are not only getting better but they also becoming less expensive with time. A branded inkjet cartridge can cost you $30 or more and if your printer uses a multi-color ink cartridge system ink costs could easily $1000 to replace all inkjet cartridges for your entire inkjet printer.

The growing business of inkjet printers has brought about additional benefits to them. Manufacturers have built their business around the supplies rather than the printer itself. They have made the inkjet printers an inexpensive commodity sometimes selling them at lower cost or may be even less thereby making long term profits from inkjet printers.

An Inkjet printer uses a unique printer mechanism, which provides quality printing. They transfer tiny droplets of ink directly to the page. This is the reason why you will find most photo printers are inkjets. If you want to print photos at home, photo inkjet printer would probably be a perfect choice. For instance, if you want to print few photos, few e books or print any other project work an inkjet printer would help your cause. Inkjet printers are far less expensive than laser printers.
