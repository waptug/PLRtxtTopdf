3. Choose a site, then have a browse through the deals and evaluate your options. Get an idea of the mobile phones and calling plans available within your budget.

4. Pick a deal and sign up.

Chaching!

You're done! You'll receive your mobile phone and contract in 1-3 days. Mail in your redemption forms on time, and depending on your deal, after a number of months you will get some or ALL of your line rental refunded to you. Lovely feeling, that.
