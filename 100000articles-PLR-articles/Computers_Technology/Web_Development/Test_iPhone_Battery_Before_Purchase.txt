Testing the iPhone battery is something that requires expertise that the ordinary user of iPhones may not have, which means that one is then dependent on needing to read up reviews of how well or badly does the iPhone battery work. It certainly pays to do some legwork before buying your iPhone as you do not want to end up with something that is going to fall short of your expectations and which may cause you disappointment as well. Thus, before you actually purchase your iPhone makes sure to check out the many reviews that are available regarding the working of the iPhone battery among other features.

No doubt, the specs will show a usage time that is supposed to be excellent though only actual testing will reveal the true picture about how the iPhone battery functions while talking and browsing with your iPhone. Sometimes, you may find that the life of the iPhone battery is not even close to the specifications mentioned in the manual. According to experts that have checked out the Apple iPhone battery life, they found that far from giving 5.5 hours of voice, it actually only did four hours and three minutes of voice, and just three hours and eleven minutes when browsing. This is well below the stated 5.5 hours and so you need to take that into account before considering your iPhone purchase.

A possible reason why the iPhone battery life falls far short of its listed times could be the heavy amount of power that is consumed by its giant screen though it could also be because of improper charging of the battery and also because the batteries them are faulty. In any case, it pays to find out these things well before the actual purchase.

There is no doubting the fact that iPhone testers were less than impressed with the Apple iPhone battery life, and instead of a promised eight hours of talking and six of internet use, according to tests these times were greatly exaggerated and actual battery life was no more than four to five hours, which is what you could expect from smartphones. This is a reason to be concerned because four to five hours of battery light would not serve you if you happened to be on an international journey and were in the air for ten plus hours and needed to talk to someone during the flight. It would also not be very good for watching videos that are sure to drain the iPhone battery sooner than expected.
