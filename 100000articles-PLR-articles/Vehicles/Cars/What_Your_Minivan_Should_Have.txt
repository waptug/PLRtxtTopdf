When it comes to practicality, nothing comes quite close to owning a minivan. A minivan is also known as a multi utility vehicle, or MUV, and also known as a multi purpose vehicle, or MPV. It is just like a van however, it has rear side doors and windows and its interior can actually take in around seven people or more. It also could take in various types of cargo. Thus, the very reason why when it comes to practicality, people often choose minivans. 

Aside from your minivan holding a large amount of people and cargo, a minivan should also have adjustable pedals and telescoping steering wheel. This would be a good thing for parents or drivers of minivans to be comfortable. Adjustable pedals and telescoping steering wheels are of big help to people who are not physically that long.  

A center folding storage tray always helps a lot especially to those with kids who would have to eat inside the minivan. Simply described, a center folding storage tray is actually just a tray with cup holders. They fit in between the front captain chairs. 

The automobile world calls this mirror the overhead convex mirror. However, to parents and to guardians, they call this a conversation mirror. It works as a spyglass. Parents and adults in the front could simply look in the mirror and they would be able to see what is going on at the back without having to turn their heads. This assists parents to keep the whole situation at the back in control. 

A low tire pressure warning system is another feature that your minivan should have. This gives the drive the ample amount of information regarding their wheels. Of course, it is important to have the tires inflated just right. If they are over inflated or under inflated, the chances of having a blow out or of meeting potential accident situations are increased. 

A reverse sensing system or a rearview camera would serve as your eyes. They are extremely helpful especially when backing up a driveway or a parking lot. The thing is, with a minivan, you cannot see much at the back especially if you have a group of children with you as passengers.
