Sell it yourself

If you have decided to sell your used car by yourself then the usual route is to place an ad in news paper in classified section, put for a sale, sing in the car and both. The ad should be placed and runs when it is most likely to be read by the people, mostly on weekend s when all prefer to read it. The ad should be more attractive so that one should feel that they are going to get a very good deal.

Try keeping a standard price for sale of your used car most of the times in such type of selling the buyer ask you to reduce the price and start barging on it that’s leave you wiggle room. Decide ahead how much you will reduce and then stick to your gun. 

Take some time to take a decision don’t accept the first cash just wait for few days and see you may get the better offer than the first one. 

Trade It In

Trade-ins are easier and best way to get your used car sell because the dealer handles all the paperwork and the credit can provide a down payment on a new model. However, you will probably get less for your vehicle what deal you have been made with the dealer, whether it’s a lower trade-in quote or a higher final price on the replacement car.

Until and unless you have agreed on the purchasing price for the replacement car its best not to bring up the trade-in. This will help you to keep your transaction separate so that the trade-in doesn’t go in the hands of car dealers. 

Use a Consignment Lot

For a percentage of the sale price -- which you, not they, determine -- a consignment service will display your vehicle and handle all the paperwork. Using a consignment lot lets you get a better price than a trade-in, yet allows you to avoid the hassle of selling the vehicle yourself
