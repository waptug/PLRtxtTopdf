If you haven’t heard about CRM it’s time you did. CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management software. There are many excellent software packages on the market for you to explore.

What will CRM software do for your company? CRM software is designed to assist your business in organizing all data that is related to the client. That’s right from the sales lead to the sales close and everything in between including. It will build a complete client profile and that profile is available to all staff members whether they are in marketing, sales, or accounting.

Still wondering why you should use CRM software? Here’s a scenario that your company has likely already experienced.

1. You have a potential customer that phones to ask a question about your product. Your staff answers.

2. Next day that same potential customer emails you an additional question and your staff answers that.

3. Two weeks later they email back “Yes.” Okay but two weeks have gone by and you have no idea what the “yes” pertains to.

4. The next day she emails referring to the telephone conversation of which you have no record and are unsure how to proceed.

Customer service issues can become complex quickly, especially when you multiply by the number of customers you have and the number of potential customers. Wouldn’t it be nice to have all of their information at your fingertips? That scenario described above would have bee a piece of cake if all the information relating to the conversations were recorded somewhere and your CRM software will do just that.

You’ll have both happy potential customers and existing customers because you will be able to deal with them quickly and efficiently. And isn’t that what we all want? Your staff will also be less stressed and happier because they will be dealing with happy customers. After all picture the above scenario happening hundreds of times a month or week. There’s a lot of wasted time and energy messing around with this kind of thing.

When we think hi-tech we commonly think of a system that are very un-personal, and place individuals in little compartments removing the human element. CRM is not like that – rather it helps staff remain more personable, and it keeps customers much happier because staff can instantly help them.

But there’s more to CRM software. It allows marketing departments to collect and analyze data so that they can better target their consumer. It allows technical departments to know where improvements need to be made, it allows sales departments to re-evaluate sales information to look for weaknesses and strengths, and it also allows management of all levels to evaluate staff and customer data.

Customer Relationship Management software is one of the most powerful customer service tools to become available. And serious business owners that want to get that edge and stay ahead of the competition or discovering CRM and all of its advantages.
