When was the last time you had yourself measured for the correct bra size? Do you even know your correct size? 

These questions are pertinent to you getting the right bra, as well as saving you money and undue stress. To help you avoid some common pitfalls, I have listed a few more important questions that you really need to ask yourself, before buying a bra: 

-Do your bra straps dig into your shoulders or rib cage? 
-Does your bra ride up your back? 
-Is the front of the band too tight to get a finger under? 
-Do your bra cups feel slightly empty or too full? 

If you answered yes to any of these questions, then the likelihood is that you are not wearing the right size. You should not assume that the size you were two or three years ago is the same size you are today. Your body will change, as will your bra size. If you have lost or gained weight, chances are that you will need to change your bra wardrobe. 

You Should Be Fit By A Lingerie Specialist At Least Once A Year. 

A well fitted bra is essential for both comfort and posture and is especially important during teen years. A badly fitting bra can be the reason for back problems and muscle tension, this can lead to life long problems with posture and back pain. For this reason, you should be fit by a lingerie specialist at least once a year or, preferably, after every noticeable growth or even reduction. This advice is even more important for teenagers who are just beginning to wear bras. 

Take A Quick Measurement At Home. 

You can take rough measurements at home which will give you a good idea of what your size should be. A simple way of doing this is by following these very simple steps: 

1. First stand up straight and wrap a tape measure around your ribcage, under your breasts. Pull it firm but not tight. 

2. To measure your cup size, wrap the tape around the fullest part of your bust, and again pull it firm but not too tight. 

3. To the measurement around the ribcage, add five and round it up to the next even number. This will give your band size. 

4. Now, calculate the difference between the band size and the cup measurement to get your cup size. If the amount you get when you calculate for your band size is equal to that of your cup size, after you have added five, then your cup size will be A. 

-Up to one inch difference is cup size B 
-Up to two inches is cup size C 
-Up to three inches is cup size D 
-Up to four inches is cup size DD 
-Up to five inches is cup size E 
-Up to six inches is cup size F 
-Up to eight inches is cup size G 

Although the correct size is of utmost importance, there are a few other things you should know. As you try on different types of Bras you should make sure the area in between the two cups comes into contact with your chest. Dont allow the straps to support your breasts unaided. This can become very uncomfortable after long periods, as well as the bra wearing out quickly, and pressure on the straps can lead to back problems. 

'The Perfect Bra'

Your bra should hold the whole breast in each cup with no bulging or spillage, as well as not having excess space in the front part of the cups. The bra should rest evenly against the ribcage, with sufficient room to slip two fingers in at the back. Your breasts should be supported totally, and stay in place even if the straps are slipped off the shoulders. 

Now that you know the importance of having the right size and being fitted for a bra by an expert, let?s have a look what types are available and the different uses involved.
