Will we ever see the days of cheap gas again? With everything happening in our world it is very doubtful that we will ever see the return of low fuel prices. What can we do to save on fuel and help our budgets out?

Here are some basic tips to improve gas mileage or save fuel in general. Some of these are obvious, but you may not have thought of some of the items on this list:

•Carpool
•Buy a more fuel efficient car or hybrid
•Plan trips depending on the errands you need to run and develop a route
•Consider buying a motorcycle
•Ride a bike or walk to the local store
•Make sure maintenance on your car is up to date
•Keep tires inflated at proper levels
•Use fuel saving products on your car
•Limit air conditioner use in the summer as it reduces MPG efficiency

The main idea here is to think of every little thing you can do to save on gas prices, and combine the ideas together. Collectively, you can possibly save hundreds or thousands of dollars a year of you develop a plan and stick to it.

The other plan of action, and this is a long term one, is to lessen your dependence on gas and fuel overall.

This may not be practical for some people but for spouses or co-workers that live and work in similar locations it is ideal.
