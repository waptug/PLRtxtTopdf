Technology is advancing at such a rapid pace that most of us cannot keep up with it. Broadband internet has made it easier, and quicker, to go online. What does this mean for avid music fans? They can listen to music without interruptions that are common with a dial-up connection, and also stream videos without worrying about breaking images.

Having just released his latest album in December 2005 entitled Tha Carter II to much critical acclaim, and selling over 238,000 copies it's first week, Lil Wayne has seen an even further increase in his popularity. His mp3's are in huge demand and can be found on virtually every mp3 site. Lil Wayne Mp3's can be downloaded (for free in some cases) and instantly transferred to an mp3 player such as an iPod.
