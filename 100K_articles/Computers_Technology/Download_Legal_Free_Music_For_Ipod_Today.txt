Should you wish to avail yourself of some download music for your Ipod, I would definitely recommend the legal free music. Very large numbers of people own an Ipod, and there are many of these people who try to find the music they want on disreputable P2P sites, where many of them have found their computers infected with viruses. I’ve told people time and again about the free legal music download sites but they aren't listening. Will you?

The benefits of free legal music downloads-1
One of the most important benefits of these legal download sites for your Ipod is that you are not breaking the law. The Government or law enforcement officers will not come chasing after you, and record labels will not be seeking to take legal action. To me that is a massive point in their favour.

You have a lot to choose from. If you want to download free legal music for Ipod, it is often possible to find all that you are looking for on one site. You can find all of the songs you want, all on one site with easy access. This is totally different from the usual experience of people with the illegal P2P sites. You can have a very annoying time searching through  descriptions etc hoping that someone will have uploaded the song you want. If it isn't there, the frustration gets even worse. You have a lot less chance of this happening with the legal sites, as a few of them have over 90 million files. That’s a lot of music!

They are faster. Most of the reputable free sites will have you pay a joining fee at the outset. This one off charge goes toward their upkeep costs for servers and customer service staff etc. One great benefit of this is that the download speeds are way in advance of what you would get with a P2P site. When you become accustomed to fast download speeds, you will wonder whether the slow download speeds on the illegal sites are even tolerable.

It is much safer. Unlike the P2P sites, you don't live with the constant fear of your computer being destroyed by viruses, or infected with spyware. The legal sites are professional businesses, and the downloads from these sites will be safe, and they will be exactly what they were supposed to be.

Downloading legal free music for Ipod is without doubt the best course to follow. I’m very glad to have my memberships, and I can’t begin to calculate how much I have saved in comparison with Itunes by having access to the legal free sites.
