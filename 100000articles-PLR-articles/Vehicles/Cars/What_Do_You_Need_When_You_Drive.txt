If you think that driving is as simple as breathing could be, think again. Driving takes much more than the knowledge to drive and much more than the attitude towards driving. Driving actually means more on preparation and being ready and prepared in case there are some untoward incidents happening on the road. 

Of course, being prepared is something that would give you a level ahead from someone who does not even have anything useful in handy.

Bringing your cellular phone with you is one of the most useful things you can have during emergencies. You can dial 911 if there is an accident. You can also call for assistance if you are not that knowledgeable on car breakdowns. The only problem that you may encounter, though, would be if you get stuck in an area where there is no cellular phone coverage. 

Having a flashlight in your vehicle is good. In fact, it could not be only used during stormy or dark nights but you can also use it to check for your car’s parts underneath. However, bringing a flashlight also has its responsibilities. Make sure that you have good batteries inside. You may need it for an emergency however what you did not know was that your batteries are already dead. 

An owner’s manual is a good thing to have around your car. It provides you the right amount of information regarding how your car works and assists you in knowing why your car may be acting up. Aside from this, your accident and insurance information would also be of great help if there are accidents on the road. 

Other important things that you may want to stock up inside your car include a tire pressure gauge, a toolkit (which could include a screwdriver and a wrench), tire sealant, flares, a warning triangle, a jack, a tire iron, extra oil, extra coolant, and jumper cables.
