Commercial stools take a beating, especially in busy bars and pubs. Most patrons don't think about how they treat the seats, so over time you can count on lots of abuse. You'll want bar stools that can handle it. Look for hard metals or thickly varnished woods, as well as seats that are easily and inexpensively repaired when they inevitably get worn down or tear open.

You'll want your establishment to be visually attractive, of course. It's easy to overlook the importance of procuring bar stools that complement the rest of the décor, especially the tables or bar counters they'll be used with. Neutral colours are a good idea. Avoid stools that use colours that are too bold and eye-catching, unless this is the theme you are planning to pull off.

Keep in mind that your business is likely to undergo décor changes from time to time. Unless you don't mind investing in new bar stools each time there's a change, try to find a set that is versatile enough to change with the interior design scheme. It may be hard to anticipate each change, but if you choose stools with neutral colours in traditional designs, your chances are good of being able to keep them for years to come.
