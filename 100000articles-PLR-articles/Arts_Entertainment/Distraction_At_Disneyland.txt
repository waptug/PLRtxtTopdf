There is always something to see or do at Disneyland, but Disneyland adds to this with nightly amusement while the summit time, and weekend entertainment during the off time. There is also special entertainment during particular occasions, such as the Fourth of July and Christmas. 

Fantasmic is held doubled each night-time during the pinnacle season, and on weekends during the off season. The exhibit takes place on Tom Sawyer's Island, and features many characters, music, and fireworks. For the best room possible, purchase tickets for Fantasmic in advance, but note that free seating is also convenient, and is included in your Disneyland woodland entry cost. 

The Parade of Dreams features great colorful floats accompanied by many Characters. This parade takes place doubled each day. During the parade, the entire parade will stop three times to do a choreographed show, and most of the Disney Characters are portrayed in the Parade of Dreams. 

In the Fantasyland Theater, you can see a tuneful of Snow White. This show is held several times all through the day. This show should not be missed especially if you love Snow White. Since the show is held several times each day, reservations are not necessary.

These are just a few of the shows that are available at Disneyland. Again, entertainment is an continuous object at the park, with each day bringing something new. One thing that you can indubitably count on, of line, is the fireworks! The fireworks show is held late each night-time once the park closes for the day. 

Even if you can't stay for the fireworks, you can probably see them out of your hotel window! Try to get a view of the Fireworks from in front of Sleeping Beauty's Castle for the greatest effect. The fireworks on the Fourth of July are out of this world.

To find out if there are any special shows or events during the time that you will be at Disneyland, visit the website, call the park, or ask your travelling agent to find this information out for you. You may also want to inquire about special events during definite months, so that you can method your stay at Disneyland for those days. 

Most entertainment is provided free of charge, and is portion of your admission cost. However, special seating, or priority seating usually requires a fee, as well as a reservation. Some events require an admission price that is part from your park admission. Again, check the website, call the park, or consult on events and fees with your travel agent when planning your Disneyland vacation.
