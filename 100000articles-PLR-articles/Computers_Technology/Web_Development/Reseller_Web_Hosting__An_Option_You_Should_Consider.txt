Most people surf the internet and look at all of the web sites available and never think about how they are built, or how they are able to run.  However, to a programmer, these things are very important.  A programmer will look at the different tools available to design and create the web sites and also look at some of the things that customers need for their web sites.    

The biggest problem customers often face is the lack of web space available for  customers to post their web sites once they were created.  It is very hard to find inexpensive, reliable web space on the internet these days.  There is often inexpensive hosting , but it is not reliable. Or perhaps you can find reliable hosting, but it is expensive. 

Reseller web hosting options intrigued me very much, because the amount of web space that was available was tremendous.  Also many of these companies offered many different tools to help setup your new site, or to manage and setup a reseller web hosting business of your own.  Some of these options supply a dashboard and management console so that you can setup and manage new web sites that you host on your reseller web hosting site.  

Many of these sites also offer the ability to create unlimited domains and sub-domains for your customers, so they can create any web site they need.  Many of these companies also offer a control panel for your customers so that they can manage their web site and get vitals statistics which will help them make decisions about what improvements they need to do to make their web site better.  Many people believe that the money in the web development market is in creating websites, but that may not be entirely true. The money may actually be in hosting the websites.
