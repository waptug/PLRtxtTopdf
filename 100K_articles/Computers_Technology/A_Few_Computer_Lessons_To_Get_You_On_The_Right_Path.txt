If you don’t know how to use a computer at all, it’s a good idea to get a computer lesson and get started. Even just having a basic working knowledge of how to use a computer and how to use the internet will drastically increase the amount of things you can do and open a lot of doors that would otherwise be shut for you.

Indeed, if you are still working or looking for employment (i.e.; not yet retired) knowing how to use a computer will allow you to do a world of different jobs you never would have been able to before.

You are extremely limited in the kind of work you can do without any knowledge of computers, so it is well worth whatever the fees are for a computer lesson or two.

Of course, if you are reading this you probably already have at least a basic knowledge of computers because you are online right now. Even if you already know the basic skills to use the internet and some simple programs like word processors or spread sheet programs, an additional computer lesson or two can still be very valuable.

Most programs have loads of features above and beyond the more obvious ones. Word for Windows and Excel, for example, may seem pretty self-explanatory initially, but with a couple of computer lesson you can do things you never would have even dreamed before with even such standard programs.

Even operating systems, like Windows XP or the Mac OS series have loads of features and nuances that a few computer lessons can expose for you.

I took some night school classes held at a local high school on the beast of a program that is Adobe Photoshop a while back, and the computer lessons were invaluable to me. I have just begun to crack the surface of that particular program and yet I can do things with photos I never would have imagined before.

Live classes are probably the most effective way to get a computer lesson, but another thing I recommend is buying computer courses in the form of interactive CD-ROMs or DVDs to be played on your computer.

These can be done at your own convenience, in the comfort of your home, and are generally less expensive. One I recommend is ‘Video Professor’. His commercials are kind of annoying, but they are very affordable computer lessons and cover the basics for most programs you’d ever use.
