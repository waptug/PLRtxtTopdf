Weight Training

If you are trying to lose weight, but have hit a plateau, you may want to add weight training to your daily workout. Weight training is different for men and women, and you may find many women are reluctant to try it. No matter who you are, weight training can be beneficial, even if you don’t think you need to lose weight. This is a great way to build muscle, and help tone up areas of your body that you thought were destined to remain wobbly and wiggly. It doesn’t have to be very hard, and you don’t have to buy expensive equipment to do it.

When you think of weight training, you probably think of huge men lifting heavy weights over their heads while huffing and puffing. Though weight training can help a man get this large, women do not have to worry about this. A woman’s body is different from the male body, and she is far less likely to see anything from weight training but a smoother and smaller frame. Women simply do not bulk up like men, and even those who are trying to do this have a hard time.

You can join a gym for weight training, and use the help of a personal trainer to help you learn how to breath and lift correctly. When you join a gym, you have many different types of machines from which to choose, and you can choose the one you like the best. Some are for the entire body and others are meant to target certain muscle groups. If you don’t know what you are doing, don’t be afraid to ask for help. You want to get a good workout and you want to make sure you aren’t causing injury by using improper form.

Women can go about weight training the same way, but they can also easily do it at home. Simple weights that weigh one, two, or even five pounds may be all they need. You can walk with the weights in your hand to enhance your workout, or you can use them in your home to do sets of repetitions. You can find DVDs that will help you understand how to do this, and what you will get out of it once you begin. You can also by ankle weights for home weight training as well.

If you want the benefit of the gym for weight training, but you don’t want to have to go there every time you work out, you can buy a weight bench or machine for your own home. Make sure you do your research first, and buy something that you will enjoy using. If you get bored quickly, or find the workout to be difficult, you are more likely to quite before you see any real results.
