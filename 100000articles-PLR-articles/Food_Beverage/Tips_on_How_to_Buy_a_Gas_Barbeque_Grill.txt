We found some excellent advice on buying a gas bbq grill from one grill vendor. 

Your first consideration that you should think about is knowing how many you'll be cooking for. While bigger can be better, you also have to consider cost, the amount of fuel you'll need to have on hand, and the space you have to hold and house your gas bbq grill. 

Another aspect is knowing how proficient you are in keeping that grill in top notch condition and how much time you want to spend on this. While it's great to have the best and most feature-prevalent grill, the fancier it is the more parts to service, clean and break. 
Paying a little bit more for a quality barbecue may be a sound decision if being built to last several years is an important consideration as you think about which one to choose. 

Make sure that the gas bbq grill you buy has devices for flame taming that cover the entire burner on your gas grill.  This is important because grease is the most damaging ingredient for your grill. You also want the flame tamer to be directly over the gas grill's burner. 

The final thing to think about is determining which brand is for you, especially if you are going to buy something simple with hopes of adding on accessories. Some gas grill brands have few accessories, some have many. Some top brands to consider are Weber, Brinkman, and Coleman.
