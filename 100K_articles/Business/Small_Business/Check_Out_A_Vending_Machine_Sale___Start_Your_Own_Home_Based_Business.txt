With a vending machine sale, you have the opportunity to have a business where you do not have to worry about credit card fraud, bounced checks or credit. The vending machine business is a cashless industry in that you do not have to even deal with the customers. You get permission from business owners to place your machines in their location and purchase the products from distributors of bulk vending products. Since you buy in bulk, you will only need to make purchases occasionally. The more bulk products you buy, the more money you can save. 

Even with a vending machine sale, you should not expect to become rich over night. Like any other business, the vending machine business requires work. If you start small and learn the ropes, you can easily develop this home based business into your main source of income.
