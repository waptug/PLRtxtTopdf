Since the basic purpose of wearing Bras is to provide your breasts with the support they need, you'll have to be very clear about the type of bra that'll suit you best. 

One simple rule here is that the larger your breasts are, the more important the type of bra you wear. 

Large breasted women can almost never go without a bra, since it can lead to back, shoulder and neck pains but can also be extremely uncomfortable. 
Can't Find A Bra That's Not Underwired? Don't Be Surprised! 

Now if you're like most women, you'll like bras that are not only good looking but also provide your breasts with that strong support that prevents pain, sagging and fatigue. Furthermore, large breasted women need strong, firm bras that make them feel comfortable. 

Underwired bras provide exactly that. They have wires that are placed in a semi-circular shape right below the cups. This results in providing that extra lift and support that a lot of women require. 

It is precisely for these reasons that these bras have grown rapidly to become one of the most popular types. So much so that these days, you?ll have a real hard time finding a bra that does not have an wire in it. 

Though it is true that they provide your breasts with more lift, some women do find them quite uncomfortable and prefer Wireless bras instead. This is truly a very personal choice. Some women swear by them while others stick to wireless. 

The only way to find out which of these two types works for you is to try them out. Choose whichever ones makes you feel more comfortable and provides you with a snug fit. 

For Nursing Mothers... A word of advice. You should not sleep wearing an underwire bra. Nursing mothers should also be careful when wearing them. Make sure that the wire in the bra is not putting undue pressure on your breasts. This could lead to the milk ducts getting blocked, resulting is mastitis. 

Like I mentioned previously, you'll know the type that suits you best until you try one on. Keep trying them on and you'll finally be able to stick with a model that'll suit you for an entire lifetime.
