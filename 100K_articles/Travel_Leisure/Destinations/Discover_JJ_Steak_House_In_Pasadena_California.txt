This place is not in a ritzy glitzy building, is not in Beverly Hills, Manhattan or on the Loop, does not have a fancy entrance with expensive cars parked in front and you can walk or drive past it every day without knowing it is there. What it does have is great food served well in a romantic setting. If you appreciate fine quiet elegant dining with excellent fare served properly at very reasonable prices, you will love JJ Steak House. By the way, it is JJ Steak House not JJs Steak House.
