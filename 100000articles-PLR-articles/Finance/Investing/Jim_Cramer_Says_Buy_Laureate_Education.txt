Article Body:
Doktor Cramer opened his “Mad Money” television show on CNBC last Friday with a very positive review of Laureate Education Inc, LAUR; NYSE. Cramer reminded us that this company was previously known as Sylvan Learning Centers. The company has changed its name and its corporate direction. It’s focused south strategically but not “going south” technically.

While offering diplomas to anyone with the necessary financing was initially a good business in the USA, students have displayed a litigious tendency to seek compensation if they fail to land the type of jobs they feel they prepared for. But in the overseas markets where LAUR is now focused, students are putting down their cash and taking their chances that diplomas will allow them to participate in the growing Latin American economies.

Cramer pointed out that Morgan Stanley research recently put out a buy recommendation on the shares of Laureate Education 
because of their sizeable presence in Chile, Mexico and Brazil. The company recently bought the fifth largest private school in Sao Paulo, Brazil and is moving into parts of Europe that offer good growth opportunities, like Crete. 

LAUR shares closed Friday at $53.25, up 81 cents or 1.5 % on the day.
