If you've been searching for the perfect Christmas gift for someone on your holiday shopping list, gift baskets can be both fun to give and to receive. As the holiday season nears, consider making a Christmas gift basket to stand out from all the other gifts under the tree. This is fun to put together and even more fun to give. With just a bit of thought and planning, the gift basket idea will be accepted by others thinking "I wish I would have thought of that!"

After giving out Christmas gift baskets for a couple of years, you may find that you have started a new trend among your family and friends. The next Christmas might be filled with all kinds of Christmas gift baskets. This is a great idea because when someone puts together a gift basket, they add a personal touch to it by taking generic gifts and showing that some thought and effort went into it.

When you think about it, Christmas isn’t about toys or clothes or pretty shiny diamonds, is it? Okay, everything but the shiny diamonds. Christmas is, however, a special day that brings family and friends together. Christmas has for sometime now been about materialism and not religious activities, lending to over spending during the Christmas holiday. Giving a gift basket is a subtle little way of saying how much you care for others while sticking within your budget.

Things to Avoid

When deciding to put together a Christmas gift basket for your family or friends, don’t give items of a religious nature unless you are certain of the beliefs of those who will be receiving the Christmas gift basket. Giving something that you consider appropriate might offend someone else and it could even stop a relationship cold, possibly forever.

Also, if you're strongly considering a Christmas gift basket, think about the amount of money that you want to spend. You can easily go overboard when you put in five things in a basket and add the cost of packaging and bows. Add the price of each item including tax and the basket itself. When deciding what to put in a basket, only add personal items if its for family or close friends.

Remember, giving a gift basket isn’t calculus. Just take a little time to think about the gift and keep the price in check while at the same time personalizing it for the person it is intended for. A Christmas gift basket is a wonderful way for you to say Merry Christmas to others while adding a personal touch. Why not start early this year and have fun making baskets this Christmas?
