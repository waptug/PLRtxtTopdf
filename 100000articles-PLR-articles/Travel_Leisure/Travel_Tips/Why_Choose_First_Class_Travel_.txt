Today, when airlines offer more economy seating and more cut-rate fares, some customers and industry watchers predict the end of first class travel. 
After all, many of the most luxurious methods of travel in the past - including the once-famous MGM jet and the Concorde - are no longer offering service. It's too early to mourn the end of first class travel, though. At a time when it seems that low-cost air travel and trips are de rigeur, some companies are working harder than ever to provide high-quality first class travel experiences. Many more business, executive, and even pleasure-seeking travelers are choosing to travel first class.
 
There are many reasons why customers choose first class travel arrangements. Many note that the exceptional service and small extras - such as blankets and better food - ensure a pleasant trip experience. On a longer trip, these small extras allow passengers to arrive in good spirits and in a relaxed mood, ready to begin their day's business or their vacation without undue hassle or fatigue. 
 
Many business passengers find that first class travel arrangements help them make the most of their trips and help to project a professional image. For many passengers traveling for pleasure, first class travel is a pleasant luxury that adds to the quality of a trip.
 
If you have always avoided first class travel because of the cost, it is time to look at your high-end travel options again. Airlines, boats, and trains are all offering better-class travel experiences at almost all price levels. There are upgraded travel packages that offer some of the perks of first class travel at a fraction of the price, for example. Look around and talk to your travel agent - you might be surprised at how much sense first class travel arrangements make.
