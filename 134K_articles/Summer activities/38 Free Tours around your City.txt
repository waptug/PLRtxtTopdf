Free Tours around your City

Tours of local attractions take place on a regular basis but you can organize your own 
tour with just your kids or with a few other families in your neighborhood.  You may be 
surprised by what companies and organizations will provide free tours of their facilities.

The fire hall is always intriguing to young children.  If you call your local fire hall and 
speak with the fire chief he will be happy to arrange a time for you to stop in with your 
children.  They will show the kids around, let them see inside the fire engine and if there 
is time the children can see a fireman in all of his gear.  Not only is this fun, it is a safety 
precaution for kids.  Chances are they will be less scared of a firefighter in his full 
uniform with a mask if he or she sees one before an emergency.  You will have to be 
prepared for the tour to be cut short if an emergency is called in.

Your local postal outlet may provide small tours too at no charge.  Call ahead and ask to 
speak with a manager and ask if you can stop by and show the children what happens to 
the mail after it is dropped in the mailbox.  The volume of mail that the post office 
handles and the machines that are used to sort letters are sure to fascinate the kids.

The grocery store or supermarket will conduct tours for young children.  The manager of 
each department (deli, bakery, produce) will let the children know what they do to 
provide fresh food to the customers.  Each department plays a very different role in the 
store and this can be an educational trip for everyone.  Most times the children get to 
leave with a cookie or other goodie from the bakery department.
