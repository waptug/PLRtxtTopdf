Sennheiser Headphones are one of the most amazing pieces of technology to give you great sound, and make a great present to give to yourself or anyone you love. They outdo many other brands that are out right now, and can be bought at great prices as well.

This particular brand works hard to please customers, and has done so with their fantastic line of headphones that work great for almost any use. They are user friendly, stylish, and the list just goes on and on.

#1 Block Out Background Noise

Have you ever been listening to your favorite song and then a bus goes by or someone is talking loud next to you and you miss that "had to hear it" part of the song or whatever? Well that won't happen with this headphone brand. The closed ear cups keep outside noise outside, making it much easier and more enjoyable to listen to music almost anywhere.

#2 Great design

Unlike most other headphone companies on the market, these ones are simple yet stylish. They have only a few buttons that cover the necessities, yet look great enough to take with you anywhere when on the go. They are full-sized yet lightweight and easy to take with you, making them the ultimate package when looking for the perfect headphone brand to stick with for life.

#3 Comfortable

Wrapped in comfortable padding and fabric, the Sennheiser headphones are a must have. They won't get uncomfortable after wearing them for a few songs, especially since they cradle your ears to provide the ultimate listening experience. Their lightweight design makes it seem like they aren't even there, so you can listen during many of your normal day-to-day activities.

#4 Very User Friendly

Even though the advancement of technology over the past few years have been absolutely amazing, it is sometimes nice to be able to easily use a product to its full extent. That is possible when you purchase this brand of headphone, since there are no crazy buttons or menus to fidget around with. Everything you need, such as volume, power, and tuning dial, are all included, making it possible to listen to music without having to spend hours reading an owner's manual. They can be used right out of the packaging, and are great for anyone who is technology-illiterate.

#5 Durability

You will never have to worry about them dropping or accidentally breaking, since the strong design makes them durable and ready to take on the world. They are great for taking on the go because they can be thrown into a purse or bag with no problem, or you can even throw them around your neck for a short outing. Don't worry about your children with this particular brand, because the padded headband is strong yet lightweight at the same time. They are a great investment that can be passed on to future generations, as long as they are taken care of and not abused.

#6 Ambient Sound Capability

You will never have to worry about not being able to hear your friends talking or your cell phone ringing, since tiny microphones are used to pick up and transmit ambient sound to the user. The tiny microphones can distinguish close important sounds such as a conversation from background sounds, making it possible to have an amazing listening experience. The important noise is heard and the annoying stuff gets left behind.

#7 Price

These cans may be more expensive than some of the brands that can be purchased at local superstores or drug marts, but they are well worth the price. They outdo all other brands within the same price range, and perform much better than any other company can claim. They range from about $100 to $500 depending on the model, and can be used for years and years to come.

They are currently the most comfortable, stylish, durable, and user friendly phones on the market right now, and have features that no other company can offer. The Sennheiser headphones have an amazing price that can be afforded by many, but leave people feeling like they are living the luxurious life.
