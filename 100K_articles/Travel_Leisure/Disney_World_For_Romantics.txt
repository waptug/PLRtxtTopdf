** Rent a surrey in the evening At Disney's boardwalk and enjoy the ambiance

** Take a horseback ride on one of the beautiful trails at Fort Wilderness. Led tours last 45 minutes through the sublime pine scented woods. Perfect for nature lovers. The more energetic might like to cycle along the trails. Bike rental is available from the Fort Wilderness Bike Shack 

** Stroll round the world showcase at EPCOT after the illuminations. You have time to walk right round the world at a slow pace before the park closes for the day

** Snuggle close together on the Tower of Terror at night. The views across the park are awesome.

** Ride the transit authority monorail at Magic Kingdom after dark - magical!

** Take a walk anywhere in Disney World after dark but a particularly nice walk is from the Polynesian Resort to the Grand Floridian.

** Share an ice cream sundae at Ghiardelli's Ice Cream Soda Fountain at downtown Disney. Choose one of the yummy sundaes with two spoons and watch the world go by as you enjoy your treat. 

No Romantic vacation would be complete without a candle lit dinner or two . Here are our suggestions.

The California Grill on top of Disney's Contemporary Resort has the most fantastic panoramic views of the magic Kingdom. Time your meal to coincide with the fireworks. The restaurant lights are dimmed and the music is piped in. But it's not just the sights that make this restaurant special - the food is to die for. Forget anything you might have read about Disney World food being substandard. Loads of locals eat at the Californian and you can't get a better recommendation than that.

Victoria & Albert's at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa.

This is the only restaurant in Disney World with a dress code so it's the perfect excuse to get your glad rags on. This elegant and intimate restaurant is the prefect place for a table for two. It's expensive but the service is impeccable and the food is award winning.
For all Walt Disney World dining information, call 407/WDW-DINE (939-3463

I hope these ideas encourage you to enjoy some grown up time at Disney World - it's not just for kids!
