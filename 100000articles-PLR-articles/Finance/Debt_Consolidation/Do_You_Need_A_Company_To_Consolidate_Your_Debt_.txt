Once you’ve made the decision to take action to reduce your personal debt, the next step is a solid debt reduction plan. For some, that plan rests upon using the services of a debt consolidation company. But, do you need a company to consolidate? An important question, one that deserves real consideration.

What Does A Debt Consolidation Company Do?

In general terms, a debt consolidation company negotiates with your creditors to reduce interest rates and to create an extended payment schedule. Then, they help you to devise a financial plan that will that will help you to meet the negotiated terms, making one payment that the consolidation company disperses to the creditors. A debt consolidation company makes their money from the fees that you and other clients pay, and in some cases they also receive a percentage from the creditors as well.

Making The Decision

If the services you are seeking from a debt consolidation company do not include a loan with which to pay creditors immediately and then repay to the lender in a monthly payment, then in many cases you can do much of what a debt consolidation company can legitimately do for yourself.

For example, you can call your creditor yourself and negotiate a reduction of interest rates and work out a manageable repayment plan. Indeed, as the national credit debt burden grows, many creditors are pleased to work with people interested in resolving their debts. You can make a budget plan for yourself, which should focus on paying the highest interest debts first, as well as on trying to save even just a little bit to help you maintain payments if something unforeseen happens.

There are times, however, when the services of a debt consolidation company may be the most efficient route towards becoming debt free. If, for example, you are unable to successfully negotiate with your creditors, due to failure to meet terms on previous agreements or some other circumstance, it may help to have professional assistance. If your debt history is complex, it may be worth the fees to let the credit consolidation company do what they do best, while you focus your energies on earning the money you need to meet your repayment schedule and other financial obligations.

If you do choose to work with a debt consolidation company, be sure to select carefully. Do in-depth research and comparison on the companies you are considering, which will help you to avoid predatory companies and find the best solution for your financial situation. Never sign anything without being absolutely sure you understand all fees, rates and terms involved.

Making the decision to work towards being free of debt is an important step towards improving your life in general. More important is devising a solid plan to achieve your goals. Part of that plan is deciding whether or not you need a company to consolidate debt. There are advantages to using a debt consolidation company, as well as to doing it on your own. A thorough assessment of your financial condition and your own abilities will help you to make the best decision.
