For so many contestants it is a very upsetting time after the show ends.  Many contestants start to believe that they are going to fall into complete oblivion, but at the same time there are a large number of contestants who have failed who are able to go onto create a truly wonderful career.  In order to actually discover who has been successful following American Idol it is extremely important that you take some time to really look over all of the contestants and see who has been successful following the show, and who has not.

The majority of the contestants who make it into the top few places of the show tend to be offered some sort of recording contract.  It is important to realize that not all contestants who are offered a contract are actually successful though.  Simply being offered a contract is not a guarantee of success, and this is where many people tend to slip.  The idea seems to be that once a recording contract is offered, the hard work ends.  In fact, this is the moment when it just gets started.  For the majority of musicians it is critical to understand that not only is the contestant up against the other recent American Idol contestants, they are also then up against the seasoned professionals who make their living using their vocal talents.

The true test for the contestants is when they are up against all of the other professionals in the music industry and determine exactly how they are going to ensure that they stay relevant.  What most American Idol contestants do not realize is that hard work and dedication is simply not enough.  It is very important to create music that people actually want to hear.  It is also important to actually make music that you are interested in though, this means it is very important to balance these creative desires.

There are several failed American Idols who have done very well for themselves following the show.  The first that tends to come to mind is Chris Daughtry, this is the biggest success simply because of the fact that he went on with his band to create major success.  Additional huge successes come from people such as Jennifer Hudson who has gone on to a career in film, while picking up an Academy Award for her performance in Dreamgirls.

Trying to predict the success of an American Idol contestant is never easy, however taking the time to actually connect with the audience is a key ingredient of success.  At the same time, though it is absolutely critical to take some time and really start looking at all of the musical inspirations that each musician has.  If you are looking to create a true connection with your audience, it is very important to tune into the whims and desires of the crowd.  For many this is extremely hard to do, and for others it is even more difficult to do.

As you watch each season of American Idol, you have no doubt seen several different artists that you are interested in watching create a special career.  Working on a separate CD is not something that all contestants are suitable for.  However, it is possible for many of the contestants to create a truly unique album if they are given the opportunity.  The important consideration is the fact that most people simply do not have the time, or the resources that would allow them to actually create a spectacular album.

Pulling for the contestant that you are interested in is very important, because as everyone knows it is critical to ensure that your favorite contestant receives the recording contract.  Typically speaking, it is known that those contestants who are extremely popular are much more likely to actually receive a contract over those contestants that are just merely tolerated by the viewers.  It is extremely important to ensure that your favorite contestant goes as far as you would like, which means showing your full support.  While most people are fully aware that it is difficult to obtain a recording contract having huge amounts of support is always a great assistance for the contestant that you have chosen.
