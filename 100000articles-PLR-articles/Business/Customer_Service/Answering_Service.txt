Summary:
Just about everyone these days has some sort of answering service, whether automated, like an answering machine, or live.  When you call someone without a service, often it can get very annoying.  This is especially true when it comes to businesses.  However, customers do not usually want to call a business and get just an answering machine or voicemail.  They want to speak to another individual that can help them with their problems or answer their questions.  This makes it necessary for a business to have some form of answering service.  Whether customers are calling in with orders or just calling in with questions, a business must have the proper tools in order to be prepared for the task – and that requires a well-qualified answering service.
