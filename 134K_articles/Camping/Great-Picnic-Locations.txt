Are you interested in having a picnic adventure?  If you are, you are definitely not alone.  In the United States and all around the world for that matter, a large number of individuals, families, and couples love hosting or attending picnics.  One of the many reasons for that is because picnics don’t just involve eating, they also involve socializing with friends or family, as well as playing outdoor games and sports.

If you are in interesting in hosting a picnic, you may be wondering what your options are, in terms of location.  If you are, you will want to continue reading on. Below, a few of the many places that are great for picnics are outlined below.  

Perhaps, the best place for a picnic is at a park. When it comes to parks, you will find that you have a number of different options.  No matter where you live, you should have access to a number of nearby parks, parks that many include public parks, campground parks, or state parks.  Most parks have areas that are ideal for picnics. These areas often include shade from trees, picnic tables, and nearby fun activities, like a pool or body of water for swimming or fishing.

Speaking of a body of water, you may also want to think about having your next picnic, should you choose to have one, near a body of water, such as a lake. As previously stated, it is possible to find public parks that are located near lakes; however, you may also be able to find public land that is ideal for picnicking. These areas may not necessarily have playgrounds for children or public restrooms, but they may provide you with a little bit seclusion, as well as an absolutely beautiful view.

Speaking of seclusion, if you are looking to have your picnic double as a romantic date, you may be looking for privacy.  One of the many ways that you can find privacy is in a wooded area.  This is best if you are already visiting a state park, public park, or campground park.  You can also use wooden areas around your home, namely ones that you may be familiar with.  As nice as having a picnic on a blanket in the forest may sound, it is important that you use your best judgment when taking this approach.

As great as it is to go camping in a beautiful location, a secluded location, or one that gives you access to a number of other fun outdoor activities, like swimming or boating, you may be looking to stay at little bit closer to home.  If that is the case, you can have your picnic right in your own backyard!  This is ideal if you are looking to have a picnic with your family, namely small children. Doing a few “practice,” picnics at home may help to prepare your young children for the real thing later on.

Although not as glamorous as the above mentioned picnic locations, you can also have a picnic right inside your home. This is best if you had a small picnic planned, but the weather took a turn for the worse and you are unable to have your outdoor picnic.  Laying a blanket down in a family room may provide you with enough space to have the picnic of your dreams, just indoors. This is particularly ideal if your picnic was intended to be a romantic date for you and your partner.

The above mentioned locations are just a few of the many places that you may be able to hold a picnic. When deciding where you would like your next picnic to occur, it is important that you place a focus on the size of your picnic, like how many people you plan on inviting. Doing so will enable you to choose a location that will allow you and all of your guests to have a great time.
