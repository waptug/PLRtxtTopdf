}Assessing ATV Trailer Quality\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 If you have
 or are planning to buy an ATV, chances are that you will need an ATV trailer as
 well. An ATV trailer allows ATV owners to transport their ATV safely and much more
 easily than trying to use the bed of a truck. ATV trailers come in a variety of
 sizes depending on your needs. You can find trailers designed to haul from one 
to six ATV\u8217\'92s at a time. While other flat bed trailers can be used to transport
 ATV\u8217\'92s, a trailer designed for the task is the safest option.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 An ATV trailer
 is made up of a deck that the ATV\u8217\'92s are loaded on to and a ramp that folds
 up during transport and serves as a safety device for holding the ATV in place. 
Single ATV trailers usually come in two sizes, 5\u8217\'92 x 8\u8217\'92 and 5\u8217
\'92 x 10\u8217\'92. The size of your ATV will determine the best size for your 
ATV trailer. If you have two or more ATV\u8217\'92s, you can find trailers that 
measure 5\u8217\'92 x 13 or 5\u8217\'92 x 14\u8217\'92 that will fit the job. If
 you need to haul more that two ATV\u8217\'92s, you can have ATV trailers custom
 made to your specifications.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 The trailer
 you choose should be sturdy and strong enough to hold the number of ATVs you intend
 to haul. Trying to fit more ATV\u8217\'92s on a trailer that was not designed for
 it can cause extreme stress on the trailer and the added weight can cause it to
 break. Most ATV trailers have a tongue mounting system and you should make sure
 it is sturdy and will not bend, crack, or twist during transport. The main support
 beams on the trailer also need to be strong as this is where the axels attach. 
The weight of the trailer\u8217\'92s load is transferred to these beams during transport
 and if they are not high quality, they can bend or break. The trailers cross members
 should also be strong because if they twist or warp it will cause the corners to
 flex and will crack the trailers welds.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 The safest
 system in an ATV trailer is the tilt clamp system. They are also easy to use and
 more stable. The tilt clamp system is also faster to attach than a traditional 
hitch system. The tilt clamp system pulls the trailer and tongue together with a
 T-bolt that also reduces vibration. No matter what attachment system your ATV trailer
 uses, make sure it is properly connected and secure. You do not want bumps and 
vibrations during transport to cause your trailer to become unhitched.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 ATV\u8217
\'92s can be very useful or a fun hobby. Make sure your transport method is the 
proper one for ATV\u8217\'92s and that you use the proper precautions. Always secure
 your ATV on the trailer and make sure the ramp is secured in the upright position
 so that it does not fall during transport. An unsecured ATV on the back of a trailer
 can be extremely dangerous. Only use a high quality trailer to ensure that it will
 not warp or break and it will last you many years.\par}
