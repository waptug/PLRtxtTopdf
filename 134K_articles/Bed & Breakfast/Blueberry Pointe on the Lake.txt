Blueberry Pointe on the Lake

Chepachet, Rhode Island is a beautiful place.  Blueberry Pointe on the Lake fits in well with the beauty. Every Blueberry Pointe on the Lake room features the tranquility and splendor of lakefront backdrop, a private bath, ultra-plush mattress, designer linens and towels, and a famed gourmet breakfast. They furthermore include complimentary wine, hot tub use, a private beach, and kayaks, canoe, and paddle boat. 

Birds flourish on Sand Dam Reservoir in the summer. The protection of the lake becomes a meeting place for mallards and geese.  The kingfisher dives into the lake, beak first, and captures fish.  Nesting herons squawk and flap up into the wind after victorious frog feasts.
	
Blueberry Pointe land is bordered by Nature Conservancy land which links acres of woodlands to neighboring ponds, wetlands, and forests all the way to the Connecticut border. The staff has maps, field guides and binoculars to borrow, and they offer a reservation service for local activities and restaurants. 

The Sunrise Suite is a bright accommodation with a separate private bath, tub and dual showerheads.  The bedroom and sitting area has a queen size bed strewn with plush pillows.  A TV with DVD and a stereo system are included for your enjoyment. One special amenity in the Sunrise Suite is this antique cast iron faux fireplace on a tiled hearth surrounded by a custom built mahogany mantel. 

The spacious Moonlight Suite is located on the second floor of the main house and comprises the master bedroom, a private bath, and a sitting area/library. The Master Suite is lit by a wall of windows capped by a large half-round.  The view to the grounds and the lake beyond is inviting yet promotes privacy.

These are just two of the rooms available at the Blueberry Pointe.  There is a room to suit nearly every preference.
