\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Air ambulance
 transportation is not a common service that everyone uses on a daily basis.  This
 type of flight is not one that you can click on a travel website and get the cheapest
 fare available from city to city, or is it?  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 In non-emergency
 situations, patients and their family have time to prepare for special circumstances
 that may arise during medical treatment.  If travel by air is necessary, but standard
 commercial flights are not available due to specific medical restrictions, the 
patient may require the specialized care from an air ambulance service.  Customers
 can\u8217\'92t logon to well-known travel sites for price quotes and information
, but options are available.  By contacting air ambulance service companies, you
 will be able to quickly receive a price quote.  Some air ambulance services will
 require potential clients to contact them by phone while others respond to email
 inquiries.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Many company
 websites for reputable air ambulance service will have a link to get an immediate
 quote.  This option is great for families who want to privately compare prices 
and learn about each organization before bothering the air ambulance service with
 the details.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 One of the
 best ways to get accurate quotes for air ambulance transport is by letting the 
companies fight for your business.  Certain websites will allow customers to input
 the pertinent travel and medical information and let the companies send in their
 prices.  From the comfort of your home, you can peruse the information at your 
leisure.  Based on the price quotes from the air ambulance transport companies, 
you can then do a little more research on the organization to find the one that 
is right for you.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 When comparing
 price quotes from air ambulance transportation service companies, make certain 
that you are comparing apples to apples and not apples to oranges.  Find out what
 is included in each price quote.  Does the air ambulance fee cover any and all 
ground transportation to and from the aircraft?  Are family members permitted to
 fly in the air ambulance with the patient?  If so, is this fee part of the price
 quote?  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Another important
 factor to consider during this process is the type of medical care the patient 
will receive during the flight.  Learn what type of staff will be on board the aircraft
.  Are there additional fees for specialized services such as a respiratory therapist
 or NICU team?  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Before settling
 on a specific company, find out what type of aircraft will be used.  For trips 
over 500 miles, a jet is recommended for patient comfort and speed.  Air ambulance
 companies will vary their price quote based on the type of aircraft, so this is
 a major factor when considering cost.  \par}
