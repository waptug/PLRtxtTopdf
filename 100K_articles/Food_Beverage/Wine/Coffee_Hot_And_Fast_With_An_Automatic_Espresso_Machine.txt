For the passionate coffee lover – those who love their coffee pure and rich and strong - not much rivals the automatic espresso machine in terms of convenience. Whether you visit your local coffee shop where the air comes alive with the hiss and heat of steam or you invest in an at-home automatic espresso machine where you’re free to tinker with the perfect coffee recipe, the results are the same – the perfect cup of coffee and a very, very happy coffee lover.

The automatic espresso machine comes in two varieties; semi automatic and full automatic. Using a semi automatic espresso machine requires partial participation on the part of the user. Whoever is operating the machine must start it at which point the automatic espresso machine takes over. When the brewing process is complete, the user then shuts down the machine. The full automatic espresso machine does not require any operator participation. This is usually a larger and pricier automatic espresso machine due to its heightened complexity; but it brews completely on its own coordinating a system of water, grinders, and extractors. 

Deciding which automatic espresso machine would best suit your needs depends on its intended use. For commercial use, a full automatic espresso machine makes more sense; there’s more space for a larger machine and the demand for multiple cups of espresso would make the need for heavy operator participation inefficient.

For at home use, a semi automatic espresso machine would be sufficient for private brewing. Its smaller size takes space issues into consideration and it is normally less pricey than its larger counterpart.

To find the model that works best for you, start your research on the Internet. You will be able to access thousands of consumer report records that will tell you which of the machines you are interested are performing the best.

Whether it’s in the local coffee shop – or in your home - an automatic espresso machine can readily brew the highest quality cup of coffee available.
