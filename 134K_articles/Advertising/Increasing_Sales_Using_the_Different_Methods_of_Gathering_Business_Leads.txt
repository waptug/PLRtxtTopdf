Article Body:
Business leads are one of the most important parts of a marketing plan. It allows companies and individuals to find investors, donors, response buyers and even a new business to expand company production. However, looking for business leads is not as easy as it may seem because you have to go through thousands of consumers and contacts before you can find the right leads. 

Fortunately, there are different methods of gathering business leads today. Such methods include:

1) Collecting Telemarketing Lists - One way of gathering consumer leads and business leads is through telemarketing lists. These lists contain demographic-specific telephone numbers of consumers and businessmen who are interested in buying your product and services or doing business with you. 

2) Creating E-mail Lists - Through the Internet, you can easily promote your products and services as well as contact investors directly on their personal e-mails. However, simply collecting random e-mails is not effective in increasing sales. Instead, gathering e-mail lists of your target consumer leads or business leads should be your goal. This way, you can reduce the need to sort those who are truly interested with those who don't care about your business.

3) Conducting Surveys - Surveys are great marketing tools. This enables you to know what your target audience needs and wants. As such, you achieve feasible business leads that will surely sell, instead of leaving your products to chance. This way, not only can you create sellable products that your consumers will buy, you also build solid email lists of your "preferred" clients.

4) Gathering Targeted Contact Information - If you want reliable business leads and consumer leads, you should also gather contact information from new homeowners, new movers and new business. Thus, you can keep track of your customer base and investors even if they changed residence or company addresses.

Improving sales is doable if you only know where to start. Looking for business leads by conducting surveys, creating email lists, collecting telemarketing lists and gathering targeted contact information are four effective ways to gather contact information of consumers and businesses, even of new homeowners and new business. If you know that your sales are dropping, switch to another marketing plan that includes these methods of building business leads and you would be shocked how your sales dramatically increased.
