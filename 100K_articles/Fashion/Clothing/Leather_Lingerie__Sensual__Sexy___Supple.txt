Have you ever worn leather?  Ever felt it touch your skin?  Smelled it while your eyes were closed?  Leather is a unique material unlike any other you will find.  It’s unique characteristics make it different than wearing anything else.

Lingerie is very popular to say the least.  Leather lingerie, while not nearly as popular as many other common types of lingerie, is certainly quite special.  Although the comfort ability of lingerie has improved immensely over time, still nothing can compare to the feel and touch of leather lingerie.

Leather doesn’t itch or scratch you as you put it on.  Leather is initially cool to the touch and then it warms up with you as it becomes one with your body.  All leather has its own aroma that is unmistakable.  

From gloves to chaps and pants to boots leather has been used throughout history to protect the fragile skin of human beings.  But wearing leather in an intimate way does something quite different than any thing else.  It seems to bring out certain primal feelings that are buried deep in your subconscious mind.

Maybe it is something being drawn out of the human psyche from thousands of years of evolution when the first cave men and women would wear leather to cover their naked bodies.

Although the use of leather is wide and varied, leather for lingerie is a great way to change how you view yourself and how others view you.  When your partner catches the first glimpse of you in a snug fitting supple leather outfit, it will bring out the primal feelings of one thousand years.  You might just be surprised at the passionate moments that will overcome you both as your instincts take over.
