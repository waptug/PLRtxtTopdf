If your need is to repair, design or to manufacture electronic equipment, then the oscilloscope is a necessary piece of equipment. For those that do not know what it is, it is a device or a scope that creates a visible two dimensional graph of one or more electrical potential differences. In short terms, these measurements allow engineers to effectively measure and then manage electrical output. Consider the oscilloscope to be a camera that doesn’t take photos but captures signal images that can then be looked at and interpreted.

There are several things to consider when it comes to the purchase of an oscilloscope though. For many individuals, these products will indefinitely alter their ability to perform accurately so it is important that the proper, most accurate devices be used to do so. So, when it comes to oscilloscopes, you’ll want to consider the following elements:

• Bandwidth
• Rise Time
• Sample rate
• Waveform Capture Rate
• Record Length
• Vertical Sensitivity
• Sweep Speed
• Gain Accuracy
• Triggering Capabilities
• Effective Bits
• Horizontal Accuracy
• Resolution
• Frequency Response

The comparison of these elements in the oscilloscope will mean several things. First, the more advanced the technology, the more accurate, easy to use and the more reliable the device will be. These features each have various abilities and they each can make a significant difference in the quality of information that is provided. Yet, we do have to consider that the oscilloscope has several very high tech features which can make it expensive. Lesser expensive options are available in the oscilloscope but the proper balance of features and price will undoubtedly deliver the best possible product for you.

There are also many information portals now devoted to the subject and we recommend reading about it at one of these. Try googling for “oscilloscope” and you will be surprised by the abundance of information on the subject. Alternatively you may try looking on Yahoo, MSN or even a decent directory site, all are good sources of this information.
