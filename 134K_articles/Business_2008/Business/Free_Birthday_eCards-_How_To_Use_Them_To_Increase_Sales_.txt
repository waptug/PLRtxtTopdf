Birthday ecards create a difference in your relationship with the buyer. Normally your buyer would like to think of you as a professional and not as a friend. You do not figure amongst the list of their friends at all. Your objective is to get your name included in that list so that you can have long-term relationship and keep getting repeat orders.
