Summary:
If you had a super power it would be easy to rob a bank to get rich quick but if you decided to do it by cheating in a casino what powers would you want. Here is a list of some of the more popular super powers and what games they would be best to help you win tons of cash in a casino.


Keywords:
X Ray Vision:
The ability to see thru other objects would be a great help in casino games such as poker, blackjack, and baccarat. You would be able to know what every other player had in their hands and what the next cards to be dealt were. So you could know when you should fold and when you should raise the bet in poker. You would know when to bet on the house and when to bet on the player in baccarat and when to hit when playing Blackjack. This ability would not really help much for roulette or craps.


Invisibility:
This super power may be good as a teenager to sneak into the locker room of the opposite sex, but it definitely is not the best for gambling in a casino unless you are working with a partner. With a partner you could find out what the other players have in their hands for poker, and in Roulette the invisible one could stop the ball on a certain number or could move your bets to the winning number as soon as the ball stops on its own.


Rubber Dude:
The power to stretch and bend could be really cool and it can be helpful in a casino, but you have to be careful. If you are going to move your bet on after the dice has been rolled in craps you have to be careful there are 4 people that work at a craps table watching you, but it can be done.


The Thing:
The things super power was that he was made of stone and had almost unlimited strength. This would be good if he wanted to become a professional wrestler or an UFC fighter. He would be undefeatable. How to you punch something made of stone. What submission hold works on rocks, but how strong you are is no advantage to cheating in a casino.


Manipulate Fire:
This would not be a good power for casino gambling. There is lots of wood in a casino and a small fire could quickly become a big hotel fire trapping and killing thousands. 



Speaking to Animals:
This would be really cool if you were trapped in the woods or if you fell off a boat or from an airplane, but unless you are playing poker and there is an aquarium or some caged animal behind the other players I really do not see the advantage.


Kinesis:
If I could pick any power at all I would want to be able to move small and large objects with my mind. This would allow me to cheat at craps and roulette by manipulating the outcome of the game without anyone seeing. 


Telepathy:
This super power would fall right under X Ray Vision because you would know what everyone had in their hands, but you could never know what was the next card in the shoe like you would if you could see thru things. So this would be helpful but not the best one to have.


Super Hearing:
The only way I can think of to make money with super hearing in a casino would be blackmail. I am sure people talk about things they should not discuss in public in a casino thinking they are safe with all the noise of the casino.


The Flash:
If had the ability to move faster then the eye could see, you could have a big advantage in a casino. You could change your bets or change the cards in your hand without anyone being able to see you


Mind Control:
This would be one of the best of them all even better then X Ray Vision. It would not matter what you had in your hand you could make everyone think you won. This is the only super power that would work in an online casino, and that is assuming that you can control the minds of people who may be across the world.


If you should ever gain a super power you should know nothing says you have to use it for good.
