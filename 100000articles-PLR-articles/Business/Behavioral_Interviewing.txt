Have you ever wondered, while interviewing a candidate, how will you suspend your own personal biases during the interview?  Well, if you have, you might want to read on and learn how to do just that.

Behavioral interviewing is a relatively new mode of job interviewing.  Employers such as AT&T and Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting) have been using behavioral interviewing for 15 years, and because increasing numbers of employers are using behavior-based methods to screen job candidates, understanding how to excel in this interview environment is becoming a crucial job-hunting skill.  

What is Behavior Based Interviewing?  Behavior-based interviewing focuses on your past experiences, behaviors, attitudes, personal skills and capacities that are job-related.  It is based on the belief that past behavior and performance predicts future behavior and performance.  You may use work experience, outsides activities, hobbies, volunteer work, school projects, family life as examples of your past behavior.  However we suggest to focus on job related performance as much as possible.

How Can I Prepare for A Behavioral Interview?

• Be familiar with the type of positions for which you’re applying.  
• Reflect on your own background.  What skills do you have that relate to the job you are applying for?
• Think of examples from your past experience where you demonstrated those skills.  How can you give an example about your use of particular skills or knowledge?  
• Be prepared to provide examples of when results didn’t turn out as you planned.  What did you do then? In hindsight, what would you do differently?
• Identify two or three of your strengths and determine how you will convey these assets during the interview.
• Once you land your desired position, keep a personal achievement diary to help document demonstrated performance.

How Do I Prepare For a Behavioral Interview If I Am The Interviewer or Company Hiring?

• If the job could talk; what would it say?  About:
- The behaviors of the person who will always be able to deliver superior performance?
- The attitudes of the people doing the job?
- The attributes or soft skills needed for superior performance?

• Job Benchmarking with a system such as Trimetrix, reveals why, how and what an individual can contribute to a job.  

• It identifies a complete hierarchy of competencies or personal skills.  It allows you to clarify any position issues.  It prioritizes and validates the competencies required.

• This can be done for any:
- Leadership/Management Exempt position
- Professional Exempt position
- Hourly non-exempt position

• Anytime you need an unbiased opinion about whether someone is right or wrong for the job, the computer will analyze the input of up to ten respondents to identify the importance of the 23 soft skills competencies.

• Where can you do this…through the Internet!  Have up to ten respondents identify the importance of the 23 soft skills competencies and then see how your candidate matches up.
