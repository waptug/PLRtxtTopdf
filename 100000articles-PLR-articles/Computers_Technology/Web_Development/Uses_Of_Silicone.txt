Cements of part of silicone are of everyday usage to seal gaps, joints and cracks in the buildings. Silicones are abundantly available for this purpose, in the professional, as well as the categories with the detail. Treatment of part of silicones by absorbing the humidity of the atmosphere, which helps in the professional installation. To make a very soft silicone joint, independently to mask the edges with the band, if practical, the professional matting tools often wet the spoons out of wooden and the tools out of wooden matched and hand-wrought, that they soak in water with the diluted dishsoap. Silicone will not stick to the wet and soapy wood, which makes this ideal to create a perfectly soft surface. - it-yourselfers typically use a finger humidified to trace the pearls ordered in the silicone stopping-up. The similar methods function for the urethan stopping-up, which silicones completely strongly compete with.

White silicones frequently slightly turn the yellow with time. The force and the reliability of the silicone rubber are largely recognized in the construction trade. The factories of body of motor vehicle and the stores of painting must avoid the presence of all silicones, because only one council of its presence in any form can cause serious failures in paintings of the motor vehicles. Suppliers and the contractors with such factories are often requested to check in the writing which they will introduce no silicone into the factory. In the piping and the fields of the motor vehicles, the silicone grease is often employed like lubricant. Wire of the motor vehicles of spark plug are often insulated by multiple layers from silicone. Such a construction prevents the spark from jumping to an adjacent wire, causing a failure. It to the minimum reduces also the IFR, which can interfere a commercial computer of engine. In piping, grease is typically applied to the rings in the taps and of the valves. In the field of the motor vehicles, the silicone grease is typically employed as lubricating for components of brake since it is stable at high temperatures, is not water-soluble, and is less remote than other lubricants to clog brake linings.

Cooking applications

Silicone is also soaked in the parchment paper and employed like material with not-stick for applications such as the treatment to the furnace and cooking to the vapor. Silicone also does the lubricate-resistant paper heat and it. This makes it possible paper to stripe sheets and the act of biscuit like replacement to lubricate, dispatching of this fact the series production of the goods cooked with the furnace. It is also used generally in the pocket making cook, where ingredients are sealed in a made parchment paper container and allowed to cook with the vapor. The silicone rubber is also employed to make the ustensils (in particular spatulas) and the bakeware.

Electronic components

Of the electronic components are sometimes protected from the environmental influence by locking up them out of silicone. This increases stability against the shock, the radiation, the vibration and particularly the electric insulation. Silicones are selected above the polyurethane or the epoxy encapsulation when a great choice of operating temperature is required (- 150 to 600 F). Silicones also have the advantage of little rise exothermic in heat during the treatment, low toxicity, the good electric properties and the great purity. Consequently it is employed when longevity and the high output are required components under hard conditions, as in space (satellite technology). Silicones, however to be relatively expensive and can be attacked by solvents. (See the resin frame for the way whose silicones can be distributed in the production of chart). [to publish] the menstrual cups a menstrual cup is a type of the cup or barrier carried inside the vagina during the menstruation to gather the menstrual fluid. Menstrual cups are often made of silicone for its longevity and reutilisability.
