To understand the importance of a registry cleaner, let us understand how Windows work. Windows has a database that is used to store system information, which is necessary to configure the operating system for the different users that will log on and use the system. It also stores all the information that is needed to configure the hardware and the various programs or applications that will run along with the operating system be it windows 98, XP or any other version of Windows. This information is constantly referenced during the operation of the computer. This is the central registry system of the PC. Every time we use the PC the registry constantly grows and gets rearranged. This constant change and growth eventually slows the system down to a crawl. Here is when the Window registry cleaner steps in to do a thorough job of ridding the system of all the redundant data stored therein.

In the earlier days, windows used to store these configuration data in the INI files. The system had to be configured manually every time some new software was installed.
