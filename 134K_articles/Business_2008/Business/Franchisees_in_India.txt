Franchised operations in India are increasing by the day. Being geographically vast and culturally diverse, India offers the most favorable franchising environment. While companies benefit by having many profit making outlets in different parts of the country, franchisees in India benefit by being able to generate good returns with little investment and risk involved. Entrepreneurs are making the most of India’s franchising market and growing economy by becoming successful franchisees. Indian franchisees can now choose from a plethora of international as well as domestic franchising companies. There are numerous attractive franchising options available in various sectors. 

Ever since the franchising boom in the nineties, there have been many success stories. Franchisees in India helped many businesses grow and establish, while also gaining immensely from their business ventures. Examples of international franchises that have been successful in India include food and beverages giants such as Subway, Mc Donald’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken among others. Indian companies that have benefited from franchising include names such as Barista, MRF, NIIT and Apollo hospitals among others. It’s not just the bigger companies; smaller international and domestic companies also look for franchisees in India. The capital required for such ventures would be smaller when compared to highly reputed companies. The downside however, is that the risks are more, since you cannot ride on the popularity wave generated by the reputed companies.   

Depending on your choice of business, you can either work from home or from an outside location. The initial capital you may require to start a franchising venture will depend on the type of business and the franchisor’s requirements. Most home-based franchise options are suited for work-at-home women. Cosmetics, healthcare products, services, home business household products and e-commerce ventures, make for convenient yet rewarding franchising options. Franchisors provide training and support and your business can gain from the image and professionalism of the franchising company.

Franchising allows entrepreneurs to have their own business, without many of the risks associated with a start-up business. Franchising also offers you great income and a flexible work style. But, as a potential franchise purchaser, you need to carefully consider the finances and risks associated, prior to starting your business.
