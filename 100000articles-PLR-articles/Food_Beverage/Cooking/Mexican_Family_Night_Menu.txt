Black Bean Corn Salsa Recipe
--------------------------------------

Salsa does just not have to be served with the traditional tortilla chips anymore. This black bean corn salsa is a great addition to any meal, or dish. Best of all, it is a fat free and low calorie accompaniment.

Happy Cooking!

* 1 can black beans - drained and washed
* 1 can corn - drained
* 1/2 cup diced red onion
* 1/4 cup diced jalapenos
* 1/2 cup chopped cilantro
* 1/4 cup fresh lime juice
* 2 large tomatoes - diced
* 2 cloves garlic - chopped
* salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Wash all your veggies, drain all your canned goods, and cut as described. Combine all into a plastic or glass container.

Chill in the refrigerator at least 8 hours, or overnight, before serving.

Tip From Chef Bek:
Do not use a metal container to store the salsa. The acids in the lime juice and tomatoes will have a reaction with the metal.

Serving Suggestions:
* Serve with warm tortilla chips.
* Serve as a sauce for fresh fish.
* Wrap in a warm tortilla with chicken, sliced avocado, and lettuce.
* Place inside a breakfast omelet.
* Add to a bed of mixed greens with some crushed tortilla chips.
