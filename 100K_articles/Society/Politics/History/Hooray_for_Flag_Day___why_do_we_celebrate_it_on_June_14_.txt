What do the colors of red, white and blue stand for on the American Flag?

Today the flag consists of thirteen horizontal stripes, seven red alternating with 6 white. The stripes represent the original 13 colonies, the stars represent the 50 states of the Union. The colors of the flag are meaningful as well: Red stands for Hardiness and Valor, White stands for Purity and Innocence and Blue stands for Vigilance, Perseverance and Justice.
