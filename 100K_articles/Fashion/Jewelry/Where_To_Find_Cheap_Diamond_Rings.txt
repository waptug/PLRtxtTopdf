The Beatles once sang that “money can’t buy me love”. And while the boys may have been right in that regard, the almighty dollar can certainly buy most anything else. Diamond rings are just one of the many luxuries that can be afforded by people with money to burn, and many times these rings can cost thousands of dollars. But what if you are just a hard working average Joe who would like to show his sweetheart that she is appreciated? Not all of us have swelling bank accounts, but thankfully there are places out there where you can buy wonderful cheap diamond rings. And when we say cheap we’re referring to price alone, as these rings are just as beautiful as their higher priced counterparts. In this article, we’ll show you where to find cheap diamond rings that look anything but.

The first place to find cheap diamond rings is at your local mall. The jewelry stores inside most malls are able to offer diamond rings at a discount for a couple of different reasons. First, these chain stores are always able to stay in profit because they experience heavier traffic than a stand alone store. In addition, they have stores all across the country, as opposed to Mom & Pop jewelry stores that are in one city or state. The diamond rings at these stores look almost identical to the more expensive rings. Only a gemologist would truly be able to tell them apart.

Another great place to find cheap diamond rings is at huge retail stores such as Wal-Mart or J.C. Penney’s. These stores have a wide selection of cheap diamond rings at amazing prices. Now, keep in mind that many of these rings will be much smaller than a more expensive ring, but the diamond quality is very similar. You should definitely have some luck in these types of stores.

If you still haven’t found the right cheap diamond ring, why not try a pawn shop? Many times pawn shops will have amazing diamond rings that they are more than willing to sell for a reduced cost. A lot of these rings look great, and the only reason they ended up available was because a person no longer wanted it. In instances like this, their loss can definitely be your gain.

One last suggestion on where to find cheap diamond rings is through the internet. The internet has many great web sites that sell diamond rings at an amazing discount. As long as you use common sense (make sure the business is reputable, has an appraisal service, etc.), you may be able to find a great ring through these online merchants. In addition, auction sites such as ebay regularly offer cheap diamond rings that can be had for virtually nothing. Get in the habit of checking out these sites to see if anything catches your eye.

As you can see, there are plenty of places where you can find cheap diamond rings. Now that you have a few ideas, why not get out there and try to find the woman in your life a little something special? After all, you know she deserves it.
