<a href="http://iphone-forum.blogspot.com">Apple iPhone</a> is not just a phone - it is a phone, music player, video player, internet device, and camera all in one. Like its Apple iPod Nano and iPod video cousins, the <a href="http://iphone-forum.blogspot.com">Apple iPhone</a> is slim and sleek at just 11.6mm thick, 2.4-inches wide, and 4.5-inches tall.

Steve Jobs has such confidence in the new <a href="http://iphone-forum.blogspot.com">Apple iPhone</a> that he has said he wants to sell over 10 million of them by 2008. I think he's setting his sights a little low, and project that <a href="http://iphone-forum.blogspot.com">Apple</a> will sell over 10 million iPhones in less than 6 months. With the following that Apple has, and the fact that this device has been rumored about and anticipated for almost four years now, it shouldn't be too far out of the realm of possiblity.

<a href="http://iphone-forum.blogspot.com">Apple iPhone</a> is a widescreen iPod that features touch screen controls that allow you to enjoy all your content, including audiobooks, music, TV shows, and movies. It features an amazing 3.5-inch widescreen display, and allows you to sync content from your iTunes library on your PC or Mac, making that content also accessible with just the touch of a finger.

<a href="http://iphone-forum.blogspot.com">Apple iPhone</a> users will be able to scroll through songs, artists, albums, and playlists with just a flick of a finger. One cool new feature of this function is the display of album artwork - you can now use Cover Flow to browse your music library by album artwork for the first time on an iPod.

The <a href="http://iphone-forum.blogspot.com">Apple iPhone</a> incorporates an accelerometer, which detects when a user switches from holding the phone in landscape to portrait mode, and automatically updates the image on screen to fit the mode. The sensors also detect when you put the <a href="http://iphone-forum.blogspot.com">Apple iPhone</a> near your phone, and automatically shuts off the display screen until you move it away to save on battery power. An ambient light sensor automatically adjusts the screen's brightness to the appropriate level for the current ambient light, which enhances user experience and also saves on battery power.

Accessories

As of now, <a href="http://iphone-forum.blogspot.com">Apple</a> has announced a Bluetooth headset that will work with the <a href="http://iphone-forum.blogspot.com">Apple iPhone</a>, as well as new headphones that incorporate a small white box in the middle of the cord. This box has a built-in microphone and a switch to answer and hang up phone calls.

The phone is expected to come out in June 2007 in USA, Europe in the fourth QTR and Asia in 2008 and it will be available exclusively on Cingular for $499 on a two-year contract for the 4GB version and $599 for the 8GB version.
