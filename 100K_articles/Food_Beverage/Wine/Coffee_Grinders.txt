All coffee drinkers have their own opinions on what's involved in brewing the perfect pot. For many, it's a combination of cold, clean water, and freshly ground coffee beans. Coffee grinders are the perfect kitchen accessories for these caffeine connoisseurs.

Coffee grinders work so well because they unleash the bean oils and create a delicious aroma before you even brew a pot. It's like opening a fresh can of ground coffee each and every morning.

Of course, there's more to cooking up a great cup of joe besides simply grinding the beans. There are different techniques for storing the coffee, measuring the grounds. The type of coffee maker and water you use can also mean the difference between so-so and simply delicious.

Coffee gurus recommend adding two heaping tablespoons of whole beans to the grinder for every six ounces of water you plan to use. If using a drip coffee maker, you should measure the water before starting the brewing process.

To get the strongest, richest flavour, freshly ground beans work best in press pots or those with permanent filters such as gold cones. Truly fussy coffee drinkers do not use paper filters, as they can create an aftertaste and absorb the special aromatic oils from the coffee beans that are essential for creating superb taste. If you must use paper filters, try rinsing them with hot water beforehand to wash away the aftertaste.

Knowing how long to let your coffee brew is another important factor. Freshly ground coffee is very delicate, and if left in contact with the water for too long, it can become overly bitter. On the other hand, if the grounds don't spend enough time with the water, the coffee may lack the full and robust flavour you're hoping for.

After brewing the perfect pot, don't leave it sitting on a burner or hotplate for too long. After twenty minutes the coffee will "burn", take on a terribly bitter taste, and take a real toll on your stomach.

Coffee grinders make it easy to start every day with a brilliant brew.
