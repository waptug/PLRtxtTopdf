Lunch Time

	Back to school means back to school lunch as well.  What are your kids going to eat?  It’s the school lunch vs. home lunch debate.  Here are the some things to consider when decided which option you would like. 
	School lunch is easier for the hectic mom or dad, or anyone who doesn’t have the time in the morning to pack a lunch.  School lunches usually have two choices each day so that your kids can pick what they would prefer.  They are well-balanced and include juice and milk.  Typically, the lunch ladies make sure that each kid gets the main food item.  This means your child won’t fill up on cookies for the day.  Some schools monitor what the kids eat as well.  You can check with your school to see what the rules are.  School lunches can be more expensive than bringing something from home, but the time saved in the morning can be worth it.
	Packing a lunch allows you to have more control over what your kids eat.  You can pack the foods you know they like.  You can still send money to buy milk or juice, or provide the drinks as well.  You know that your children will be getting the nutrition that they need for the day.
	A third alternative would be to buy school lunch for your kids but pack a lunch on the days that your kids don’t want to eat school lunch.  It makes home lunch a fun alternative and it gives them a choice when they don’t like what the school lunch is that day.
	Whatever you decide will be a good decision.  There is no right or wrong on this choice, it’s just a matter of personal preference.
