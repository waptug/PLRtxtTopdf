Article Body:
A home based business offers you the opportunity to work at home while earning profits on a full-time or part-time basis. You can often set your own schedule and create a comfortable office setting that enables you to do your daily home business tasks. What you may not realize is there are more ways than one to start your own home business. With an Internet home business, you can enhance your profits with affiliate programs by adding these to your already successful website or by promoting them solely as your business.

Affiliate programs are opportunities in which you send customers to another company and receive commissions when those customers make a purchase or sign up for a service. As an affiliate, you will be promoting someone else's products and business while you enjoy a percentage of the profits. There are advantages and disadvantages of affiliate programs, but once you understand how they work, you can easily start a home based business by promoting the skills and products of others.

Benefits of Affiliate Programs for Home Business

With affiliate programs, you're able to have a completely online home based business. By this we mean you can work entirely from home online without visiting customers or businesses in person. You don't have to network around the neighborhood with friends and family members. You can do all your promotions online from home, and with many programs, you'll never have to come in direct contact with customers. Affiliate programs offer a legitimate home based business opportunity without the high startup costs of a regular business. You don't have to stock inventory, accept credit card payments, or ship any products.

Disadvantages of an Affiliate Program

The main disadvantage of an affiliate program is a lower conversion ratio. It's commonly known that you must promote the right product to the right audience to make a sell in any business. But with affiliate programs, this is still true plus you must promote to even more people. The conversion ratio for purchases is often lower with affiliate programs than if you were to sell your own product directly. Therefore, you must promote diligently and be sure to do plenty of research to find the appropriate products with good conversion ratios.

Another disadvantage is you're at the mercy of each affiliate company. If they go out of business, so do you! It's a good idea to sign up with several reputable, established companies so you won't have to worry so much about this.

Recurring Income

An affiliate program can be more beneficial if it offers ways to make residual income. There are some affiliate programs that offer services with recurring payments from customers, such as hosting services, marketing services, and so forth. These will often pay you every time the customer makes a payment so you can earn again and again just from one customer. Other services might offer you commissions on every future purchase made by one customer. Both of these setups are often more profitable than one-time sales unless you can find a one-time program that pays really well for that one payment.

Add Affiliate Income to Your Current Home Based Business

Another home business idea is to add related affiliate programs to your current home business. You might sell your own product, but want to add other products or services without adding to your labor. Affiliate programs can enhance your income without adding more work or products. You can add affiliate links to your current website and receive commissions every time someone makes an affiliate purchase.

You might ask, "What's the best home based business with affiliates?" This is a difficult question because everyone is different. You have to consider what you enjoy doing and the types of products or services that interest you. Find something you love doing so you won't burn out after a year or so. Discover home business opportunities that pay well AND give you a sense of fulfillment every day.

With an Internet home business and affiliate programs, you'll soon enjoy profits never before imagined while doing the work you love from home!
