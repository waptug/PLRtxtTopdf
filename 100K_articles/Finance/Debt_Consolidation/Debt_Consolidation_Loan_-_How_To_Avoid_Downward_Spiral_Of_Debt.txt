Debt consolidation is an answer to many of your debt problems. It can help you consolidate multiple debt payments into one single payment, avoid filing for bankruptcy and simply help you get out of debt fast. It can help you consolidate many bills into one single monthly bill. This will give you some respite and help you get in control of your finances.

If you are burdened with debt and you are paying out too much for your credit card or personal loans, why not replace all of them with a consolidated loan.

To take control of your finances, do a realistic assessment of your income and expenses. First list your income from all your sources. Then list all your fixed expenses each month like home loan, auto loan, insurance. Next list the expenses that vary each month like clothing and entertainment. Your public library or your local book store will give you books on budgeting and creating plans for saving money. If you are not able to save money and find yourself in a downward spiral of never ending debt, you may need a debt consolidation loan.

Debt consolidation loans are offered by credit counselling agencies who have debt consolidators working in your favour. A good debt consolidator will work with you in creating a debt management plan and call up your creditors and discuss your situation with them as well as reduce your interest. A debt counsellor will also help you get a debt consolidation loan against the security of your home. This loan can be used to pay off your balances on your credit cards, store cards as well as personal loans. The interest on your debt consolidation loans is much lower than your other loans so this is a win-win situation.

While seeking a debt consolidation agency, make sure you are seeking a non profit organization which is really interested in helping you.
