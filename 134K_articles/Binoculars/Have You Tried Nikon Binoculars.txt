You can buy accessories for them:  cleaning kits, tripod adapters, tripods, field harnesses and polarizing filters, eye cups, and pillar stands.  They are user-friendly for eyeglass wearers.

One area of use that is seldom touched on regarding binoculars is that of education.  These handy products can help a parent put his or her children in touch with nature.  The children can learn about binoculars themselves and their many uses.  They can learn about what they see when they use them and the difference in the view, different professions that use binoculars, the companies that make them and how widespread they are, and the market in which they are sold.  They could, in turn, go on to teach their friends the benefits of binoculars and the world beyond their normal everyday eyesight!  Teach your child about math and the economy and products by comparing the binoculars on the market.  Teach them how people will see the benefits in different ways, how one thing will bother one person that will not bother another.

Nikon will even help you learn how to properly adjust and focus binoculars to get the most out of their product!  It offers an outstanding web site which includes the wonderful detailed pictures to teach all the fine points about binoculars.  They also offer sight-seeing binoculars for tourism purposes.  The Nikon Company proves their intelligence with this website, which helps to reinforce their reliability in the market.  There is even a USA website for their products.  

With sports being such a popular way to use binoculars, you are sure to find a Nikon pair that suits your preferences.  Anyone who has been to a big game and gotten seats that are far away knows how hard viewing can be without assistance.  No one wants to pay big money for their tickets, fuel to get there, food and drink during the game, and hassle with the crowd just to miss the best parts of the game because they can't see what's happening.  Nikon will help make your trip and your efforts to what could very well be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, worthwhile.
