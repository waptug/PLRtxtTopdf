What is SQL Web Hosting

Before understanding the concept of SQL web hosting, it’s necessary to have a basic grasp on what SQL is, and also how web hosting works.
 
* SQL is the acronym for Structured Query Language, which is a computer language that is used to manipulate data in a database. SQL works with many different database systems, such as Access, Oracle and MS SQL. SQL is widely used due to it’s simplicity and applicability to diverse database functions, many of which make up global business systems and commercial computer software.

* Web Hosting is a service provided by a company that leases server space to companies or individuals that have web pages they want to display on the internet. Web hosts provide the necessary bandwidth and technology to allow internet users to access these web pages. While anyone can create a web page, special servers dedicated to internet connectivity and hosting are required to make the web page active.

Therefore, SQL web hosting is a service that allows SQL databases (http://www.sql-programming.com/) to be hosted on the internet. SQL web hosting can be used to store database information on the web, allow offsite personal to access database management tools and provide detailed information to customers or clients. Typical applications that use SQL databases are ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and CRM (Customer Relationship Management) programs.

What are the Benefits of SQL Web Hosting

There are several advantages to investing in an SQL web hosting service rather than relying on a standard web host. If you require a web based database, you will quickly come to appreciate these benefits:

* Increased RAM and Bandwidth – Typically, database applications take up a lot of memory and server space. SQL web hosting services provide additional room for your database to evolve and grow over time.

* SQL Administration Services – Because SQL web hosting services are dedicated to database hosting, they generally have the ability to offer advanced administration services to keep your database running smoothly and at optimum performance.

* Technical Assistance and SQL Design – If you’re new to SQL, many SQL web hosting services provide technical assistance and design packages for an additional cost when you purchase web hosting.

Things to Look for in a Quality SQL Web Hosting Service

Once you’ve decided to go with an SQL web host, you’ll need to select a service. There are a lot of providers currently on the market, and sometimes it’s difficult to tell them apart. A quality SQL web hosting service should offer you the following:

* Reliability
* Control Panel Options
* Technical Support
* Customer Support
* Multiple Hosting Plans

Overall, if you plan on maintaining a database online, your best option is to go with a web hosting service that has servers dedicated specifically to SQL applications. Doing so will ensure that you get the most value out of your investment. SQL web hosting may cost a little more than standard hosting, but it’s worth every penny.
