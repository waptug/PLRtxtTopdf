To avoid incurring additional debt, stay away from credit cards. Only use your credit cards to pay bills, and payoff your credit card as soon as possible to avoid high interest rates. Stay away from payday loans also, unless you see that you can avoid late fees and can payoff the loan right away. Keep in mind however, that payday lenders often attach a steep fee.

The above tips are just some of the many ways to keep out of debt and manage the debt that you already have. If you can manage your debt effectively you can save a massive amount of money over the years in interest.
