Stock markets work on risk. Every adventure sport has an element of risk. All commodity markets have a risk. Risk is an essential part of our life. We sleep peacefully at night without thinking about the probability of earthquake occurring in our area. The whole world is living with the risk of nuclear pile. But these are risks about which individuals can do nothing.

We as individuals can risk our money and at times our life. Let us talk only about money now. If you are in business, do you risk your money if the venture is little risky?

We take many risks without thinking about them. Only when something happens, we realize the extent to which we had risked.

Please find out the risk involved in every business decision you take. Calculate the probability of failure and success. Think about them carefully and then step ahead. Secure future has a great effect on our peace of mind.
