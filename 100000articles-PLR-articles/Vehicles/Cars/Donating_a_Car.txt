If you have a car that you know longer use you should consider donating it to a good cause.  Many people are unaware that it is even possible to donate cars.  In turn they simply end up taking their car to the junkyard instead.  Why give your car to the junkyard for pennies, when you can donate it to help people that are in need? 

The good thing about donating a car is that there are a lot of benefits that go along with it that you may not even be aware of.  First off, it is important to know that you can donate your car even if it is not in perfect working condition.  With a little bit of work your car can probably get running again and lend assistance in more ways than one.  In addition, you never have to worry about driving your car to the donation center or paying for towing.  They will always come to you to pick the car up; no questions asked.   

To take service a step further, donation centers are also willing to work with you in order to ensure that everything goes off smoothly from the start.  They offer quick service and prompt attention so that you do not have to go out of your way to ensure that your car is picked up on time, etc.  When you donate your car there is also a minimal amount of paperwork that you have to deal with; this makes the process even quicker.   

Donating a car can also be used as a large IRS tax deduction.  Many people are not aware of this, but it is one of the best reasons to donate your car to charity or any other cause.  Tax deductions can go a long way in ensuring that you do not owe money at the end of the year. 

And of course the biggest benefit of donating a car is that you will be helping people that are in need.  Your car may go to a family that does not have any transportation, or the organization you donate it to may use it to deliver clothes, food, or furniture.  Either way, you can be rest assured that your donation is going to be put to good use.   

To find a charity or organization that accepts automobile donations you can simply go online or search the yellow pages.  You should not have any problems finding an organization in your area that would be ecstatic to take your car off your hands.  And if you cannot find anybody in your area, try somebody a bit further out.  Chances are that they will be just excited to help you out. 

Overall, if you have a car that you no longer use look into donating it.  The benefits that go along with this process are endless, and you will feel much better about yourself when everything is over and done.
