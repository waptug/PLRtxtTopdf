There are many aspects to consider when booking your ideal venue and, cost aside, the top of your priority list should always include; 

Location - a convenient and accessible location for your guests.

Room sizes - and appropriate room layouts to accommodate your guests in comfort.

Ambience - create the right atmosphere - high tech or historical, intimate or wow factor.

Catering - be it a breakfast buffet or an opulent dining experience, ensure your venue can cater for your requirements - especially if the food is prepared off the premises.

Technology - If required, check everything is available to you from broadband to power sockets. For presentations, make sure the view is not obscured.
 
Lighting and heating - heating should be controllable and some degree of natural light is usually preferred.

Breakout rooms - check that additional space is available should you need it.

Additional facilities - consider the additional requirements of your guests, e.g. availability of overnight accommodation for those travelling a long distance.

Central London offers a multitude of hotels and serviced buildings catering from the smallest groups to the largest conferences and banquets, and although most are efficient and serve their purpose, if you’re looking for a unique and affordable venue, rich in history and character, you may have to dig a little deeper.

One example is 41 Portland Place, situated in the heart of London’s West End.

41 Portland Place is a Grade II listed building and in the eighteenth century was the home of Sir Thomas Gage, a leading figure in the American War of Independence (albeit on the losing side!). Sir Thomas Gage was one of the first occupants of the grand new houses in Portland Place, and moved here in 1779, whilst the street was still under construction. He lived in the house until his death in 1787. His widow Margaret continued to do so until 1792.

Although no longer a private residence, 41 Portland Place still retains much of the style and atmosphere of an 18th Century home and is decorated and furnished with antiques from the period.  The private rooms are arranged on the ground and first floors with capacities ranging from 2 to 120.  One of the first floor dining rooms opens onto an attractive roof terrace.

41 Portland Place is conveniently located in the centre of London and offers a high quality attractive and unique venue for private meetings, training, conferences, seminars, lunches and dinners. Many of the rooms are decorated and furnished to complement the original 18th century architecture of the building. 

The quality of the facilities is equalled matched by the high standard of catering provided.  From the simplest of buffets to a smart cocktail reception or from relaxed lunches to haute cuisine dinners, the unrivalled standards of service and the minute attention to detail will make for an occasion to savour.
