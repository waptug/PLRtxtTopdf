Article Body:
Sweden is a great region, and Swedish food is a great ethnic food.  At 
its best, Swedish food is excellent, largely meat-, fish- and potato-based, but 
varied and generally tasty and filling.  

Typically classical Swedish cooking includes lots of seafood, herring in 
particular; open faced sandwiches; and Swedish meatballs, a smörgåsbord 
favorite: Swedish meatballs (köttbullar).

If you equate Swedish food with smorgasbord, meatballs and dill, think again!  Although these are great delights, you'll enjoy a wide range of tasty, fresh-cooked food in Sweden.  However, for those who prefer the authentic taste of Sweden, here's my favourite recipe:-

<b>Farmors Köttbullar</b>

1lb of minced beef
onion - finely chopped
1 cup of soft breadcrumbs or oats
1 egg
Milk (about 1/2 decilitre)

Soak oats or breadcrumbs in milk for 1/2 hour
Add mince and mix until smooth and well blended together
Add onion - mix well
Finally add egg and salt and pepper
Roll into little balls and fry in margarine for about 10 minutes

Served kottbullar with freshly mashed potato (potatismos) and a salad.  Enjoy!

Many thanks to Ulla who shared this genuine Swedish recipe with our family.
