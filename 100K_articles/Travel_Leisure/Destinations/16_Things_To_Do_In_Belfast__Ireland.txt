If you are looking for a nice get-a-way weekend, with all the charm of a country town and yet all the opportunities of a thriving city, then Belfast is a wonderful place to relax and enjoy life! Belfast is the second largest city in Ireland, Dublin being the largest, and with a population of over 200,000 it is filled with the charm of an old town shipping port alongside a thriving metropolis.  Belfast originated centuries ago as a shipping passage through the Irish Sea, protected on one side by Ireland and the other by England. Today it is quickly gaining the reputation as being the place to go for “a break”, even more than Glasgow or London!  Once you get here, either by boat or plane, you have a choice either to stay inside your bed and breakfast, or get out and see what Belfast has to offer.

Whether you take a weekend, a week or three weeks, there is plenty for you and your family to do.  If you need a rest, you can always slip down to the beach for a relaxing afternoon walking the shoreline and soaking up the sun.  But once you come to Belfast, you’ll see why it is becoming the get-a-way city of Ireland.
