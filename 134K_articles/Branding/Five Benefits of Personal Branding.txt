Five Benefits of Personal Branding
Personal Branding is about honing your skills, narrowing your focus, and getting clear on what you're passionate about. 
Branding is not just about you being better than your competition. It's about getting your prospects to choose you as the ONLY solution to their problem.
Here are five great benefits of creating a strong personal brand: 
*One of the greatest benefits to you of having a strong brand is that it creates a sense of individuality and "separateness" in the marketplace so that your clients are able to easily differentiate your company from your competitors.
 *The goal of personal branding is to be known for who you are as a person and what you stand for. Your brand is a reflection of who you are, your opinions, values, and beliefs that are visibly expressed by what you say and do, and how you do it. 
*The branding process allows you to take control of your identity and influence the perception others will have about you and the services you offer.
 *A strong personal brand will enable you to effortlessly attract clients and opportunities. You will position yourself in the mind of your marketplace as THE service provider of choice to dominate your market and command higher fees - work less and make more!
*Establish yourself as an expert and become a celebrity in your area of specialty. Gain name recognition in your area of expertise where it counts the most - in your customer's mind. Make a lasting impression and be super-rewarded for your individuality.
Trust, respect, and admiration will follow when your name and message are embedded repeatedly into the consciousness of your target market. You will be perceived as an expert the more you are visible to your target audience. Your brand will propel you to the top in your marketplace.
