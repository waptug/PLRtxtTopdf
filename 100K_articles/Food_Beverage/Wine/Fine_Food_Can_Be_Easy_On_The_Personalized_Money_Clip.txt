Food is a necessity, but sadly, fine dining is a luxury, and from the name itself, a very fine one at that. It is a luxury afforded by the rich and famous, and one that you can have too. All it takes is a great appreciation of good food and excellent wine, and a bit of extra cash in your personalized money clip.

Worth the Wait

Everybody knows that good food, like good wine, takes time. You’ll know that you’re in a particularly good restaurant if it takes them awhile to prepare your meal. Food that takes time to prepare often comes out perfectly and is well worth the wait and anticipation. It will look perfect, smell perfect, and taste perfect, and it will be worth every penny in your personalized money clip. 

Good Value for Money

Though most fine cuisines in the world can weigh heavily on your personalized money clip, there are some that are actually quite affordable. They’re so reasonably priced that you’ll barely notice the change in the contents of your personalized money clip. 

Western and European cuisine are often expensive. Eating French foie gras, Italian pizza and pasta, or English steak and kidney pies can cause a large dent on your personalized money clip. This is due to the fact that cost of living is so much higher in these countries and most ingredients have to be exported; therefore, food is only cooked with the finest cuts of meat, the freshest and hardest to find vegetables, and imported spices. These are also known as posh food and are mostly patronized by well-to-do Westerners.

Eastern and Oriental cuisine, on the other hand, will barely make a difference in your personalized money clip. Street food such as Thailand’s pad thai, China’s dumplings, India’s curries, and Japan’s sushi are a mere few pennies, dollar wise. Ingredients are grown locally, even in backyards, so the inflation of prices for spices, meats, and vegetables are virtually unheard of. 

Most Westerners would hesitate from digging in to this kind of food, and understandably so. These are mostly spicy and may not always be particularly clean. It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you’ve acquired the taste and your system has adjusted to the rich flavors and strong spices, you won’t be left wanting for anything else. Social standing is proving inconsequential in the pursuit of good food. It doesn’t matter how much money you have. You can enjoy fine dining regardless. Indeed, your personalized money clip does not have to suffer in pursuit of good food. It’s just a matter of knowing exactly where to look and digging in without hesitation.

Food for Thought

There’s nothing like a finely cooked meal or a richly prepared banquet to enhance the senses. Whether you have a fat personalized money clip or a thin one, you have every right to enjoy good food and to dine in the finest way possible. After all, good food should be a right and not a privilege.
