So just how new is this idea of product placement? It's not new at all really. It's commonly known in the industry that the product launch of Hershy's Reeses Pieces was jump started through product placement in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, but it goes back even farther than that -- Mobil oil used it in a 1949 film featuring Harpo Marx called Love Happy.

Product placement is well outside of the budget of most businesses but if you think creatively, you can find ways to use small scale product placement in your favor. A sports drink manufacturer could provide free products to an up and coming athlete, a furniture company could lend their furniture for the set of an independent film, or a clothing company could offer their outfits for a music video. What can your business do?
