The CD label market is on an upward swing since the explosion of computer awareness and release of user-friendly printing software on the market. People are eagerly switching to easy and innovative ways of CD labeling, and companies are investing money in research to come up with even faster and more user-savvy labeling options. The CD label makers are also cashing in on the increasing laser and ink jet label market. 

Many methods are used to commercially label the CDs. Out of these, screen, offset, pad and flexographic printing are widely used. These involve large-scale processes used to label a huge quantity of CDs carrying the same pattern, or in the instance where exact matches of shades are required.

A number of CD labeling software programs available in the market enable you to use only a specific brand of paper. Using some innovative labelers like the Audio Label CD labeler, you can print your CD with any kind of paper. Similarly, there are CD label makers present in the industry which arrange the text of the label in such a way that it fits into the space you want, so the text never goes ‘off track’. This is particularly useful when you want to add a large track list and you can have the pleasure of admiring a neat label every time you use the machine.

Clip art is a rage with many businesses, and CD label makers are increasingly adding the art gallery in CD label machines. Users can quickly browse through the given images and insert the choicest figures and impressions on the labels.

Before placing your order with a commercial CD label maker, find out about his equipment and the technology he uses. Ask for some past references and ensure his shipment time. If you are ordering labels from some overseas suppliers you will have to calculate the costs involved in imports plus the time consumed in the delivery of your CD labels.
