Those who can't cook due to their tight schedule mostly order their meal from fast food restaurants. They just ring the delivery service, and the food will be delivered in just a few minutes, ready to be eaten. What an easy life.

Apart from its convenience, fast food is also known as unhealthy and a weight gainer. High calories, sodium and fat are the culprits of its unhealthiness. It's often lack of important vitamins and minerals too.

If you are among those who are reluctant to eat fast food, here are some tricks to help you eat nutritious and less fattening fast food.

* Choose the healthiest foods available in the menus. This will help you maintain your diet, as you will not be tempted to unhealthy food.
* Eliminate high fat and calorie sauces and dressing of your food.
* Instead of taking sodas, change it with water or low fat milk
* Eat not more than 1,500 calories a day
