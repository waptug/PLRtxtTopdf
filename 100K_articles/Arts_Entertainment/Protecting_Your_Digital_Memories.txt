Article Body:
Over the past few years, the world has seen a new craze for digital cameras and camcorders. People nowadays prefer digital cameras to the traditional ones, where printing of photos is required in order to view them. But digital cameras are more delicate and need better handling than their traditional counterparts. They are prone to electrical problems, mechanical wear and tear and shock impact. By using the proper camera bags, these digital cameras can be protected from the elements.
Camera bags come in various sizes, shapes and colors. But you need to wisely choose the camera bag that is most suitable for you. You should first ask yourself what kind of photographer you are. Are you the kind who travels a lot?? Or are you the kind who is more into metropolitan photography. These days, there is a camera bag for almost every occasion, whether it involves you taking a stroll or going deep sea diving. Whatever the occasion, there is a bag for it.
Before you decide to buy your bag, you need to spread out all your paraphernalia and estimate the amount of space that you will need, to store all of it. It is essential that you do this.
Many of you might go in for a bag that looks very suave. But I personally recommend protection over looks. Ensure that the bag has sufficient padding on the sides to protect the camera from those rough moments in the forest or while hiking. There are also several bags that cater to security needs. The Pacsafe 120 wire travel protection bag is designed to prevent tampering or theft. You can lock your bag to any pole or post and it is nearly impossible to break open the thick cords. This is ideal while travelling.
Another major player in the camera bags business is Lowepro. This manufacturer makes bags that can be split into several pieces. This enables you to allot an entire compartment to each of you lenses. The Lowepro Stealth reporter has been one of the more successful camera bags that have ever hit the markets. It has luggage space for a camera, lenses and other gadgets as well. It also has an inbuilt rain-protection flap that really comes in handy while outdoors. 
Avoid purchasing bags that look too trendy and bags that stand out of the ordinary. These bags automatically attract unwanted attention from potential thieves. Bags that are very bright colored or bags that are huge and have designer labels on them are likely victims of theft. 
It takes a certain amount of time before which you can decide which camera bag is the right one for you. It is not a decision that can be taken on the spot but must be carefully though about before purchase. So what are you waiting for? Go grab your gear and always remember that protection outweighs looks.
