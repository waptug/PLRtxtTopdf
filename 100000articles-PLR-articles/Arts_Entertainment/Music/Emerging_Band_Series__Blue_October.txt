Other members include: his brother Jeremy as the drummer, Ryan Delahoussaye playing multiple instruments, guitarist CB Hudson, and Matt Noveskey on bass. The group released their first album “The Answers,” in 1998 under the management of the Jusitn and Jeremy’s parents and was well received in their hometown of Houston. 

Blue October signed with Universal Records in 2000, but was released after their first and only album, Consent to Treatment, under the label. However, their third album, History for Sale was re-released under Universal after having unexpected sales success. One of their singes “Calling You” was featured on the American Wedding soundtrack, the third installment the wildly popular teen comedy American Pie series. 

Blue October’s next mainstream hit came in 2006 with the single “Hate Me.” The success of the band’s 2006 album called Foiled has led them to be featured as musical guests on late night television shows such as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Jimmy Kimmel Live, and The Late Show with David Letterman.
