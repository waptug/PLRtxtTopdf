However, there are chances that the new features could spoil your profile or cause much damage to the way you planned to create the web page. Under those circumstances, it is imperative for the Myspace account holder retains the original identity. Begin with the starter layout of the myspace page. Maintain the profile for at least two weeks and study what additional features can be added to it. To make an assessment of the additions to the layout, visit other sites and study the profiles carefully. The profiles are created on the basis of the character and the attitude of the individual. Some wish to let out their desires float in the form of the web page of the Myspace account. You decide what is best for you, whether to identify your individual identity or present the inside by streaming information on the layout.

For Myspace account holders to mask identity, the best way to create is a disguised profile. Most people these days use a disguised profile to keep their identity protected. Such people can bank on a variety of layouts that are of optimum use. The layout appears high tech in nature and futuristic. If the user wants to be a bit adventurous, then the photo can be masked to provide only a glimpse of the member. The masking should be carried out in such a manner that the entire image is not sent to the layout. For instance, only the eyes or certain key parts of the face can be highlighted while the rest are hidden for view from the public visitors. However, some people carry images that are not original. They present themselves in the form of others. For instances, people loving beauty, normally have images of Hollywood stars on the web page. Though it is illegal for Myspace users to have the images of renowned personalities on the web page layout, some follow it. However, it is advised that people do not post the images of well known personalities on the layout. The best way to mask one's identity is to keep the page free from any image. This will ensure that the identity is fully protected. Besides, there is no curiosity from the visitor to identify the user.

The layouts can also have images of their younger days. It is not necessary that the images should be latest, taken in the near time. Such images can be pasted on the default layout bearing the theme of your choice. There is no restriction for experimentation on the layout. The account holder has the liberty to add as many programs as possible. However, the duplication of the programs has to be avoided. You can also go in for preset model of layouts called standardized layouts.
