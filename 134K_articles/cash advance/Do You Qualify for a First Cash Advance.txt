Do You Qualify for a First Cash Advance?

There are not many requirements that cash advance companies ask for when their customers are applying for a cash advance loan, and First Cash Advance is no different from the other cash advance companies.  

These days you don’t need much in the way of requirements, all you need is to be over 18 years of age and earn over $1,200 a month, plus you will also need to be able to produce a few recent pay checks that confirm that you are a regular earner who can make the repayment structure that the cash advance company will go over with you when you are accepted for the cash advance loan.

Qualifying for a cash advance loan is simple for first time customers just so long as you meet the requirements, then you will be more than able to be granted a cash advance loan.  For a repeat customer, though, the process may become more difficult especially if they were a poor customer before who couldn’t keep up with the repayments.  

If that sounds like you, then you are more than likely going to be rejected for a cash advance loan and First Cash Advance will also suspend repeat customers who were unable to keep up with the repayments on previous loans.  If you are willing to keep up with the repayments, then they are willing to help you.

You have to understand that cash advance companies like First Cash Advance are trying to keep their business safe from customers who clearly can’t handle a cash advance loan.  They are letting those customers know that their budget does not support a cash advance, loan and that they need to review their budget before they can apply for a cash advance loan.  This is a tough but fair approach by these companies, but at the end of the day they want to be paid back.
