If you have more than one computer at home, you are probably better off connecting them or networking them together to use the same resources and receive the same internet connection.  A home network is very easy to build.  Here are some tips.

There are two main types of home networks, wired and wireless.  While wired home networks are popular, but they require you to run wires from one computer to another.  You might have to drill holes in a wall or run wire under the carpet.  

If you don’t want cords running all over the place, you can easily get rid of them with a wireless home network.  Wireless home networks are extremely simple to set up.  You only need a wireless router and a wireless networking card for each additional computer you would like to hook up.  Most wireless networks can send and receive data lightning fast at megabytes per second.  

Wireless networks are extremely inexpensive, you can hook up a few computers for less than $200.  The great part of wireless networks is that all computers on the wireless network can use the same internet or other resources such as a scanning machine and printer.  So if you are looking for a great way to share data and resources among your home computer, choose to build a home network.
