When selecting a web design agency, it goes without saying that you should take a look at the company’s own website in order to get a better idea of their skills and abilities.  Similarly, you should ask the company for some references and to provide you with the URL of other sites they have created.  Be certain to take the time to view several of these sites thoroughly in order to make sure they are user-friendly and are attractive.  In addition, you can get a general feel for the designer’s methods and style while viewing these sites.

Selecting a web design agency should go further than just viewing sites the agency has created.  In order to get a better idea of how the designer works, ask him or her to take a look at your current site if you have one and to offer suggestions.  This way, you can determine if the designer has the ability to think on his or her own and to offer creative input.  If you do not already have a website, select a few sites from the Internet and ask the designer what he or she thinks about the site and to offer suggestions for improvement.

Since you will have to work closely with the web site designer, you want to make sure that you can communicate clearly.  By viewing sites together and discussing them, you can get a better idea of whether or not you are on the same wavelength.  If you feel that the designer is truly listening to you and understands what you are looking for, you just might have found the right person to do the job.  If not, take the time to discuss your ideas with other designers.  There are plenty of web design agencies available and it is well worth your time to find the one that best suits the needs of you and your company.
