Eating Healthy

	Proper eating at home can make the difference in your child’s behavior during the school day.  If they have good nutrition at home it will give them the energy they need to get through the day, and give their brain what it needs to think.
	Children that don’t eat breakfast or don’t eat well can be too tired during the school day.  It is difficult to learn when you can’t stay awake.  Morning time can be a big rush out the door, but it is important to take the time for breakfast.  
	Stocking up on fast breakfast choices is easier than you think.  I usually cook a hot breakfast on the weekends and Monday mornings.  I make extra pancake batter for waffles or pancakes and freeze the cooked item.  I lay out each pancake or waffle flat on a cookie sheet until they are frozen and then toss them in a freezer baggie.  They keep their shape because they are frozen and my kids can pop them in the toaster for breakfast.  There are other ideas you can come up with to make breakfast easier.  
	It’s easy to provide a nutritious breakfast in the midst of the morning scuttle.  My kids usually fix cereal before I get up in the morning.  If this happens in your home as well, supplement the cereal with some orange juice or other fruit drink.  Add toast with jam or try some slices of fresh fruit with their cereal.
	There are many products on the market that make breakfast fast and simple.  Breakfast bars can provide many nutrients that are needed for healthy bodies.  Adding milk or juice can give an extra boost.  Make sure whatever you fix for breakfast will fill your child up until lunch and will give them the energy they need.
