Company Hi-jacking
Every company registered at companies house in the UK is now facing a new threat to their business in the form of 'Company Hi-Jacking'. This is when a company's identity is stolen by fraudsters. These criminals simply submit a forged form to Companies House, changing a company's registered address to a new location.

Using the selected company's name and the new address, they are then able to carry out fraudulent activities, obtaining credit to purchase goods and services. This form of fraud is estimated to cost £50 million a year to industry.
