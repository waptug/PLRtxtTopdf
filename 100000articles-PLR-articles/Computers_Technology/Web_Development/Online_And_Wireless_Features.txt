The online and wireless features offered through billion-dollar corporations may seem like little rewards that will make life a lot easier for millions. People love to select features for the cellular telephone because these little additions seem to personalize the little piece of electronic machinery. The online and wireless features will in fact, complicate life more than the small benefits the consumer gets by relieving the strain by using these small and insignificant entertainment features.

The cost of installing ringtones into a cellular telephone might surprise some users when the first bill arrives. These online and wireless features are at times, only bits and pieces of songs that can also be heard in their entirety on the local radio stations. The disenchantment for ringtones will begin when the customer realizes that every ringtone will increase the bill by $.150 or more. The customer will also be charged for airtime used to download the ringtone to the cellular phone.

Some cellular telephone users will focus on the most productive online and wireless features they have. The voice plans, voice and data plans, and wireless pc card options will make cellular telephone customers feel like they are in charge of controlling the cellular telephone cost of ownership. Cellular telephone customers that do not understand the charges and fees associated with the online and wireless features they use on the phone will incur high bills.

The cellular telephone customer that chooses the basic calling plan might find that it does not provide enough minutes. The online websites for the brand name online and wireless service providers will place per-minute amounts for every call that exceeds the minutes in the chosen calling plan. Some of those per-minute charges could accrue bill amounts that could be more than some cell users can manage to pay for in a month.

Without payment in hand, the online and wireless service provider will turn off service with no further ado, and send a bill out with a charge for a $175 deactivation fee. The features that were thought to be so popular will now seem like a ball and chain because of the charges that they bring to a cellular telephone bill and that burden is one that consumers will tire of carrying one day. Some cellular telephone users might try another carrier for online and wireless service and use the features on the phone more responsibly.

A basic ring and an answered call are just the basic features that cellular telephone users need today. Parents are finding that online and wireless features such as text messaging are charges that they can live without. Many cellular telephone users are reconsidering the online and wireless features that they use and are deleting those that connect them to the internet.

Some believe that those feature charges are out of step with the needs of cellular telephone users. Perhaps the billion dollar online wireless service providers could simplify bills and provide one amount for all services they offer and consumers could then relax and enjoy the service that they are paying for.
