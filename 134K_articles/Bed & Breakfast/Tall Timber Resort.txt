Tall Timber Resort

Durango, Colorado, is the home of one of the best family resorts in the country, Tall Timber Resort.

The historic Silverton train, which winds through scenic forests and canyons, is one of only two ways to get to this hideaway.  The other way is by helicopter.  The accommodations are just as inspiring as the way you arrive.  Two-story condominium units with rustic wood paneling and stone fireplaces include three meals a day and round-trip transportation from Durango..

Besides the daily three meals, coffee is available in all rooms.  Children between the age of three and twelve stay for half the price.  Cribs are provided free for all who wish one.  Box lunches are made available for those adventurers who wish to go on available helicopter picnics.  Other activities include numerous hiking trails and cross country skiing.

For those preferring quieter activities, there is an indoor/outdoor pool, a library, lawn games a whirlpool and a sauna. Then there is the adventure of a lifetime for the most adventurous at heart, the zip line adventure.

With the aid of a Sky Ranger, a guest dons his or her harness and is safety checked.  It takes about four and a half hours to soar between 32 stainless steel platforms by traversing over a mile of helicopter-grade stainless steel cable through 27 ponderosa pines, allowing time to relax in the trees to enjoy a gourmet lunch.  Spans range from 50 feet to 500 feet apart, soaring guests through Aspen forest and even across the Animas River.  There are breathtaking views along the way, and each platform offers something different, including being air-lifted by a helicopter hoist, and having a Sky Guide rappel guests down to the forest floor. 

There truly is something for everyone at Colorado's Tall Timber Resort.  It is one vacation your family will talk about for years.
