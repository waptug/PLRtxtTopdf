Finding the perfect gift for dad can be pretty difficult in my family. My father is not the kind of guy who is easy to shop for, and with Christmas approaching, I was starting to get just a little bit worried I had already used up all of the normal gift ideas for dad. I had gotten him a watch the year before, a nice pocket knife the year before that, and all sorts of other doodads and gizmos on his birthdays. 

I wanted to do something different this year. I wanted to get a gift for father that would really blow him away.  Most of the gifts for dads that people buy are pretty cliché, and I thought that my father deserved something better. The problem was that I could not think of something that would stick and capture his interest.

When I started looking at Christmas gifts, however, I found a lot of different ideas. I thought about getting a gift for dad from one of those online stores the specializes in personalized gifts. I could get him a pen set with his name written on it, or maybe get an engraved photo album to help him to organize all of the pictures he had been trying to put together.

It took me a while, but finally I settled on the perfect gift for Dad. It was actually a much more run of the mill sort of present than I had wanted to get him, but it was perfect. It was a warm, thick, and comfortable sweater that I knew would just look perfect on him. I trusted my instincts and bought it right away.

When I gave it to him at Christmas, he was really happy with it. My dad is one of those fathers who does not show a lot of emotion for the most part, but I could tell that I had made the right choice this time. He came right up to me and gave me a great big hug, thanking me for what he felt was a very considerate present. Ever since then, he wears that sweater almost every time that the weather turns cold. It seems like it has become one of his very favorite things to wear. It is nice to know that my gift for dad was appreciated. After all, there is nothing more satisfying than really doing something to make your old man happy, don’t you think?
