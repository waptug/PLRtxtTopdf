Most people shudder at the thought of Forex Trading because they think that it is very high risk trading because of the great amount of leverage involved. However the money making potential in Forex Trading is huge when compared to other financial instruments worldwide.

This article will highlight three great reasons why you should consider Forex Trading or at least a managed Forex Trading Account when considering between the multitude of investment instruments available on the market today.

Firstly, the forex market is the most liquid financial market in the world today. This means practically that even in a falling or rising market, there will always be a ready buyer or seller on the market. Most of us have been caught in situations where we want to sell a stock but there are no ready buyers in a falling market.

The great amount of liquidity in the forex market today, means that not only can you sell your currency fast but you can also acquire it fast as well and in rapid succession. That’s one reason why George Soros managed to funnel large amounts of money through the several South East Asian currencies during the currency crisis and made huge amounts of money in the process.

Secondly, the forex market is a true global market meaning that it operates 24/7 during the weekdays. This means that if you really wanted to, you could trade through the night and the day. Thankfully there is forex trading software now that helps you monitor trades and hunt for good trading opportunities and when you just enter your trading strategy, and the robot takes over and closes your position for you. The trading platforms now are so robust that you can set your downside indicators to close your position when it falls below a pre-set number so that you do not lost money even while you are sleeping.

Thirdly, the Forex Market is controlled by macro economic factors. Currencies are representations of how strong the economies are and how global trade affects them. The US Dollar rises and falls against the Euro in response to how strong the US economy is. Central bank intervention also plays a large role in this matter and such details are readily known to anyone today with internet access. You would want to contrast this to stock markets where the fund managers are usually the first to know about a scandal or bad quarter as opposed to the main retail investors. Another aspect of marco economics is that currency trends take a long time to play out. This means practically that we will not be caught off guard so fast when there is a turn in the market which takes a few years to play out.

In conclusion, we have highlighted three reasons why you should consider Forex Trading as a possible way to make money online. Take some time this weekend and go to the library and read all you can on the subject and then practice as much as you can with the free simulated accounts that most forex trading brokers provide and only spend money when you have accumulated enough profitable paper trading. Remember with great risk comes great reward in the Forex Trading Market. Carpe Diem!
