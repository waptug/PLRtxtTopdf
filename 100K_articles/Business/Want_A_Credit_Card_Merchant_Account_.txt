Who doesn’t want a credit card merchant account! This special service allows you to process credit card payments from your clients in a number of ways that can help to speedily grow your business. A merchant account has been known to double or triple business profits in a relatively short amount of time, so only if your company is poised for growth should you consider this exciting opportunity. 

If you currently work with a bank that you trust with your business concerns, ask about the possibility of applying for a credit card merchant account. Most companies are eager to welcome this type of business from customers they know and trust. As long as you have established a solid business credit history, pay your bills in a timely manner, and aren’t involved in questionable or unethical pursuits, your chances of being approved for a merchant account are good. Of course, your bank may not offer this type of account, or you may be able to find better terms with another lender, so don’t feel as though you must apply for merchant services with your current lender. Instead, ask around at trade shows, conventions, or civic business meetings to see what type of merchant account providers your competitors are using. They can probably offer helpful tips on which lenders to court and which ones to avoid. You also can check with local business listings for references on general lenders, some of which may offer merchant accounts. Or you can browse the Internet to bring up a list of links that will let you contact those that seem most compatible with your business interests. 

Getting a credit card merchant account is pretty easy. After locating potential lenders to work with, you should compare services and fees to make sure they will work with the business plan that you are using or one that you plan to set up. Check your company’s budget to find out how much you can afford to invest in credit card processing equipment and service options. Then compare your budget with transactional fees, maintenance expenses, and application or gateway rates to find a lender that is affordable for your needs. 

When you have been approved for a credit card merchant account, you can start to accept credit card payments from your clients immediately, often with a couple of days. All you need to do is select the type of processing equipment that best fits with your customers’ purchasing patterns. For example, if most visit your store to shop, an onsite credit card processor that you can purchase for a few hundred dollars is the simplest and perhaps most effective way to start. But if you deliver goods and services, a wireless unit might be the better choice. Of course, if you do both, two units might be affordable, but you will need to check your budget. You can always start with one and add another later.
