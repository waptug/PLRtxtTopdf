Consider this situation: a man walking down the street noticed an attractive spring overcoat in a clothier’s window. The material, the cut and everything about the overcoat strikes him right. But there is no price card in the window and even though he wonders what the overcoat’s price is, his interest in the coat is not strong enough to induce him to enter the store and inquire. He is like any other shopper who knows that somewhere along he will see another overcoat just like the one he saw with the price displayed with it. And if this happens, the dealer who advertised with the price won the customer and the other who did not lost a deal.

Keep in mind that money makes the loudest noise in the commercial world. It is the most powerful of all arguments and enticements. That is why prices should be included in every advertisement that aims to sell goods. Think about this: when you see an overcoat or a shirt that you like, the first thing that comes to your mind is “how much?” When this thought is met to your satisfaction with the price tags included in the products, you can immediately invest to you own and perhaps the dealers benefit. The most successful businesses understand the importance of having printed prices. They save the necessity of asking question, thus, they facilitate easy shopping. 

Aside from having the prices attached to the products in the store, another best place to include them is in the catalog. By and large, catalogs contain the description of the product, some pictures and the price. Most consumers would request for a catalog before purchasing. When you have a catalog at hand, you will immediately be able to provide your customer what he needs and as a result you will have a successful sale. 

Understand that a great and unique design is the first that is being noticed in catalogs. Hence, when you are able to create a visually appealing catalog it can speak in behalf of you and your business. In the past, only a few retailers use catalogs to showcase their products. But today, almost all businesses use catalogs to catch the attention of their target customers. 

Thus, prices are absolutely necessary. Every customer, whether a man, woman or child, wants at first sight to learn the price of goods in which he or she may be interested. And as a business owner you should deliver your advertising in an easy, cultivated manner. The items, arguments and prices will make a better and long lasting impression when delivered in this tone. So, give clear, clever and satisfactory details in your items and never forget your best prices. When you have done this you can rest easy that your adverting is just right.
