Yes cheesecake can be frozen and it freezes very well, if you are having a party next week and you won't have time to prepare your cheesecake at that time, as I'm sure you won't, you can bake your cheesecake a week or so in advance and freeze it, but you must package it properly, but not by wrapping it with tin foil as many people do.

Tin foil is a metal and will cause freezer burn, what you need to do is place your cheesecake in a freezer for 4 to 5 hours just to get it really cold, remove it and wrap it with a plastic film wrap and place it in a freezer bag, try to get all the air from the bag.
Now place the wrapped cheesecake back to the freezer and let it alone until you need it.

The day of your party take your cheesecake from the freezer and unwrap it, place it in a container that fits it well and place it in your refrigerator until you are ready to use it ,it only takes a few hours to thaw out.
By freezing your cheesecake you have so much more time to devote to other things for your party, do you need a good recipe for a real gourmet cheesecake then go to.
