Article Body:
The DYMO brandname is synonymous with labelling solutions for small/medium/large organizations - from work-at-home-moms, up to Fortune 500 companies. Dymo label machines have been available for over 30 years and constant innovations keep leading Dymo to release more useful and solution-orientated labelling products. Just like the 'jewel in the crown' Dymo LabelWriter Twin Turbo. This little marvel is unlike any other label printer ever released by Dymo. That's because it is not just a label printer... it is in fact two label printers sharing the same body, it solves a big problem (see below) and does this at a very affordbale price.

When the Dymo LabelWriter Twin Turbo was finally released it was, as expected, an instant hit. But to understand why it has been so successful, it is important to first get a bit of an understanding of label printers in general.....

Almost every label printer that has ever been sold on the open market has only had a single printhead and the capacity to hold just a single roll of labels. This doesn't sound too odd because label printers are simple purpose-built machines for doing nothing other than 'printing labels'. You type a label, you print a label.... fast and simple. But when a user needs to print to a different label 'size' or 'shape', a problem exists. You either need to change out the roll of labels that is in the printer, or just have another printer with the other size/shape labels in it. 

Hence the calling for the Dymo LabelWriter Twin Turbo !!

Dymo listened very closely to feedback from existing customers, many of whom typically had 2 label sizes that they printed constantly, and were annoyed at having to keep changing the rolls out. So the idea of having 2 rolls in the one machine seemed like the obvious solution, and it has proven to be.

Along the way, Dymo stumbled across another advantage of having the 2-roll capacity. Suppose you only had one label size that you printed on. Most would think that the Twin Turbo would not suit them, but Dymo added a feature where, in the case the first roll of labels ran out, the printer would automatically switch to the second roll of labels and continue to print..... pure genius !

The Dymo LabelWriter is normally priced at $155 from Labelcity.com, but there is a full $30 instant discount being offered, dragging the price down to $125... which takes it to 52% off MSRP. The deal is valid from April 20-30, 2006 (inclusive) and is available only from <a href="http://www.labelcity.com">Labelcity.com</a>
