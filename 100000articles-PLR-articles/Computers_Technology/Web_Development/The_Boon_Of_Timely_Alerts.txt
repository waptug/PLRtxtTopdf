Everybody benefits from a timely reminder or two. We invest in planners. We make notes on our mobile phones. We stick post-its on our refrigerators. We never know when we might forget a deadline. It is best to be prepared to deal with all possibilities. Of course, reminders are not merely limited to our personal lives. At work also, we need reminders about a variety of things. Moreover, we may also need to remind those who we share work space with - our colleagues, subordinates, and superiors. And communicating personally with each individual is often rather impracticable.

Thus, on the work front at least, it certainly would be sensible to subscribe to some email reminder service. This is certainly a great way of communicating with a large number of people. Reminders sent via email are a great way to jog the memories of the people you work with. As it is everyone is constantly on the Internet no matter what one's field of work may be. Hence, most people find themselves going to their mailboxes many times each day. Thus, an email reminder is a sure-fire way of making sure that your workmates are aware of when the next conference is.

However, if one is looking to send off a very urgent piece of news, using a text messaging service might be a better choice. Email reminders are read only when the person concerned decides to check his mail. However, a text message sent on a mobile phone alerts the mobile phone owner immediately. Most of us are lost without our mobile phones. They carry them around practically everywhere. Hence, an SMS messaging service might be quite a good option when it comes to sending out urgent messages and wanting immediate response. 

Reminding people about dates and deadlines has really become too easy. The fast pace of modern life has led to the need for instant communication at all times. As a result, most corporate organizations are becoming aware of the need to subscribe to a reliable email reminder service or an efficient SMS messaging service. While the former is a good choice for communicating with people who are almost always on the net, the latter is the best option for reminding people who are constantly on the go. A text message service may not be as inexpensive as an email reminder service. However, it provides the advantage of instantly informing the person concerned. After all, a reminder that is late has no value at all.
