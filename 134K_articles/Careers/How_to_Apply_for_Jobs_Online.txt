<b>Responding to an Ad</b>

Once you find an ad that sounds interesting, ask yourself, “Do my skills, qualifications, and experience make me a good candidate for this position?”  If the answer is yes, you are ready to respond to the ad.

Chances are many other job seekers found the same advertisement equally as appealing and will vie for the position, too. For that reason, filling out the online application in such a way as to grab the employer’s attention is a must. Don’t just fill in requested responses; give your responses depth. Remember, the application is in essence a job interview. You want to present yourself as intelligent, bright, and just the right person for the position. 

Many employers prefer that job applicants use their company application. Still, you want to make your application unique, to avoid being swallowed up in a growing pile of other applications.

<b>Filling out the Online Application</b>

The National Association of Colleges and Employers recently conducted a survey, posing the question to employers, “How does one make an electronic application outstanding?”  At the top of the list was “<i>follow directions…be careful to enter the correct data in the correct field</i>.”  

Advice that sounds so simple and basic, it barely seems worth mentioning, yet it is a critical first-step through the door of opportunity. You’d be surprised the number of online applicants who rush through the process, and send the application on its way without going over it a second time. Why would any employer consider hiring someone that didn’t take the time to be sure their application was filled out properly?

The second piece of advice was to tailor the application information to fit the position, instead of copy and pasting text from a generic resume. Use key words, buzz words, and industry jargon – taking cues from the verbiage in the job advertisement as your model. 

This is a very important aspect of filling out the online application, because employers do a keyword search when looking for people to fill specific employment positions.

Be specific when asked to describe past employment duties. Instead of saying, “<i>I counted cash drawers</i>,” say “<i>I counted 7 cash drawers daily</i>.”  Instead of “<i>oversaw secretary pool</i>,” say “<i>oversaw a secretary pool consisting of 6 full-time and 3 part-time employees</i>.”

<b>What about the Comments Field?</b>

Complete all fields, even if they aren’t required. If the application doesn’t include a job skills-inventory section, create one. This could go in the comments section.

Another use for the comments section is to demonstrate your knowledge of the company or industry. Research it as thoroughly as possible to show your earnest interest in the position for which you are applying.

And above all else, proof read the application before sending it on its way. Do a spell check from your word processor before copying and pasting text in the appropriate field. Also check for grammatical errors.

Remember, when you apply for jobs online through employee/employer matchmaking resources such as istaffsolution.com, the online application will be the employer’s first impression of you. Make sure it is a good one!
