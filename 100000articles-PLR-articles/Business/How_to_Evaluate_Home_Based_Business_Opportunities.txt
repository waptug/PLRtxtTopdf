With the economy in flux, and whispers of recession turning into frank discussions of how long the downturn is expected to last, it's no wonder that more people than ever before are taking a second look at home based businesses. For some, the ability to make money online is a way to make ends meet as the costs of everything from fuel to food spiral upward. For others, being able to work from home is the best of both worlds: they can earn a decent income while being able to greet the kids when they get home from school. Virtually everyone appreciates a home based business' flexible hours and lack of a commute, as well as the rewarding feeling that comes from creating your own financial security.

As appealing as a home based business is, it's often difficult to evaluate programs. After all, there are hundreds - if not thousands - of opportunities available. Here are five tips to help you separate the best from the rest.

1. Find reputable online reviews. There are websites that specialize in guiding would-be home based business owners toward legitimate opportunities. The best sites offer valuable information so that you can make money at home, as well as essential website marketing tools.

2. Free vs. paid. There are both paid and free home based business opportunities. If you have money to invest in your business, paid opportunities can often reap greater financial rewards. That's not to say, however, that you can't make money at home from a free home based business. You simply need to understand the potential risks and rewards associated with each type.

3. Passive vs. active. When evaluating opportunities, it's important to know how much time you have to devote to your business. Some require actively selling products or services, while others rely on utilizing marketing tools to harness the power of the Internet and create a passive income stream. Many people find that the most lucrative home based businesses fall somewhere in the middle, enabling them to work minimal hours while maximizing income.

4. Diverse revenue streams. Although the ability to make money online has been around for several years now, the path to success is constantly evolving. Those in the know recommend diversifying your home base business revenue streams. In other words, you should launch several different types of online businesses to ensure that if one source of revenue slows, another can make up the difference. Like the old saying, "Don't put your eggs all in one basket," diversification is key. 

5. Start small and plan to grow. If you're new to home based businesses, it's going to take a bit of time to learn the ropes. The challenges are by no means insurmountable, but you'll still need to get your systems in place, develop a game plan, and become proficient in your new venture. Most experts recommend that you begin with one opportunity, master that, and then add another. The ramp-up period varies from person to person, but most people are able to launch one home based business per month, and then add about one per month.

Once you find the right opportunities and the right fit, becoming a successful home based business entrepreneur isn't difficult. In fact, it's probably one of the most rewarding efforts you'll ever undertake.
