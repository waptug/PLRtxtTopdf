RegCure completed its registry scan on our test system in just under 3 minutes, and found a total of 822 errors. It also the speed and efficiency of our computer by a measurable 15% (test video of RegCure can be seen on our website link below), the results were very noticeable.

Removal of detected items was simple, and you had the option of going down the list manually and only checking those Registry items for removal that you wanted. RegCure also featured an Ignore List: After a scan you can add detected items to the Ignore list. In these instances, RegCure does not remove the item and it will be ignored during upcoming scans.

RegCure also came equipped with scheduling functionality so that your windows registry is scanned automatically on a regular basis. Once certain of your scan settings you can set up one or more schedules to automate the scanning and removal process. We found this feature particulalry useful during our review of RegCure.
