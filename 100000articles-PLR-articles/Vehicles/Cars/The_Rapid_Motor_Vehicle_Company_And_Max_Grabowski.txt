In 1902 Max Grabowski founded a company called the "Rapid Motor Vehicle Company", which developed some of the earliest commercial trucks ever designed. In 1909 the company was bought by General Motors to form the basis of the General Motors Truck Company, from which GMC Truck was made. In 1912 the name "GMC Truck" was first shown at the New York Auto Show.

 In 1996 GM dropped the word 'truck' from the GMC Truck name, thus creating the GMC name as we know it today. There never was a Grabowski Motor Company or a Grabowski Motor Corp. 

They now make personal automobiles, as well as pickup truck and bus engines.
