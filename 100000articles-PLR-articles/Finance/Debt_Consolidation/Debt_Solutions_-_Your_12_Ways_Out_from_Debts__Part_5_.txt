<b>Home Equity Loan</b> 

Home equity loan is a type of loan where you can borrow money against the value of your equity. The equity in your property can be calculated by deducting the outstanding mortgage on your home from the market value of your home, the remaining balance is the equity, which is what you would have left over in the event that you sold your property at market value and repaid your outstanding mortgage. A home equity loan enables you to unlock that equity and get the money you need without having to actually sell your home. 

In most cases these loans offer attractive rates and low payment schemes. Hence, if you have equity and because of the low interest rate, you actually can pledge your equity to get a home equity loan to payoff your debt. Some lenders will let you borrow up to certain percentage of your equity, such as 80%, but there are lenders who will allow you to borrow up to 100% of your equity value. 

<b>Credit Card Balance Transfer</b> 

If you have a good credit rating, you actually can ask for a lower interest rate from your current credit card issuers. Contact your current credit card issuers and ask for their interest rate if you transfer your other credit card balances over to theirs. You may request for a fixed rate and request them to waive any processing or transfer fees. If you can&#39;t negotiate low interest rate with your current credit card issuers, try to get a new card which could offer what you want. Then, transfer all you credit card balances to this new card. You do consolidate this way, be sure to set up an optimal payment plan so that you can be free of debts by paying off all your debt. 

<b>Bankruptcy</b> 

Bankruptcy should only be you very last resort solution when you really can&#39;t find other solutions. Although declaring bankruptcy is the faster debt relief to wipe off all your debts from your bill statement, bankruptcy has many undesirable consequences that will follow you for many years; it will remain on your credit report for 7-10 years. 

There are two common types of bankruptcy filling: Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. Most people who file for bankruptcy choose Chapter 7 instead of Chapter 13 because it&#39;s fast, effective, easy to file, and doesn&#39;t require payments over time. 

Seeing the consequences of bankruptcy, a debtor should always try to avoid filling bankruptcy and source for other debt relief alternatives. But if this is your last ultimate option for debt relief, with a little work, you can improve your credit and recover yourself after bankruptcy.
