When it comes to making a car purchase, paying for it is a big part of the battle. Even mid level new cars run into the $20,000 range. Because of these prices, few people pay cash for cars anymore and statistically about 7 out of every 10 people use car finance to pay for their new vehicle. In order to get the best car finance possible, you need to understand how the whole process work.

First, you want to figure out where you are going to get your car finance. There are a number of institutions that can get you financing. Banks, credit unions, the dealership, or even auto manufacturers can provide financing for your new or used vehicle.

Second, with a car finance, you need to realize that whether you buy a new or used vehicle will affect your financing. As a general rule, interest rates will be lower on new cars than on used ones. Also, new cars can often qualify for financing over a longer period of time than can used cars.

Next, when it comes to our car finance, don’t believe everything you see or read. Commercials for special financing for those who are first time buyer or have bad credit abound in papers and on the television. These are usually a little too good to come true and come attached with requirements such as extra high down payments and extremely high interest rates. In some cases, both apply to the loan.

Before you go to get your loan, make sure you know about your own credit history. Get a copy of your credit report and go over it with a fine toothed comb. Look at the score as well as the payment histories on it. If anything at all looks incorrect, make sure you get it cleared up. When a lender looks at how much money to give you, they will check out your debt ratios, how long you have been at your job, your history with similar loans, and your credit report as a whole.

Once you are armed and ready to consider your car finance, shop around. It is usually a good idea to look for the financing before you buy the car. You will better know what you qualify for that way. Also, you can use your information to bargain further with the dealer. In order for them to finance your car, you should ask them to beat the rate you have from wherever else you have looked.

Remember that everything is negotiable. Just because the car finance rate you got is pretty good, it doesn’t mean that you have to pay what they ask. Negotiate the rate of your loan, the price of the car, or anything else you can talk to them about. It can’t hurt and you could save yourself a lot of money that way. As the process goes on, don’t get caught up in the numbers. The dealers will try to give you monthly payment numbers only so that you don’t notice any added charges. However, sit down with a calculator and just figure out the payments yourself and you will have nothing to worry about.

Always know that car financing may seem complicated, but it doesn’t have to be. Educate yourself, shop around, and make sure you know what is going on and you should have no problem. Better yet, you will find yourself with a great new or pre-owned automobile.
