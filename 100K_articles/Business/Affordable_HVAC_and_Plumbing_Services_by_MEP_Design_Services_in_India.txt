A modern home or office building is properly and economically heated, ventilated and air-conditioned. It is able to create its own climate for the comfort of its inhabitants. This kind of convenience and brilliance in design is brought about by the systematic conceptualization and implementation of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) sevice principles. Modern architecture has makes use of convenient and practical principles, applications, and designs. It creates intelligent homes, buildings and infrastructure - meaning light and energy are conserved through carefully planned and wired furniture, electronics and equipment.
