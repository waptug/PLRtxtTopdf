Our Chinese menu that we pilfered from lunch today says that you are bright, patient and inspiring to others. You can be happy by yourself, yet make an outstanding parent. You should marry a Snake or Cock. Avoid those Sheep.

The Ox is a steadfast and solid, a born leader. It’s dependable and has what it takes to achieve great things. They are methodical, not plunging in without considering what the right steps are to get a project finished. They believe in doing it right the first time. 

In the business world, because the Ox can be strong leader, it can also be a bit stubborn or dogmatic. They prefer to lead and don’t like to be pushed around. 

While the Ox is smart, trustworthy caring and honorable, it can also be a bit judgmental and this characteristic can keep them from having the close friends and relationships that they desire. Some good advice for the Ox is to learn to value qualities in others, and to listen to what others have to say. Sometimes it pays just to say nothing. 

The Ox’s daily horoscope for today: Relatives or friends may provide you with discreet and effective help. Try to spend more time with your children and satisfy their needs. Don't forget to play the lottery today -- you'll be then in a stream of chance. All chances will be on your side and at the highest point; it's essential that you forge ahead courageously and methodically. The stars will support your ambitions and will help you be recognized and appreciated in your work.
