How to Operate an All Terrain Vehicle - Driving

• Get acquainted with all terrain vehicles first. Learn as many things as possible about these fascinating, tough machines. Surf the net, read the manuals and slough through magazines about them. Be sure to get to know and ask people who have actually used an ATV.

• Get use to the feel of driving first. First, observe how ATV drivers navigate the rough terrain. Ask them questions if you want. Try seating in one and imagine how you would control it when it is in motion. Do not try to go to really rugged terrain at once. Try the gentler, more manageable terrains in the beginning. Also, do not get on a three-wheel ATV at once. The four-wheel models are more stable and best for beginners. Learn to crawl before you walk.

• Get professional instruction. An all terrain driving instructor can help you learn and master driving an all terrain vehicle. There are also lectures about ATVs which you can attend. You can get reliable recommendations from ATV magazines.

All Terrain Vehicle Driving - Things to Consider

• Your first consideration if you want to drive an all terrain vehicle would be safety. Make sure that you are properly protected from any bump or spill that will most likely occur. Helmets, sturdy shoes, jackets and eye protection should be worn when you are driving an ATV. Injuries and deaths are not uncommon among ATV users.

• Second, you must be skilled and strong enough to control this powerful machine. Never underestimate it. They come with no suspension, except that offered by the tires. They also weigh up to 600 pounds so they are quite difficult to control. You are most likely to be tossed and bumped in all directions and strength to withstand this, and to control the wheel, are absolutely necessary.

• Third, never jeopardize the life of other people by attempting to drive an all terrain vehicle under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Moreover, never let a passenger ride with you especially if you are not that experienced. Most of these vehicles are designed to take on just one person – the driver. If you have to, check with the manufacturer if a passenger is allowed.

ATVs are for the adventurous, rugged type of people who love the challenge of controlling and mastering a powerful machine. It is not for the timid or the weak. But bravery without any ounce of precaution is still quite dangerous. You can enjoy all terrain vehicles but be wise enough to acquire the necessary skill before driving them.
