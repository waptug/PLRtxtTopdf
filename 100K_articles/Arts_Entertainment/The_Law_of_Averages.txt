At First I Didn't Believe It 

I heard about the law of averages only a few weeks after I started Internet Marketing.

I was told that after I had used a certain marketing method for a few weeks, I would notice a trend. For instance, if I was making phone calls, I would notice that for every 40 people I called, 5 would ask for more info, and for every 10 who asked for more info, 1 would join. Or, for every 100 people who visited my webpage, one would take action that resulted in my making a profit.

My personal statistics would differ, they said, depending on the quality of my page, the attractiveness of my offer, my skill in talking on the phone etc. I would have to keep track of my efforts and responses to know how much I would need to work to get the results I wanted.

This is what they told me, but I didn't believe them. I was told that for my webpage, 400 visits a day would make me a solid profit. Well then, I thought, if I get 50 visits a day, I should make a profit after 8 days. Day after day went by without any profits. Week after week, I struggled, checked my stats, and hung my head in dissapointment. I added up my visits for the month. Several thousand visits, and not one sale, or maybe two or three at best.

I remade my web page. Not once, but three times. No difference. The only way you can fail is by giving up. Keep trying. I was told.

Then I Saw It Working

After several months (it seemed like forever) I started noticing a few profit days each month. First I had three days of profit, then five, then eight. Of course when I added things up at the end of the month, I was still losing money. I felt helpless. What was causing the profit, and why was it so sporadic? Was I at the mercy of chance? And if so, why was I so unlucky?

Silly me, I never thought about looking at my webpage visits in relation to my sales. Sure enough, my magic number seemed to be 110. If I had 95 visits to my page in one day, I would lose money almost every time. If I had 100, I may lose money, and I may break even. It was a toss-up. If 110 people visited my site,
Wah-Lah! I was in profit mode! 

This One Concept Could Ensure Your Success 

Now I know this doesn't seem logical, but it really does work. If you will simply believe this principle, you will be on the fast track to success. Here it is again.

The Law of Averages: When you start marketing, you will notice a trend. You will achieve your desired result after a certain number of attempts. That number will tend to continue. All you have to do to achieve your desired result is multiply the number of attempts by this magic number. 
Of course, you will get better at what you do. Your phone skills will improve. You will tweak your page or ad copy, and begin to get better results. Things will get easier as you progress.

But if you believe this principle, your success will be inevitible, and even though it may take time, you will achieve your desired result. It will only take you four clear easily recognizable steps. I won't decieve you and say these steps will be easy, but you will know exactly what your targets are for each step. 

Set up your business. Choose your company or product, and decide what avenues you are going to market it in. Are you going to get a list of leads and call them? Are you going to make a web page? Does the company provide a web page for you to promote online?

Plan your marketing strategy and get started.

Keep track of your statistics. How much exposure do you need to make one sale, or get one sign-up?

Decide how much you want to achieve, multiply by your required exposure, and work to obtain that much exposure. You will know exactly how much you have to work to achieve your goals!
That's all there is to it.

May you be successful beyond your wildest dreams!
