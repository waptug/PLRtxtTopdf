BBQ After Dark

This is one of the greatest BBQ ideas, whether you're entertaining a crowd, or it's just you and your sweetheart. Start by getting your food items together earlier in the day.

Have everything ready to go on the grill by sunset. Hook up a bright light close to the grill so that you're able to cook the food without giving your guests Salmonella or something like that. Then, you want to set up the actual eating area in the yard, away from the lights.

Get a great fire pit, and place chairs around it. You can find these anywhere, or you can learn how to make them on your own.

Light a whole bunch of citronella candles so that no buzzing blood suckers will pester you and your guests. You can add some Tiki torches as well.

Place some twinkling lights in the bushes nearby, or make a walkway from the grill to the seating area with tea light candles placed in white paper bags. This is truly a breathtaking sight.

For a few added details, you can place a bucket next to the fire pit with some pre-selected long sticks and a couple of bags of marshmallows.

This way your guests can roast marshmallows while you shoot the breeze and watch for lightning bugs. No amount of boring BBQ ideas can top the feeling of being under the stars, and enjoying great food, cold drinks, and the company of your family or friends.
