1.  Find Your Niche
Chances are, you already have a target audience that you are marketing your products to.  Let's face it, you're probably looking for ways to increase your market audience and profit...or you probably wouldn't be reading this article.  Here's the real facts... you don't have to find a wider audience to increase you sales.

Have you noticed similar characteristics that groups within your target audience have in common?  Maybe you have a group of businessmen, a group of young mothers, and a group of retirees that frequently make purchases.  That is just the set-up I'm talking about.

Pay attention to the individual characteristics of each group, and divide your advertising into similar segments, or niches.  Focus on the specific needs of the group in the advertising products you put out.  General advertisements are not as effective as more specific ads.  Hey, we all sit up and pay attention to someone who recognizes our specific needs and desires!

2.  Create A Unique Selling Point
Why should someone buy from you and not your competitor?  I hate to deal a blow to your ego, but it really has nothing to do with you , your product, or your service.  Yeah, its a little self-centered, but customers are attracted by offers that point out the things that benefit THEM.

If you want to stand out from the crowd, create a unique selling proposition that stresses the benefits the customers will receive from doing business with you.  Will they get faster service?  Go ahead and dramatize it, but keep the customer at the focus..."Get free overnight delivery!"  Hey, it tells the customer...you get quick service and a discount on shipping.   Two definite benefits in one statement.

Don't go out on a limb to create new products and services to get attention.  Just, add a special benefit to the ones you already have... maybe it's quicker service.  The most effective things to emphasize are benefits that your competition cannot or is not willing to give.  

3.  Offer Your Way To Greater Profits
How many times have you began manhunting?  Sure, as a marketer you scrounge and search for brand new or ancient methods of drawing brand new faces to your place of business.  The fact of the matter is that you don't have to find new customers for your sales to grow.

No, in fact you can take the current business you have and send your profits to the moon with one easy technique... make an offer.  

Greet every sale with an offer of an item that is related to the purchase.  The offered product doesn't even have to be yours.  The Internet is wonderful for affiliate marketers who can make great profits selling the material of others.  

Making your business grow doesn't have to be a stressful, backbreaking or frantic process.  Simply implement these three strategies, and watch it boom!
