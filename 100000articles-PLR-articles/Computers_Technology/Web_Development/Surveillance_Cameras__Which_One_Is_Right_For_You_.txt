Surveillance cameras are everywhere. From homes and offices to banks and government buildings, these powerful little pieces of electronics swerve left and right and monitor everything and everyone. 

In the old days, only big and successful firms can afford them. These days, however, digital multiplexing and the Internet have so democratized access to surveillance systems that just about anyone can purchase and install surveillance cameras. The question is, thus, no longer, "Can you own a surveillance system?" but "What kind of surveillance system is right for you?".

So, how do you know which surveillance camera is right for you?

There are many types of surveillance cameras in the market today. In fact, sleeker and more powerful versions are introduced to the market almost every month. Knowledge of the different types, as well as the differences of each one, will make it easier for you to take your pick from the many types and models in the market. 

Fake surveillance cameras 

Technically, these are not surveillance cameras. They are only inexpensive models that look like one. They are very cheap alternatives to an actual system. The advantage of this type of surveillance camera is its price. The drawback is that this is simply a deterrent and should crime actually take place inside your home or office, for example, you will not have any record of it. 

Wired surveillance cameras

These are best for you if you have only one location to constantly monitor. Most surveillance cameras are easy to install, and you can do the installation yourself. There are, however, other models that require professional help. 

Wireless surveillance cameras

These are more flexible than wired surveillance cameras. They are easy to move around. Moreover, they are very small and do not have a trail of wires giving their location away. They are also easy to install. You would not have problems setting them up based on instructions from manuals. 

Covert surveillance cameras

These surveillance cameras are decor-friendly because they look like regular items. You could easily record goings-on without arousing anyone's suspicions. Covert surveillance cameras may come in the guise of a teddy bear in a child's room, a potted plant by the window sill, or a clock in a small store.

Home surveillance cameras

These are the surveillance systems homeowners frequently purchase. When you buy a setup for your home, you will almost always get a system that includes such bonuses as motion sensors for your wireless camera and timers for your lamps. Like most surveillance cameras, these are easy to install and are very user-friendly.

Night vision surveillance cameras

If you want to monitor an area that is dim not only at night but even during the day as well, then night vision surveillance cameras are for you. These record in black and white in order to capture the clearest images possible. 

Surveillance cameras are extremely useful in protecting your home or office. They will allay your fears of the unknown, reconstruct events should something terrible happen, and help you decide which course of action to take in times of misfortune. They should be chosen with care. It is possible that your choice of surveillance cameras might one day help save your life.
