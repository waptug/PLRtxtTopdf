What Varieties of Collectible Fairy Dolls can you get today?

Once upon a time, when you said dolls, it implied cloth or plastic dolls. Today you have dolls made of porcelain, pliable plastic, stuffed nylon, glass, wood and what not. The variety of the materials available makes the collection of dolls a wonderful hobby. This is why people who gather collectible fairys are indeed lucky for they can work up a very interesting collection with little effort.

1. Porcelain collectible fairys – this is the most common material used for making this type of doll. These dolls are very beautiful, elegant - and expensive as well. For the best deals, you should do your homework on the internet. Besides online shops, you can also seek out individuals who want to exchange or sell collectible fairy dolls from their collection. In this way, you may be able to get hold of some very rare pieces.

2. Plastic dolls are available too; with the help of the present technology, the plastic dolls are actually making a better statement and impact than the original porcelain dolls. As plastic is unbreakable, and the beauty of the doll is as good as its porcelain counterparts, it makes sense to collect this type as well. Since plastic is easily moldable, the dolls made of plastic are more versatile than the porcelain ones.

There are there other materials from which collectible fairys are made such as glass, crystal, silver and even gold – but the most common are the porcelain and the plastic ones. A good collection will consist of all types of dolls made from varying materials, though many people prefer to pursue the collection of only one type of material.

Some people prefer to collect dolls from a particular era or style such as bridal dolls or ethnic dolls. Others focus on size, such as miniature pieces. Whatever the choice of material chosen, such a collection will be a treat to the eyes for any girl or woman who loves or has loved dolls.
