The distributor could be a single person that sells the vending machines out of his/her basement or it could be a large company with salespeople and a catalog that you can browse through. The vending machine distributor works with the vending machine manufacturers to bring you the machines you want to use in your business. 

When you want to start a vending machine business of your own, the first thing you need to do is find a vending machine distributor that has the type of vending machines you want to start with.

This is where a vending machine distributor can really help you. These people know the manufacturers of all the different types of machines and may be able to put you in contact with someone that has used vending machines for sale that are in excellent condition. Since the distributor is usually a good client of the manufacturer buying many machines, for you and others taking advantage of a vending machine business opportunity, he/she will also be able to get a better deal on a new machine.

The Internet is your best source of finding a vending machine distributor.

You also have to consider the location of the distributor in relation to where you are so that the costs of shipping the machines and the supplies will not be too expensive.

Just looking at the website of the vending machine distributor will give you a pretty good idea of whether or not this person is right for you to deal with.
