Pepper in fruit salsa? If you think it sounds odd, just try this colorful salsa. Blended with blueberries and other fruit, dashes of red and black pepper add just enough heat to kindle a delicious combination.

Serve this lively flavored sauce with ice cream and pound cake, as shown here. Or try it as a side with smoked ham, grilled pork chops or chicken. 

Fresh blueberries are available year round and are most abundant in midsummer-ready to blend into smoothies, toss into your favorite chicken salad, or sprinkle over lemon meringue or cream pie. You should know that blueberries are loaded with antioxidants. Studies show that antioxidants may help reduce the buildup of cholesterol that contributes to cardiovascular disease, stroke and other age-related diseases.
