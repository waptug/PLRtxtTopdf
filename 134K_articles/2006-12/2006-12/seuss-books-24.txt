Seuss Books

I love to read, and I hope to pass that love on to my little girl. So far, she has seemed to enjoy all of the time we have spent reading, and it seems to be sticking. She has a huge variety of Dr. Seuss books, and these seem to be her favorites. I can understand that, as I have a good time reading them to her. They are full of amazing creatures and a little lesson about life is hidden in there as well. Not only that, they are great for learning words and speech rhythms.

She has at least six Seuss books that we read all the time, and I have to go out and see if I can find any more. Though I love them, I am getting tired of reading the same ones over and over again. I have friends that seem to have a lot of recommendations, which leads me to believe that even though Seuss books were written for kids, they most definitely appeal to people of all ages. Of course, it may just mean that all of my friends are just kids in grown up suits, but that is quite all right.

If you want to find Seuss books for your own kids, you can find them almost anywhere. You may want to start with the Cat In The Hat, though really, any book will do. You can get them through book clubs for children as well, and you can get them for a great rate this way. They will send you many books each month, and you can pay the bill on a monthly basis if you so choose. This is how we got many of the Seuss books that we have now, and it is probably how I will end up getting more for her.

The best part about Seuss books is that it might be a long time until she outgrows them. Many of the books we have had for a while are no longer any fun for her, but the Seuss books continue to be ones that she asks for each night when it is time for her bedtime story. I don’t want to read them to her every night, but I think they are a great idea for at least a few times a week. They are not only entertaining, but also enriching. I hope she never outgrows them.
