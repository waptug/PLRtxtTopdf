<p>Cleaning concrete is tough and there is an easy way and a hard way. There is one thing you need to understand when you are pressure washer cleaning concrete; the concrete cannot always be made to look brand new again after it has been stained.  You can always get stains lighter or bleached but completely removing it is very difficult, sometimes you get lucky, but if you are looking for perfection, chances are you will be underwhelmed. So when talking to customers let them know up front and explain this to them otherwise they will be asking for a job that just can't be done unless the entire concrete slab is ripped up and re-poured.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about equipment that is needed for this type of work.  Remember safety is always important when working with a pressure washer.  Some times there are chemicals involved in cleaning some stains.  Thus, you should always use some type of eye protection.  Also, when you are using chemicals you need to wear jeans to protect your legs.  Chemicals made for concrete are very strong and should not be toyed with.  Would a person rather work with dry feet or wet?  It is recommended that you get rubber waders or some type of rubber boot.  They will keep your feet from getting wet and keep them from getting burned by the 250 degree water.</p>

<p>Orange cones are also important to have for this job.  These help make people visually aware that you are there if you are in a high traffic area or where there are a lot of contract workers at say a newly constructed house that needs the concrete cleaned.  This makes everyone around you safe and you are helping prevent accidents.  Of course you are going to need a Hydro-Twister for this job.  You can technically do the job with a wand but it will take a lot more time and water, not to mention you can cause streaking if you are not using even strokes across the slab of concrete.  Most of the new hot water pressure washers have an option of a hydro twister type unit but if you don't have one and or you need a second unit we recommend that you go to buy one. When buying a hydro twister buy the larger of the two.  There my be only a 5 inch difference in surface coverage but it is well worth it when you are trying to save time without cutting corners. Especially if you are cleaning concrete at a construction site or a large retail type box store, there is a lot of concrete and the faster you clean it the more money you will make. Think about it.</p>
