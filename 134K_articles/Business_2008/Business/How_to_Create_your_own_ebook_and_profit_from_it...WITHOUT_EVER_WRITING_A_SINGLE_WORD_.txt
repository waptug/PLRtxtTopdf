Many people are making serious money online through eBooks. However, many who have tried to do so as well have failed because writing a quality ebook is very hard to do. The good news is, you can now have your own ebook, sell it, and make great profit without having to write a single word yourself! I assure you will make profits in a week! It has worked for me, and it has worked for many other people as well! Here are some tips that will help you get started:
1.	First, find a niche. 
Finding a niche is the hardest thing you’ll have to do, and it’s not difficult at all! To find a great topic to write about, spend some time on Google. Search for things like “major concerns of Americans” (or the country where your target audience is located), or “Popular topics”. Also try checking out Amazon’s best-selling books, and get some ideas. Your niche can be about anything you want: from chicken soup recipes, to bike riding in Ontario… just make sure there is an audience ready to spend money on that information. 
2.	Find a ghost writer.
This is the special part. It’s hard to write a quality ebook, so why not have someone else write it for you? First thing to do before you start looking is a budget. Once you have one, it’s time to find your freelancer. The best place to get a freelancer to do the job for you is at Elance. There you can look for writers available for hire, or post an offer and wait for someone to accept it. Other places to search for writers include forums like v7n and Digitalpoint. 



3.	Sell your ebook. 
After you had your book written, it’s time to sell it and make a profit! Start by getting a domain name and a webhost, and setting up your landing page. Remember to make it catchy! When you’re done, try marketing your ebook though paid advertisements, forums, etc. and wait for your first sales. If you do it correctly, you should start gaining profit in a week!
