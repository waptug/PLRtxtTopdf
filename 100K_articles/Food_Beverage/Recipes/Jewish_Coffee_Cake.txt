Now here is a coffee cake that will make you want no other coffee cake, and once you prepare this coffee cake and get a real working idea about this cake you can become very creative and use some different jams, jellies, fruits and so on.
Always remember that there is a lot that you can do with a recipe providing you don’t exceed the parameters of the original recipe.
All ingredients should be at room temperature.


¼ pound butter
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
8 ounces sour cream
2 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder


Cream the butter and sugar together then add eggs one at a time and mix the rest of the ingredients together slowly.
In a separate bowl combine 1 cup brown sugar, ½ cup diced walnuts and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon or as much as you like and mix them together.
Using a 10 inch x 3inch tube pan, make sure that the pan is well greased and floured, place some cake mix in the bottom and then some of the sugar, walnut and cinnamon mixture and then repeat this procedure until you have all the cake mix in the pan and the top layer is the cinnamon mixture.

Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes or until a pick placed in the center of the cake comes out clean, cool and enjoy, I like mine warm with some raspberry jam on it.
