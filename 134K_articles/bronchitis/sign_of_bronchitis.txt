Each person is looking for a sign that may have a significant meaning to his life. When he wants something and is not sure whether he will pursue it or not, he would usually stop and ask for a certain sign. Even when the Lord Jesus was born, the sign was a star that led the magi to his manger. Different signs for different events or happenings take place everyday.

What if you have a disease or illness? Will you still be asking for a sign? Naturally, a person will exhibit some sort of signs or symptoms associated with the disease. There are many diseases known all over the world; and each disease or illness has their own signs and symptoms.

Bronchitis is a common respiratory disease that affects millions of people in the entire world. Though oftentimes it can be misdiagnosed, medical practitioners are trying their best efforts to give an accurate diagnosis based on the signs shown by their patients. There are two types of bronchitis, acute and chronic bronchitis.

Acute bronchitis is a mild or moderate form of bronchitis while chronic bronchitis is a severe condition that needs appropriate medication and treatment. Each type of bronchitis can be easily determined by physicians or doctors because of the different signs and symptoms exhibited by the patient.

Acute Bronchitis Signs

-	similar to that of cold symptoms
-	wheezing
-	painful cough
-	chest and throat pain
-	fever
-	coughs up pus
-	generally unwell

Chronic Bronchitis Signs

-	productive and persistent cough
-	excessive mucus secretion in airways
-	mild fever and chest pain
-	breathlessness
-	has acute bronchitis episodes
-	winter cough that disappears in summer

Bronchitis shows signs similar to other upper infections of the respiratory tract which includes soreness, burning feeling or constriction in the chest, congestion, sore throat, wheezing, breathlessness, overall malaise, chills and with slight fever. This is why bronchitis may be misdiagnosed for other respiratory infections like chronic sinusitis because the signs felt by the individual are very similar. Chronic sinusitis is an infection in your nose' bone, and one of its signs include a green or yellow, thick postnasal discharge coupled with unceasing cough. This is usually triggered when an individual tries to clear mucus from his or her throat.

Signs of bronchitis are impossible to detect, especially that of acute bronchitis as the respiratory system has constricted contractions. If acute bronchitis remains untreated, in time complications may occur that can bring about chronicisation and asthmatic bronchitis. Adults, children, and newborns suffering from emphysema are at a great risk.

A premature treatment or diagnosis can manipulate negatively the establishment of signs and symptoms. If you want to improve the signs of bronchitis, you must do physical exercises like aerobic exercise. This is helpful in sustaining breathing after you're cured of bronchitis. Bronchitis patients need to do a lot of normal walking exercises. There are also cardio exercises that you can perform to ameliorate breathing, fortify muscles, and calm the bronchitis patient.

When you already have bronchitis, whether acute or chronic, you should refrain from eating dairy products because these things increase mucus secretion and can aggravate the infection. By eating dairy products, the bacteria multiply quickly.

If you want to further improve the bronchitis signs that you feel, you can use pepper, garlic, and stock (from chicken) especially if you have acute bronchitis. This aids in the dilution of mucus, as well as its elimination. You can also put yourself under eucalyptus therapy to calm the irritation in your lungs and bronchial tubes to improve respiration. Apply warm compresses and take warm baths to clear mucus and help in stabilizing the breathing process. And if you're a smoker, you'd better quit as soon as possible and take the necessary precautions. Also try to avoid second-hand smoke because it's even more harmful.

Signs and symptoms of diseases serve as a warning to patients having the illness. Once you do experience some of the signs, then you can immediately seek the help of a physician or doctor. This way, you can prevent complications and be able to treat the disease at an early stage. Look for a reputable and experienced doctor to get the proper diagnosis.
