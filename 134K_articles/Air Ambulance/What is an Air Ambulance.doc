}What is an Air Ambulance?\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 An air ambulance
 is an aircraft specifically used for the treatment of a patient who has been seriously
 injured or is critically ill.  An air ambulance is primarily used in emergency 
situations where transport of the patient by standard land ambulance would not be
 timely or safe.  Another instance where an air ambulance may be used is when a 
patient must be transported from one location to another and standard, conventional
 air travel is not feasible.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 An air ambulance
 is looked at as an operating room in the air, or a flying critical care unit.  
Each air ambulance is specially staffed with an experienced flight crew that is 
highly trained to fly medical missions.  On board the air ambulance aircraft you
 will find trained pilots and flight crew, as well as, medical staff that can safely
 care for critically ill or injured patients.  The medical staff may be a nurse 
trained and experienced in CCU care, a qualified doctor capable of treating severe
 trauma injuries, or a specialized team of doctors and nurses that meet the specific
 needs of the patient.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Each air 
ambulance carries with it specialized medical tools and equipment that can handle
 nearly any emergency that may arise.  Some examples of standard equipment found
 on an air ambulance includes ventilators, ECG equipment, CPR equipment, stretcher
, medication, and other important tools that enable the crew to care for the patient
.    \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The medical
 equipment is properly cleaned and tested before each and every flight.  The standards
 patients expect from their doctor, ER or ICU are carried out inside and onboard
 the air ambulance.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The plane
 may vary dramatically depending on its designated mission.  Some air ambulances
 are helicopters.  Such aircraft are typically used to transport patients from the
 scene of an accident to a local hospital in the nearest big city that is equipped
 to handle the injuries.  Choppers are air ambulances that can be used to retrieve
 patients from remote areas where conventional ambulances are unable to reach.  
\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 In other 
instances, small prop planes or jets are the preferred aircraft for longer trips
.  Jets are the best aircraft for trips over distances of 500 miles, because such
 planes allow for less fuel stops and speedier travel times.  Like an ambulance 
on the ground, the goal of an air ambulance is to get the patient to the destination
 as safely and speedily as possible.  Jets are capable of flying at higher altitudes
 which allow for the greatest comfort and speed.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Patients 
who may need the use of an air ambulance require constant\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Medical monitoring
.  Some patients may include cardiac patients, respiratory patients, NICU situations
, patients with multiple IV drips, or critical trauma patients.  Any patient with
 any illness or injury that the doctor deems unsafe to fly by conventional means
 will be able to get a doctor\u8217\'92s permission to fly in an air ambulance to
 the desired destination unless very specific medical reasons exist to avoid such
 methods of transportation.  Frequently, travel by air ambulance is deemed safe 
and can truly save lives.\par}
