Asset Label Types
We have split asset labels into different categories and will explain their strengths and suitability and their applications.
 
1) Permanent frangible vinyl asset labels
2) Silver Voiding asset labels

1) Permanent Frangible Vinyl Asset Label
This label is suitable for most applications. These labels are much higher quality asset labels than the paper version and are more common in the field. The label material will conform to the majority of surfaces and forms a high-strength bond. This material has excellent initial grab and quite often (after initial application) will provide a good adhesion to many surfaces (when clean). The maximum strength of this label is attained within a 4 hour + period where the glue on the label hardens and makes the label impossible to remove in one piece
 
This is good for marking workstations, casings, monitors and smaller items. The grain on the computer plastics can be tricky to adhere to with certain asset labels, but the vinyl labels are very effective for this application. The material is also suited to varnished and smooth surfaces. These labels can be personalized with Code 39 barcodes, serial numbers and often with the logo printed too. Some companies offer further protection with a hologram label included to prevent counterfeiting. The vinyl labels are usually supplied on reels and most companies offer a turnaround within 33 to 5 days however some companies offer 24hr / next day service. 

These are great for Hospitals, Schools, IT Department & Offices as when the adhesive sets it becomes very strong prevents people or children removing the labels in one piece.
This vinyl asset label material is suitable in many different applications such as:-

PC & IT Equipment, Monitors and LCD displays, Laptop Computers, Keyboards, Mice, Mobile Equipment including PDA's, Networking Equipment, Fileservers, Hard Drives, Printed Circuit Boards, Painted Metal Surfaces, Wood, Plastics, Glass, Metals, Paper Surfaces, etc.

2) Silver Voiding Asset Label
This substrate is used primarily in situations where tampering needs to be revealed. The construction of the material utilises a two stage adhesive. The label will grab very well and on any attempt of removal, will leave the words VOID on the label and on the material it is stuck to. Even if you try to replace the label by sticking it down in the same position it is still apparent that tampering has taken effect. 

This material is used in many different applications such as:-

Covering Memory & Expansion covers on IT Equipment, Sealing Paper, Card & Plastic surfaces, Calibration Seals, Sealing Postage Bags, Medicine Boxes and Cartons, Electronic Enclosure Boxes, HiFi & Stereo Units, Computer Cases, Mobile Telephones, PDA's, Sealing Doors, NHS & Medical Equipment, Oscilloscopes, etc.
