Article Body:
Rust is a term which is generally used for a chemical compound iron oxide (Fe2O3). It is formed when iron combines with oxygen or water. Rust poses a significant problem it has been with us since the very dawn of the Iron Age. It not only affects cars, metal furniture and other durable metal objects but also upsets many business setups. It is bad for the people who have shops in cellars. Cellars tend to dampen and the dampness leads to rust or mold. Rust decreases the life of an object and hence, it becomes importantly necessary to remove or prevent rust from occurring.

There are several measures available to control corrosion and prevent the formation of rust. This is called rust proofing. Cathode protection is one such method. It uses electro chemical techniques. Galvanizing is used most frequently these days. It consists of a metal, to be coated, with a thin layer of another metal, generally zinc. Zinc provides cathode protection to the underlying metal as it is more negative than iron. Another technique used to prevent rust is bluing. It provides resistance to rusting for small steel items, fire arms etc. In this the water displacing oil is rubbed onto the blued steel.

Rust decreases the life of any object. Thus, it is very important to take proactive prevention measures in order to inhibit the formation of rust on an object. There are various ways of accomplishing this. The commonest of them is to cover or paint the object with a material that prevents or does not support rust and acts as a rust remover. For an example, the objects are covered with craft and hobby enamels. It has a smooth and satin finish. The ingredients penetrate faster and last longer. It is usually used on wood, metal, wicker and crafts. It also has an excellent chip resistance and is durable. The antique copper and antique gold are also used to give a rich and beautiful look to the objects besides preventing corrosion.

The other methods include the tough and durable epoxy coating of an appliance. It is used for appliances, cabinets and other home use appliances. It consists of ultra hard enamel. It also provides a superior abrasion and scratch resistance. It is washable and gives the user a moisture resistant surface. Lacquer is generally used on furniture and other accessories in order to prevent them from rusting. It gives an ultra rich finish to the objects. It has a smooth and fast dry formula which gives better results.

The most common way to prevent objects from rusting is with the use of rust paints. They can be used indoors or outdoors and have a fast dry formula. Besides, preventing rust, it gives a smooth and durable glass finish to the objects. It penetrates the surface more and lasts much longer than ordinary paints. It is weather resistant and gives easy soap and water clean up. It also has excellent adhesion and superior coverage over other ordinary paints. These rust paints are developed especially to prevent corrosion by resisting moisture. They are used on furniture, outdoor fixtures, railings, mail boxes, doors, windows, bicycles among others.
