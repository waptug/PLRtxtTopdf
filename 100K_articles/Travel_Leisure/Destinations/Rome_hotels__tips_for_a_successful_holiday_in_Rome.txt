Rome is a city that can accommodate also the travelers who want to save money without sacrificing comfort, convenience, and well being in the bargain.

Since the beginning of the XX century many hotels located near the spanish steps and trevi fountain are still family owned. The warm hotel management of these buildings made these roman families proud to serve their guests for many years.

It's not rare to find in some of these accommodations magnificent Belle Epoque lobbies and sitting rooms, with wood burning fireplaces and a bar to one side.
The rooms of the hotels located in Rome city center vary in size and are nicely appointed with antiques, coordinated fabriques, cable television and also internet connection. Several have balconies: in fact even the smallest single room has enough space to unpack and stay in comfort. The bathrooms have been revamped in marble and offer soft towels, a telephone, and a selection of toiletries.

A summer roof garden adds to the hotels in Rome an unbelievable charm. It's always recommended to book your hotels in Rome in the so called " centro storico" ( historical city center ) because good restaurants and shopping opportunities are all within easy walking distance.

What makes Rome a very complete city is that its hotels combine central locations with a warm, personalized athmosphere and friendly staff: space is never an issue in the rooms, which beautifully integrate their elegant past with the comforts of today.
