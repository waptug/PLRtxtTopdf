It is not uncommon for people who are beneficiaries of a structured settlement to sell some or all of the settlements for a cash payout. The reasons for selling a structured settlement vary but the process for obtaining cash for a structured settlement is the more or less the same across all states in America. 

There are many settlement-purchasing companies that offer a number of plans for buying a structured settlement and offer an instant cash payout. The plans offered by these companies are useful for obtaining a lump sum for repaying debts, financing college education, or availing a business opportunity. Since there are many financial companies that purchase settlements, it is in the best interests of the seller to seek advice from his attorney and financial advisor before deciding to do business with a particular structured settlement company. 

An online research should yield details on a number of structured settlement companies that one can visit online. The key factors that decide the choice of a structured settlement buyer include the rate of interest charged, the buyer’s financial standing, buyer’s reputation for fair-dealing, and his relationship with the insurance companies or the actual payers of the structured settlement installments. Since the cash payout is less than the value of the settlement sold, one should actively seek out a buyer that offers maximum cash payout for the settlements sold. Costs incurred in the sale of a structured settlement also include service fees, closing fees, broker fees, and legal expenses.

The responsibility of getting the best out of the sale of structured settlement lies with the seller. This means he has to be aware of the minimum waiting period, if any, that the state may impose on the sale of a structured settlement as well as other state and federal regulations that govern the sale of a structured settlement.

A written court order approving the sale of structured settlements is necessary for the seller to receive the cash payout. Court approval is subject to the seller being able to prove that the sale is the best means available to him for achieving liquidity. Brokers who are knowledgeable about the court procedures involved in the sale of structured settlements can offer useful help to the seller and his financial advisor. The entire process of obtaining a cash payout can take up to sixty days and includes submitting an application to the settlement buyer, signing of the closing documents by the two parties, and the legal formalities.
