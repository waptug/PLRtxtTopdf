With literally thousands of how-to books circling the web, and bookstores, explaining that they have the "secret" to increased traffic; it is very difficult for a webmaster to choose the correct way to gain traffic.  While some of these books actually have great tips and information on gaining visitors to your site, there is one method that has proven itself in the last couple of years as being one of the best ways to attract loyal viewers, and potentially customers.  This is done through the medium of web video, and it is an extremely powerful method to creating a high-profile website that is visited by thousands of individual's everyday.  

Perhaps one of the biggest reasons why so many webmasters are using web video as a means to drive traffic is because it is a great, and free, way to interact with potential visitors, as well as providing them with pivotal information that is fun to watch.  Web video is an amazingly powerful way to show your viewers information, and inform them of your various website and products.  There are several keys that you must follow when making a web video for website promotion.  When you follow these tips, you will be able to have an extremely successful web video campaign, and you will reap the benefits of this.  

The most important key to using web video for website promotion, is to make videos that are interesting, entertaining and above all else, informative.  Individuals will find your videos based on what they are about.  If you are selling a how-to book on fixing home appliances, the best way to reach your audience is to make short videos on how to fix various problems within your home.  An example of this would be to make a web video explaining the steps to fixing a leaky faucet.  This not only will give your viewers a chance to see how informative your information is, but you will also be helping them out as well.

More than likely, when you provide a web video that answers a question, the viewers will come to your site to find other answers to their various questions.  This is a great way to build loyalty with the potential customer, as well as giving them an actual reason to purchase your product.  

After you have compiled several videos on your topic, you will then need to post these videos online in order for them to be seen.  Yet, the biggest question is, where should you post you web videos?  There are literally hundreds of various web video sites that allow you to put your own video on their server.  However, the key is finding the correct site to place your video on.  It's no question that YouTube is the most popular video site on the Internet.

And by placing your video, along with proper keywords, on YouTube you will soon be experiencing a flow of constant traffic to your site.  Although, if you do not want to go through and post your videos on all of the various websites by hand, you can use video submission services to do this for you.  Perhaps the best out of all these systems is Traffic Geyser.  This system will submit your video to all of the major video hosting websites, thus growing your traffic immensely.
