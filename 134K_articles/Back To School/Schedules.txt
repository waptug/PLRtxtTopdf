Schedules

	I just started back to college.  My oldest boy just started morning kindergarten.  My youngest boy started pre-school.  I had another child start junior high, and two others that are in elementary school.  My schedule is insane.  More than insane.  I’m not really sure how I am even managing to keep it all straight.  We are just finishing the first week, and I haven’t forgotten to pick up anyone, and I even went to the right classes myself.
	Having a schedule is a great way to help you stay on task.  We can give our children schedules, and I’ve even heard of husbands that had a schedule, although I believe that is just an urban legend.  
	If you are having difficulty completing what you need to do each day, try writing it out.  Break your day down into the times that you are awake.  Next, include time to get ready in the morning and complete any household chores you normally do.  Make spaces for your meals and other necessities that you do each day.  Then look at how much time I left.  Don’t be scared when you see how little time there is.  The purpose of a schedule is to make the most of the time you have.
	Prioritize the events and tasks that need to be completed first.  Find a way to work your schedule to make the best use of time.  You can try running all your errands at the same time or on the same day.  Group similar tasks together.  Then take your schedule with you and try to follow it.  Adapt where needed.  
	It takes some time to adjust to having a schedule, but assessing your time, prioritizing it, and filling your available time with the tasks you need to complete will help you get done everything you need to do in a day.
