Falling in debt is a very painful process of life, which practically every one falls into at one time or the other. Sometimes, you may not know what to do to get out of debt; it is in such conditions that it is better to approach a debt consolidation company for a debt consolidation loan.

A debt consolidation loan is a loan that replaces multiple smaller loans wherein you make a single payment to the debt consolidation company. This loan is usually for a longer period, and at a lower interest rate. The main advantage of a low interest debt consolidation loan is that instead of having to face numerous creditors every month to make their monthly payments, this job is handled by the debt consolidation company. They will pay the individual companies their payments with the single payment you make to them.

There is huge competition among debt consolidation companies, on who provides the loan at a lower rate.

With this, you can decide which debt consolidation loan is offering a lower interest than the interest rates of the loans you already have.

It is important to place some collateral for a debt consolidation loan, like a home, car, and vehicle. However to get a low interest debt consolidation loan, it is better to offer a property with a higher collateral value. The lender is sure to offer you a lower rate with the high property placed as collateral.

When the amount you borrow is lower than the collateral, the lender faces a lower risk, and will thereby be ready to offer you a low rate debt consolidation loan. Avoid borrowing more money than you need. This only increases your debt, and will bring you a higher interest rate! And try to opt for a short repayment schedule for the debt consolidation loan. Repaying a debt consolidation loan can possibly to take a long time of up to 30 years. However, the longer the period, the higher the interest!

Approaching small finance companies for a debt consolidation is another strategy to employ to get a low interest debt consolidation loan. This is because as they are usually startup companies, they are always on the lookout for new clients, and are ready to quote low interest rates.

Once you decide on the right debt consolidation company offering a low interest debt consolidation loan, counselors will be sent to you to access your financial position. Once they get an idea of all your loans and creditors, they will approach your creditors to negotiate for lower monthly installments and interest rates. The creditors usually oblige to this as they consider a lower payment is better than no payment at all!

Some debt consolidation companies may charge a fee for these services, while some do it for free. Then once the creditors are all approached, and monthly payment set upon, you just have to pay the company and they will pay your creditors on your behalf!
