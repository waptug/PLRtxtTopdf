Cashing Out Equity Can Save You Money

By securing your debt consolidation loan with your home’s equity, you qualify for some of the cheapest financing available to you. So you can trade in your double digit credit card rates for single digit mortgage rates. To get the most out of your cash out refi, decide if you want one or two mortgages. By refinancing your original mortgage, you qualify for lower overall rates. But if you have good rates now, it might be better to take out a second mortgage. Even with higher rates, having separate mortgages could be cheaper for you.

Selecting The Right Refi Terms

Terms are just as important as rates when trying to reduce your debts. Ideally, you want a short term loan to get out of debt sooner. This doesn’t necessarily mean higher payments though. With lower rates, you can select a loan years shorter with the same monthly payment. Adjustable rate home loans also offer low payments, but there is the chance that your rates could increase. Fixed rate loans provide security of knowing what your rates and payments will always be.

Lenders Make The Difference

Not all lendering companies are created the same. Each financing company has their own formula for determining loan rates and closing costs. To make sure you are getting the best refi deal for your credit circumstances, ask for a loan estimate. Within minutes you can receive dozens of offers from several lenders. You can then make side-by-side comparisons to select the best option. This is just another way you can save thousands on your loan’s cost. When you are ready, you can complete your loan application online for speedy approval. In less than two weeks, your loan’s paperwork can be completed, and you can pay off your other bills.
