Benefits Of Debt Consolidation

Not only does debt consolidation reduce paperwork hassles, it also saves you money. With lower rates on your debt, you have the choice of reducing your debt faster or spending the extra money in other needed areas.

Refinancing your debt also gives you the option to select more favorable loan terms. So you may decide to extend your loan period to further reduce your monthly payment. Or you may want to shorten your loan schedule to get out of debt faster. It is up to you.

Number Of Financing Options

Depending on your finances, you have a number of ways to consolidate your debt. For the cheapest loan, use your home equity. With your equity securing your financing, you get approved for some of the lowest rates and can qualify for tax deductions.

If a home equity loan isn’t an option, consider applying for a personal loan. Rates will usually be five to ten points less than credit card rates. There are more limits with a personal loan, such as caps at $25,000 and maximum five year loan periods.

Other option is to transfer credit card debt to a new account. Usually when you open a new credit card, you qualify for especially good deals on balance transfers. In some cases, you don’t have to pay any interest. This can give you a chance to really cut your principal.

Be A Smart Credit Shopper

Make sure you get the best deal on financing by being a smart credit shopper. Look at recommended financing companies and ask about loan quotes. Compare these with other offers before signing any contract.

Debt consolidation helps you make your money go farther and get out of debt sooner. Make it part of your larger financial goals to get on track.
