Most chrome bar stools come with a variety of colour seats they attribute black, raspberry, or some other deep colour to counterbalance the shimmering chrome. This style of bar stool does not typically incorporate seatbacks, but if you are determined enough you can find them easily. Swivel seats for a chrome bar stool are also the standard.
A good point to remember when considering buying a chrome bar stool is they don’t rust. 

For places of industry this is exceptionally useful for when drinks get knocked over or cleaning of the stools need to be carried out, this could facilitate rust on an ordinary stool. The same applies to chrome bar stools found in the home, if the bar stools are in the kitchen say, then the legs could get a good soaking from kids spilling juice and stuff.

Another key advantage to a chrome bar stool is its durability and strength; this is of course a huge advantage for industry as stools get knocked about a lot as well in the home if you have kids.
