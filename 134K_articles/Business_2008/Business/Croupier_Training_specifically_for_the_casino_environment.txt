You can find casinos from the casino company sites and approach them to realize about vacancies. Navigate in the British Casino Association website (in Further Information) for a list of the main casino companies. However, you may be able to progress to management after gaining practice as a dealer or croupier.
To work as a croupier you will need to get a license from the Gambling Commission, the organization that regulates gambling. Gaining a license will engage productively completing a program of training. This will generally be a paid on-the-job preparation course, provided by your employer. Courses last between six and eight weeks and include the skills and techniques you will need as a dealer or croupier, casino legislation and customer service.
Casino companies who do not have their own in-house training will pay for your training with a private training organization. When you have finished your training your tutor will apply for your license.

When you have two/three years practice in a casino and the facility to deal at least three various games, you may be able to apply for a position on a cruise ship, in an overseas casino, or in an online casino featuring live dealers via webcam using real-time video streaming. To work in non-English speaking countries you must have a good familiarity of the correct language. To work in important casinos in Las Vegas or MonteCarlo, you will need extensive and varied experience, and the ability to pass a dealing audition.
