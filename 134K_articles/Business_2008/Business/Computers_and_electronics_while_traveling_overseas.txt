COMPUTING ON THE MOVE
 
 Well i'm off on my holidays,this time abroad,the good ole USA,but i still need to be "on-line" on a daily basis for my personal & business needs, so i have brought some lightweight products ,that don't take much room and are easily transportable
   
1,  THE COMPUTER

Well the first thing is the computer ,shall i take my old compaq armarda M700 ,which has been usefull in the past or shall i invest in a new one , here we go scouting around the shops or should i say online ,there's so many choices from, this notebook to that notebook with this spec' to that spec'geez my holiday will be over before i choose one at this rate .In the finish i have made my choice on size ,purely for travelings sake ,i went for for a Packard Bell XS200-06,seems a pretty good choice to me, it has a built in web cam ,microphone ,ofcourse speakers,bluetooth ,wifi , hey its the business,as long as you have keen eye sight, as the screens a bit small, its ideal for me.only weighs a couple of kilo's, so i thinK i have made a good choice. 

2,  MUSIC
 
Now i'm not into music in a big way just a few songs,so i won't be taking too much in that regards ,cut out the cd's, so i have brought myself a mp3/dab radio .my other portable radio packed up so this one will do two jobs.As i'm driving over 2000 miles i need some entertianment to keep me entertained,and my experiences in the past of radio stations in america have not been good i can record off the net my favourite english station and download onto my new Alba mp3 player,and thro' a simple device can get it playing thro' the car stereo system..im ready to go now .

3, ATTACHMENTS & ACCESSORIES
 
So what do i need in this area,i prefer a handheld mouse rather than the inbuilt touch pad ,i'll be taking my phone so i need my charger,head set perhaps ,external mic so i can keep in touch with "back home" at a discount rate,carry case, Now buying these bits indiviually might cost a few pounds , but wait i have found something cool, the local supermarket is selling computers & accessories this week, lets see what they've got...I'm in luck an accessory pack for £14.99  WOW,what a deal. Now i ain't heard that much about Tevion products but anything else i have brought from there seem good quality, and for that small amount i'm prepared to take a chance ,so what do we have?

    1, USB KEYPAD................not much use ,but i can make the space usefull for something else
    2, USB HUB 4-WAY.............great as the laptop has only 2 usb sockets this might come in handy
    3, USB CABLE.................okay if i need a bit of extension i guess
    4. EARPIECE with MIC.........great,small compact and will definatly come in handy
    5, NETWORK CABLE ............okay this might be usefull at some of the motels i stay at 
    6, USB MINI OPTICAL MOUSE....fantastic will be extreemly usefull
    7, MINI USB ADAPTOR..........saves me taking the mp3 cable ..great
    8, USB PIN ADAPTOR...........may be useful at some point
    9, USB LIGHT.................i've found these out to be useless in the past ,but you never know
