If you are just getting involved with label printing or are considering outsourcing your label printing needs to a professional, you have probably already encountered a few industry-specific terms with which you may not be entirely familiar.  One such term is “artwork.”  Artwork is completely unrelated to your favorite museum pieces and does not necessarily refer to “graphical” elements, either.   Let us look at what artwork for label printing is all about.

In the simplest of terms, artwork refers to the layout of a label’s design.  That includes factors such as the actual words used (referred to as the “copy”) and any images that might be involved in the design, as well.  In essence, the artwork for label printing is the complete “look” of the label, including all of its components.  Artwork is finalized prior to the label printing company’s creation of printing plates or negatives.

Depending upon the label printing company with whom you work, artwork may be your responsibility, their responsibility, or a joint effort.  In all cases, the label printing firm should provide you with samples, or mock-ups, of your labels before turning the artwork into a final product.

Label printing experts often employee design specialists to help with artwork.  In some cases, they will actually create the label’s artwork after a discussion with the client and then submit it to the buyer for approval.  In other situations, a bare-bones label printing team may require you to provide finished artwork.

Understanding the vocabulary of label printing is an important way to make sure you get what you want from the printer.  Artwork, which refers to the collective whole of your future label, is an expression with which you will need to be familiar.
