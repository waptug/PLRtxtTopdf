Different Ways to Play Hide and Seek

The traditional way to play hide and seek never gets old, but you may want a change if it 
is requested every day.  Here are a few ways to play hide and seek with a twist while 
staying in the backyard.

Have the kids pick out some toys that are not too small and are allowed outside.  While 
they cover their eyes and count, you hide the toys around the yard.  You can let them run 
loose and try to find them or play hot and cold if they are having a hard time.  If the kids 
don’t understand the concept of hot and cold you can use different words “you’re getting 
closer” or “you’re getting farther away.”  Or give away little hints they have to figure out.

Sardines is a fun variation on hide and seek.  You will need a few kids to play (at least 
three or four).  The person who is designated as “it” does the hiding instead of the 
counting.  Once the allotted time is up everyone has to try and find the hidden person.  As 
each child finds the person who is hiding, instead of calling out they found them, they 
hide with them.  This continues until all the kids are in one spot.  It can get really squishy 
playing this game – just like in a can of sardines.

Chain hide and seek is also best if at least four children are participating.  As the person 
who is “it” finds the other kids playing, they have to hold hands and form a chain until 
everyone is found.  Falling down and giggling are sure to ensue as the kids try to run 
around while holding hands.  This is a great one to play in the park.  Involve all the kids 
in the park and see how long the chain get get.
