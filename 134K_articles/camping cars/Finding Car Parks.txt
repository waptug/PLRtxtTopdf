Finding Car Parks 

There are parking areas for the camping cars that you use.  They are going to be especially for camping cars and nothing else.  They are going to usually be found in the campgrounds and they will give you enough room to do whatever you need to. 

These grounds are going to give you tent facilities for camping and not all parks will offer these services.
