Car Show Basics

Have you ever wondered what the point of a car show is?  After all, what could possibly be so much fun about accumulating so many cars in a single area?  Most people do not realize, but car shows are about so much more than simply lining up a bunch of beautiful cars for people to admire.  There are typically contests that are involved in the shows as well with awards handed out in several categories including Best Overall, and often Best Restoration and other similar categories.

For those who are bringing cars to the show, it is a chance to show off the handiwork that they have put into the car, and also a chance to see how others feel about their work.  Of course, some people are lucky and walk away from almost every show they enter with a prize, but generally this does not happen.  Most people put months and even years of work into a car before they leave a show with a prize.  

This can translate into thousands of dollars worth of work often.  Dog shows are for dog lovers, and car shows are the equivalent but based around cars.  Because of this the competition can sometimes be quite stiff, but in general terms they are still a ton of fun to watch.  There is hardly ever a time when someone is unable to find something to do at a car show that does not interest them. 

From the dozens to hundreds of cars that are entered there are only a small handful that will leave with a prize or a place as one of the top cars.  The fun of looking around and seeing who wins, combined with seeing the beautiful cars, and also participating in some of the other activities that are going on make it a great way to spend the weekend.  There are many people who spend all of their weekends looking around for a car show to attend.

Not everyone who is dedicated to attending car shows actually have cars.  Some of the people who enjoy car shows the most do not have a car, and may not even have an interested in getting a car that would be able to enter the car show.  Deciding if you are interested in attending the car show is often dependent on your personality but realizing that there is much more to the car show than simply walking the rows and rows of cars is often enough to catch many people’s interest.

While car shows are not always considered a sport, they often help to foster great sportsmanship amongst competitors and can be a great way to share experiences and learn plenty about cars.  If you are interested in getting involved in the car shows then sometimes attending a few shows before you enter can be a great way to learn as much as possible about what the judges are typically looking for so that you can improve your vehicle to improve your overall chances of walking away as a winner.

Just think in a single location there are so many gorgeous cars that are all beautifully restored and you can spend all of the time you want looking and dreaming about each one.  There are so many people to meet as well that you can have a lot of fun and you may discover that car shows are your favorite weekend activity that you never knew about.
