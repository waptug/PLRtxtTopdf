\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 If you have
 considered purchasing an ATV you probably know that it can be an expensive endeavor
. ATV\u8217\'92s range in price and the hobby can become expensive fast. If you 
want the newest model with all the bells and whistles, expect to pay a high price
. However, if you want to get into ATV riding for less, it is possible to buy a 
used ATV for a much lower price and still have just as much fun. You should not 
think that buying a used ATV will compromise safety or quality. If you research 
the ATV before you buy it and know what to look for, you can find a perfectly safe
 and operable ATV for a fraction of the price of a new one. This is great for beginners
 who want to test the waters before they invest in a brand new machine, or for people
 who want to experience the fun of ATV riding but do not want to pay a premium. 
Some people like to tinker with their ATV\u8217\'92s and customize them. Buying 
a used ATV is perfect for this as you can find many used parts to create a one of
 a kind ATV.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 The safest
 bet in used ATV\u8217\'92s are models made within the last few years. It is possible
 to find an older model that is in great condition, but if you are new to ATV\u8217
\'92s or have not done extensive research it is best to stick to models that were
 made fairly recently. Recent models will have less miles and will have the least
 amount of wear overall compared to older models. They also require less maintenance
 than older models. \par}

 know a lot about the inner workings of ATV\u8217\'92s, it is best to buy a used
 ATV from a company or shop that employs mechanics and has experience selling and
 repairing ATV\u8216\'91s. You can find great used ATV\u8217\'92s form private sellers
, but you have to be sure that you know what to look for to determine quality. If
 you do not know much about repairing ATV\u8217\'92s, you are better off purchasing
 from someone who does. Buying a used ATV from a company or shop will also usually
 provide you with some added peace of mind in the form of a limited warranty or 
return policy. If you are going to buy from a private seller, make sure they have
 a good rating if they are an inline seller or they have references if they are 
a local seller. No matter where you buy your used ATV, make sure you do some research
 on prices and know what to expect to pay. You should also know what to look for
 and how to identify an ATV that has been well taken care of as opposed to one that
 has been neglected and will require work.\par}
