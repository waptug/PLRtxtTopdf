How do you define good customer service? Does that simply mean the satisfactory marketing and sale of a product or service to a customer or does it mean something else? Is providing good customer service, good enough? 

In these days of below average customer service, you may think providing good service will set you apart from the pack. Well, I am here to tell you that nothing less than exemplary service will help you succeed.  By incorporating the “wow” factor into every successful sale, you will achieve greater profits and better customer satisfaction.

To achieve the “wow” factor, you must be honest, knowledgeable, friendly, professional and deliver on your promises. Do not over promise, but do not under promise either. 

In addition, you must be able to provide a high level of service to everyone who comes in contact with your business. If you do, you’ll also get more referrals from your satisfied clients.

“Wow” everyone who comes into contact with you and your business.  You want people to be blown away by the extraordinary level of service you deliver to your clients.  Demonstrate your exceptional level of customer service by showing your generosity through gift giving.  Your goal should be to deliver such a high level of service that your clients can’t wait to tell their family members, friends and co-workers about your company.

Everyone who comes into contact with your business is a potential client or referrer.  Reward those who refer people to you by offering them a gift. Send gifts to all business associates in order to gain favor.  This is a great way to build relationships with the people you rely on to do business.  Look for a reason to send these people a thank you card along with a gift.

So, what types of gifts should you send? I’ll leave that up to your imagination, but here are some ideas to help you get started:

Movie passes
Starbucks cards
Flowers, houseplants
A ticket for a free car wash
Gift candles
Favorite recipes
Gourmet chocolates or gourmet popcorn

Successful sales people always make sure their faithful referrers are regularly and consistently rewarded. Set aside the best rewards for your top referrers. This may include:

Dinner for two at a fancy restaurant
Tickets to the opera or to a rock concert
A gift card 
High end fruit or gift basket
Potted plant or flower arrangement
A personally inscribed pen

Yes, when it comes to gift giving the sky is the limit. The more personal the gift, the more likely it will be remembered and it will serve as a thoughtful reminder to your best referrers the next time someone is in need of your exemplary services.
