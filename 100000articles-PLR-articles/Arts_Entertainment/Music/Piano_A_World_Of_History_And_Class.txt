Pianos have entertained thousands over the last century or 2. When we think about this grand instrument, composers like Mozart and Beethoven come to mind. The piano's got their boost in the hundred years between 1790 and 1890. Yes, during the industrial revolution. This is when stronger steel and iron was manufactured.

The first company in Britain that manufactured pianos was the Broadwood. They made big and excellent sounding instruments. By 1820 however, the piano had moved to Paris through the Erard. Erard also invented the double action where the piano could be played even the key was fully up allowing for rapid playing.

All manufacturers used this technique as time went on.

They required muscle power to depress the keys to produce good quality sounds. However, as time went on, softer strings were made that reduced this tension.

A modern day piano has 88 keys and miner. This key set represents all 7 octaves and the miners as well.

All modern musicians face a problem however. Due to the large evolution of the piano, the compositions of greats like Mozart and Chopin are no longer meant for these instruments. The instruments that these composers used no longer exist. So a long and arduous task of interpretation is required before they can be played on the modern pianos.

Not withstanding the above problem, pianos have still got that beautiful sense of music about them. Today musicians like Yanni control your emotions using this instrument. Some even believe that piano music can help cure health problems. Indian classical music has such measures in its music.

Pianos have always been attractive to people who like beauty and romance. They have been appealing to classical tastes as well. Producing haunting, cheerful and beautiful music, the piano can never be forgotten. That is why so many people own them in their home and why even more wish they had one of their very own to sit at and play. There are not many things as relaxing as sitting down at your piano after a long hard days work.
