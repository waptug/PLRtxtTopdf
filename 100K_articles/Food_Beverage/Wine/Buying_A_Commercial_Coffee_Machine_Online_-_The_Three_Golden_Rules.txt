With a growing number of websites offering coffee machines at increasingly affordable prices, buying a coffee machine online can be a great way to save time and money. But there are three golden rules you should follow when purchasing your machine, and these should help you find the best machine for your business.

1. Make sure you buy from an established and reputable company. It may seem entirely obvious, but please do make sure that the company you choose has a reliable reputation and that shopping with them is known to be secure. Read up on their privacy policy and make sure you are satisfied that they won’t use your personal details for anything other than processing your order.

2. Do your research. There are so many types of coffee machine out there that it can seem like a daunting task trying to figure out just which one is right for you. But you should take the time to look through your options: read the specifications for the different coffee makers and make sure that you think not just about the basic features of the different coffee makers, but also the extras that the different machines are fitted with.

3. Check installation and warranty information. Most coffee machines should come with an instruction manual, however some also include installation in the price of the machine- having someone come out and install the machine for you can save time and hassle, particularly if you are buying a complex machine. Also make sure that the machine you buy has a decent warranty- it is likely to be an expensive piece of equipment, so it is important that you are covered if anything goes wrong.

Follow these three basic rules and you will be well on the way to finding the ideal commercial coffee machine. Good luck!
