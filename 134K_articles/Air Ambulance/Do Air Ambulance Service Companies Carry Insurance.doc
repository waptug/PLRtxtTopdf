}Do Air Ambulance Service Companies Carry Insurance?\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 In today\u8217
\'92s society, it seems that everyone is concerned about insurance and liability
.  No, this article is not focusing on health insurance coverage for services involving
 the transportation of a patient with an air ambulance.  We are focusing here on
 liability insurance and malpractice insurance coverage that should be in place 
for each air ambulance.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Just like
 every motorist who drives a car should possess liability insurance, each air ambulance
 should carry liability coverage.  An air ambulance should carry at least a minimum
 of $20 million in aircraft liability coverage.  Of course, patients would never
 hope to need to worry about such coverage, but knowing that the air ambulance service
 carries this coverage can be reassuring and provide confidence for the client.  
Companies who carry the appropriate amount of coverage indicate their reputation
.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Just like
 any doctor\u8217\'92s office or medical transport service that travels by ground
, medical malpractice insurance coverage is essential.  Patients and their families
 long to avoid the worries about a malpractice situation, but in reality, the risk
 does exist.  For this reason, each air ambulance should have a minimum of $1 million
 policy for medical malpractice coverage.  Again, no one wants to use such coverage
, but knowing that an air ambulance company carries such excellent insurance, will
 help to ensure that the air ambulance service is reputable.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 As you would
 feel uncomfortable traveling with a motorist who didn\u8217\'92t carry the appropriate
 insurance coverage, you would want to reconsider traveling with an air ambulance
 service who discards the need for liability insurance.  Likewise, all good doctors
 carry malpractice     insurance.  Air ambulance companies should do the same.      
\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 As you compare
 companies that provide air ambulance services, you may want to consider checking
 in on the coverage amounts for both liability aircraft insurance and medical malpractice
 insurance.  Air ambulance companies are not required to give out pertinent insurance
 information, but reputable companies will be happy to answer any and all of your
 questions about their insurance coverage and minimums.  Some companies will provide
 a standard copy of information regarding liability and medical malpractice insurance
 coverage with the other paperwork that is involved with the processing information
 to request air ambulance service.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 All reputable
 air ambulance companies and organizations have the best interest of the patient
 at heart.  These air ambulance services will undoubtedly be eager to discuss and
 explain any questions or concerns you have in regards to their levels of liability
 and medical malpractice insurance.  If the air ambulance company is unwilling to
 discuss this with the patient or the family, then it may be advisable to look to
 another company that will help to ease your concerns.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 It is  Important
 to find an air ambulance service that makes you feel the most at ease.  During 
this time of medical necessity, stress can be high.  Knowing that the patient is
 being transported by an air ambulance service that is responsible and carries excellent
 insurance coverage can provide insight into the type of organization it is.  A 
reputable company will do their utmost best to provide assurance to everyone involved
 to create an environment of peace of mind for their clients.  \par}
