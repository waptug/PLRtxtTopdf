Article Body:
When I first set out to find new ways of earning money online, Cash Crate was the first GPT (get paid to) program I came across.  Assuming it was just another internet scam, I skimmed their website and moved on.  But a few days later I couldn't stop wondering about it.  If their claims were true this could be a nice extra income stream for me. Not really expecting much, I went ahead and signed up.  Now, several months and several hundred dollars later, I can tell you that Cash Crate is definitely NOT a scam.  After having a good experience with them, I went on to sign up for several other GPT sites, many of which I have made quite a bit of money at, but Cash Crate remains my favorite for several reasons, which I will address in this review. 

What Is Cash Crate?
Cash Crate is a Get Paid To site that allows you to earn money by taking surveys and completing trials and offers.  Companies are always looking for consumers to try their products or services.  GPT programs, such as Cash Crate are hired by advertising companies to provide these leads. Cash Crate gets paid by these companies; they then pass on up to 75% back to us. 

How Are You Paid?
Cash Crate automatically sends you a check each month for the previous month’s earnings.  All you need to do is earn a minimum of $10 to each month to qualify for payment.  I can't even begin to tell you how easy this is.  I was able to do this within the first few hours of working with Cash Crate.  Within a few days I was up to over $50. 

Do You Need to Refer Anybody to Earn Money?
Absolutely NOT.  You can earn quite a bit of money without referring a single person.  If you are like me though and enjoy recruiting new members, there is a very good income to be made this way as well.  

Cash Crate has one of the best referral programs available in the GPT industry.  This is one of the reasons that Cash Crate remains my favorite GPT site.  Cash Crate's excellent referral program makes it not only lucrative, but also easy to refer others to.  In my experience, once people understand the power behind this referral program they are very eager to join.  

Cash Crate pays you 20% of what your referrals earn and 10% of what their referrals earn.  Plus once your referral earns enough to cashout for their first time (only $10) they also give you a $3 bonus.  Once you have 50 active referrals under you they raise your referral commissions to 25%! 

I compared Cash Crate's referral system to other GPT sites and this is what I found: Between the high referral rates offered by Cash Crate, their quick crediting, and consistent payment history, Cash Crate holds the most earning potential.  After several months of working with close to 20 different GPT sites, I can tell you that I consistently earn far more money at Cash Crate than any other GPT site.
