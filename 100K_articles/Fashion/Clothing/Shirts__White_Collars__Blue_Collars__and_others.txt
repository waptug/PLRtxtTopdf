<p align="justify">If you&rsquo;re unsure about what color your collar should  be - the short answer is to have options. Your choice of color is one  of the most important considerations when choosing the <a href="http://www.tailor.com/style_catalog.asp"><strong>style</strong></a> of your  business shirt collar. </p>
<p><strong>White Collars</strong></p>
<p align="justify">For a white <a href="http://www.tailor.com/products.asp?maincatid=1"><strong>shirt</strong></a>, the collar should always be white  and made from the same fabric as the rest of the shirt. The only  exception to this rule is the tuxedo shirt which may incorporate  another white (textured) fabric for the shirt front (bib) and the  cuffs. </p>
<p>The white shirt was previously a uniform requirement at IMB and a  plain white shirt still communicates efficiency, aptitude, and  professionalism.</p>
<p align="justify">For stripes, checks and solid colors, Gordon Gecko&rsquo;s  contrast white collar is still a great look on Wall Street. A contrast  white collar (with white cuffs) is all about the big city, big deals,  and big money. If you&rsquo;re visiting a big city from a smaller city, a  contrast white collar can communicate that you&rsquo;re a genuine player and  not intimidated by the big smoke. </p>
<p align="justify"> If, on the other hand, you&rsquo;re visiting a smaller  city from New York, the contrast white collar can be a big turn off to  blue collar management. Gecko&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Greed is good,&rdquo; mantra appeals to  some, but not to all. You don&rsquo;t want to come across as a slick, big  city executive when you&rsquo;re selling farming machinery in Arkansas.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Blue Collars</strong></p>
<p align="justify">When dealing with manufacturing operations as well  as businesses in smaller communities, a blue shirt (with a matching  collar) is a staple ingredient in a businessman&rsquo;s wardrobe. </p>
<p align="justify">Unlike the white shirt which often represents  administrative efficiency, the blue collared shirt represents a  connection with physical work, engineering, and problem solving. When  visiting agricultural sites, a button down blue collar shirt (always  worn with a single breasted jacket) conveys both respect and discretion  &ndash; with or without a tie.</p>
<p align="justify">For those business situations that require your  multi-faceted understanding of finance, administration, manufacturing,  and sales, a light blue shirt will fit the bill.</p>
<p><strong>Others&hellip;</strong></p>
<p align="justify">There are a myriad plaids, stripes, checks, dots,  weaves, and color combinations to choose from when you&rsquo;re looking for a  business shirt. If you don&rsquo;t usually wear a tie, compliment a solid  jacket (or suit) with a bright, colorful shirt. If you wear ties,  ensure that your tie and shirt do not compete for attention. An easy  rule of thumb is to wear plainer shirts with busy ties and plainer ties  with busy shirts. </p>
<p align="justify">Unless you&rsquo;re latest recording has just gone  platinum, be cautious of combining a busy <a href="http://www.tailor.com/suits.asp?maincatid=2"><strong>suit</strong></a>, with a busy shirt, and  a busy tie. That being said, if you&rsquo;re confident in your own good  taste, mix it up and show the world who you are. The choice of your  collar color is sure to speak volumes about your personal style. </p>
