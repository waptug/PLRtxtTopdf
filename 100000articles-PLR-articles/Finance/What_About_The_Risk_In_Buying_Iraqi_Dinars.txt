Scenario 1: All the troops leave Iraq suddently and total chaos breaks out.
 
Scenario 2: The 'rebels' join forces and kick out all the foreign troops and the new government.
 
Scenario 3: The troops leave for economic reasons. The costs are too high. Enough oil to cover that?
 
Scenario 4: The terror will hold off Iraq's prosperity.
 
Of course there are a lot of other variables to consider. I mean, is Iraq going to be strong enough to rise again? Can the dinar cope with all these buyers? And on and on. It is very hard to predict Iraq's future. 
 
Maybe the 'war' takes longer then expected and people start selling their dinars even at a lower price. Maybe the more patient people will laugh as last? Again, just educate yourself before making a decision on wether to buy the Iraqi dinar or not.
