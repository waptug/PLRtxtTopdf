In order to remove spyware from your pc you will need a program that can detect search and destroy those unwanted programs. Once you remove the spyware program you can feel safe and free to surf the net. 

Many spyware programs can disrupt the normal operation of your computer. Most spyware programs will slow your system down because it is taking the time to log each and every one of your keystrokes. This log is then programmed to be sent off to a some one else's computer. They will then review your keystrokes for passwords and personal information. This is done so that they can steal your credit cards numbers and use your personal information to their advantage. 

If you suspect you are infected the first thing you want to do is to remove spyware right away. There are some good programs out on the net that will do this. Some remove spyware programs can be evil and cause even more problems for you. 

Spyware is a problem and there is always some one with bad ethics writing the software so they can take advantage of you. It is very important to protect yourself against spyware before you get infected. Sometimes it is hard to remove them once they have been downloaded to your pc.
