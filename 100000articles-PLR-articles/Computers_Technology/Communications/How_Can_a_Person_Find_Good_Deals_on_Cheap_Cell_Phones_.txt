There are a number of ways to get good deals on cheap cell phones. These methods range from buying phones at specific rates for various package deals to purchasing phones from third parties who can often give a person the best deal possible on their electronics. In any event, often the worst place a person can buy a cell phone is directly from the cell phone service provider. These businesses, like Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T, are known to charge more than the average retailer when it comes to their cell phone prices.
If you are looking for a cheap cell phone that has all of the features of a high end modern phone but for much less than half the price, look no further than third party online retailers. These are the stores that specialize in providing a full service package complete with cell phone, headset, extra batteries, and even a plan tied to a specific carrier. There is absolutely nothing that cannot be bought at one of these types of retailers. They’ll give you the best deal on cell phones, often with a rebate that far exceeds what other cell phone stores are offering, and buying a plan from them is a snap, too.

The other option is to take advantage of buying in bulk. Chances are that most people have seen the advertisements talking about how families can save money by all being on the same plan. The same goes for buying cell phones. Often, if a person decides to buy a phone directly from the cellular service provider, the provider will give a bulk discount for purchasing two or more of the same phone. All a customer needs to do is ask for a multi-phone discount.

Although these are two of the most popular ways to find a cheap cell phone, the most important thing a savvy consumer can do is shop around for a discount. If you are looking for a phone and you find one for a good price, keep checking. There may be someplace that offers a better deal than you thought.
