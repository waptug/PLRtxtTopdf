Cheap Air Filters versus High End Air Filters:  Which Is Best?

If you suffer from asthma or allergies or if you just want the air inside your home to be clean, you may be interested in buying an air purifier.  If you are, it is important to examine more than just the air purifier itself.  Since many air purifiers require replacement filters multiple times a year, they should also be a large part of your decision.  Although you may find it most cost effective, especially in the beginning, to buy an air purifier that uses cheaper air filters, you may want to rethink your decision.  This is because there are a number of benefits to using high end home air filters.

As you likely already know, air purifiers work to clean the air inside a home or a room.  They remove potentially harmful particles, which may include pet dander, pollen, dust mites, mold, and secondhand tobacco smoke.  As for how these air particulates are removed from the air, it is done so with the assistance of an air purifier.  Unfortunately, cheaper quality air purifiers may not produce the best results.  There are some brands where the particles are known to pass right through the filter, which results in a reentry into the air.  This is not how an air purifier should work.  That is why it is important to invest in a quality air purifier, as well as buy high end home air filters.

Although we all want to save money when shopping, it is important to remember that you get what you pay for.  As previously stated, air purifiers that use high end air filters do cost more money, but they will be more than worth it.  As for the cost of replacement filters, high end home air filters will also cost more money, but they are also more than worth it.  There is a reason why it is possible to purchase cheaper air filters than the more expensive ones.  It is because their quality is not the same.  If you suffer from asthma or allergies, you cannot afford to go cheap, as you may be putting your health at risk by doing so.

As previously stated, there are a number of benefits to high end air purifiers and high end home air filters.  The quality that you receive is just one of those benefits.  The money that you may be able to save overtime is another.  For starters air purifiers that come with high end filters installed in them already are likely to last much longer than some of the cheaper versions that are available for sale.  Also, when you purchase a high end replacement filter, you will see that they also last much longer.  This can save you a considerable amount of money overtime.  If you want proof, just compare the prices of air filters online, as well as the average amount of time that they last for.

Although you may be turned off by the cost of high end home air filters and air purifiers, you shouldn’t be.  You should actually look at your purchase as an investment, as you have the ability to save yourself money overtime.  You also shouldn’t let the health benefits escape you either.  As previously stated, high end air purifiers and air filters can help those that suffer from allergies and asthma, but they can also help reduce respiratory infections in otherwise healthy people.
