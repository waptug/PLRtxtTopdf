For music enthusiasts everywhere, the most modern version of portable music enjoyment is the MP3 player. A small and comprehensive system that holds your personal play lists, keeps track of your calendar, and even allows video function has revolutionized the way in which we are entertained. The MP3 player was designed for a modern society on the go; such technology allows us to enjoy music no matter where we are or what we are doing. The most popular system on the market today is the Apple iPod. The iPod’s infinite success has prompted a variety of companies to get into the game of MP3 technology – including Sonic Blue’s Rio MP3 player.

The MP3 player technology works to compress audio files to such a size that they can be contained in a much smaller physical space than traditional vinyl records or CDs. Users are able to download their favorite music – sometimes up to thousands of songs depending on the unit – and construct their own personal play lists that remain on their portable MP3 player. The Rio MP3 player is no different in this technology.

The Rio MP3 player is available in a number of different models offered at different price points. They include the Rio Karma, Rio Cali, Rio Chiba, CE2100, Forge Sport, Rio One, Carbon, Fuse Street, and the Nitrus – the first MP3 player to include a one-inch hard drive.

The Rio MP3 player has been marketed to people who have different needs from their MP3 player. Whether you listen to your MP3 player in your car, while working out, or at home, there is a Rio MP3 player that is right for you.

Consumers have responded to the Rio MP3 player for its affordable technology. While it does not provide all of the features popular to iPod or Microsoft Zune, it is an affordable option for those interested in having a MP3
