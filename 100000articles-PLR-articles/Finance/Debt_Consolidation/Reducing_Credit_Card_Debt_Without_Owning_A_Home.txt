Let the professionals work for you.

There are companies that specialize in negotiating with credit card companies. They are able to lower balances, reduce interest, and even remove fees. Allow one of these negotiation services to work on your behalf and you will be surprised at how much less you will owe almost immediately. Then to reduce your debt even more, start taking the money you save each month and apply it to your debt. The faster you pay off your debt the less interest you will owe.

Let the professionals do the budget for you.

Let’s face it, if budgeting were your strong suit, you probably would have a handle on your credit card spending. Sitting down with a professional credit counselor and letting them take a look at your budget and put you on the right track for your financial future. A credit counselor can even help you work out a payment schedule that will let you see a light at the end of the debt tunnel.

Tighten your belt and make some short term sacrifices.

It may not be the fun thing to do, but the reality is that unless you pay more than the minimum payment on your credit card balance, you will never get yourself out of debt. This might mean that for a year or two you will have to go without some of the luxuries your used to having. Make a list of the things in your life that are necessities and the things that are extras and then decide what things you can do without at least until you have a handle on your debt.
