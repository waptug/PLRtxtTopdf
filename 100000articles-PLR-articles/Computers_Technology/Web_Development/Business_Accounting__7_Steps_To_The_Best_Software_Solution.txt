So according to your accounting needs pick a decent accounting software at reasonable price

5.It is also important that your accounting software have all the features you need. It must have all the modules and reporting categories necessary for your business. Accounts payable and accounts receivable are some of the general modules an accounting software must have. Most of the accounting software come in different versions. You should look for a software which provides future versions also to match your future needs.

But you have to think about local support which is more feasible. A perfect after sales support must have a complete FAQ package, a toll-free call center, and local service center.

All in all, the best thing would be to shop around, read some reviews and invest in software with expandable features. Your software must be capable of handling your growth.
