Let’s talk about you for a minute.  Remember the last time you were telling someone that you just met that you don’t really like following trends and that you are your own person?  Haha, that was funny.  But seriously, the only problem with being someone (which is to say everyone) who gives great attention to outward appearance, as if it’s incredibly indicative to the what’s on the inside, is not admitting it.  I don’t care if your shirt has a little guy playing polo, the World Industries skeleton, the promo logo from the last environmental conference you were at, or a picture of Trent Reznor; you are trying to tell the world who you want them to think you are.  That bad news is that you do it, the good news is that you can continue to do it with your iPod video case.

So, what are you a scrappy new executive?  Well you don’t want your iPod case to clash with your handmade fine Italian leather daily planner.  No problem, go with the Incase Leather Folio for Ipod.  Its sophisticated and offers excellent protection.

Losing the style of your Ipod kind of bother you?  You need to go with the Agent 18 VideoShield for 30G iPods.  Its super tough, as its not the rubber skin-type, but hard cased.   The other great thing about this is that the casing is incredibly thin and practically invisible.

Are you a complete lunatic, like my friend Steve?  Then you’re probably enjoying your iPod right now, but thinking that its just a matter of time until you destroy it in a moment of madness.  Go with the Speck ToughSkin.  It offers the ultimate in protection in iPod video cases for those who really put their stuff to the test.  Its really rugged and you don’t need to change an iota of your behavior issues.

These are just a small example of the variety of iPod video cases that are out there.  There’s some many companies that are utilizing (and complimenting) iPods’ popularity that you’re bound to find something to meet your exact needs and style…because you’re an individual.
