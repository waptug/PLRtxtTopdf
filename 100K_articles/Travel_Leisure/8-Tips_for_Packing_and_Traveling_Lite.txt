How-to Pack & Travel Lite

Make a list. Compose a pack list. Be sure to coordinate shirts & blouses with bottoms. To maximize your travelling wardrobe fashion savoir faire, stick with solids & versatile basics. Rule-out any clothes that do not match other items. 

Use the following pithy packing tips to make your travel light:

Gear up. How to make an awe-inspiring impression out of a basic or mundane outfit? For the most glam appeal, accessorize with a vibrant tie (for him) or a florid scarf (for her). Multihued accessories can liven up just about any attire.

Roll 'em up please. The best way to fit all your clothes is by rolling pants & shirts. First fold each item in half. Then basically roll. To try to maintain any creases, start on the bulkiest end of the news story of clothing.

Employ shoe smarts. For men, any leather rubber-soled shoes can make the day & night transition, easy. For woman, a pair of flip-flops, strappy sandals & comfy wedges can serve all casual - chic dressing needs. 

Minimize bulk. After you check for space, edit outfits - ruthlessly. Try to pack microfibers with wrinkle & stain free comfort. With most of your attire, stay in the same color scheme - in case you have to layer up for warmth. 

Put under garments on the top. To reduce the embarrassment of under garments becoming the side show attraction of the open luggage scan, place all panties in a plastic bag free of any clippers, lighters or other questionable paraphernalia. For expedient security review, place the transparent bag on top of your other items so security can access the bag without ruining your efficient packing method. 

Lose Extra Baggage. Leave the heavy travel guide at home. Duplicate important resources to keep your luggage free of extra pounds. Since most hotels & resorts provide irons & blow-dryers --leave yours at home for light travel. 

Leave restricted items at home. If you want to make it through security extra speedy, avoid any firearms, weapons, box-cutters, scissors, razors, lighters & any other item that may be used in a terrorist situation.
