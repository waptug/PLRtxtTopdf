BRENDA BIERI, DDS - Dr. Bieri realized that a simple advertising tool such as the stock molar-shaped tooth magnet would be an excellent reminder and help advertise her clinic. She realized that participating in the "Career Day Event" at the local Middle School as a volunteer, and giving away a molar-shaped to each student, they will appreciate her consideration! God knows our community helpers rarely have the money to spend on goodwill tokens! This community advertising produced excellent results to her practice.
