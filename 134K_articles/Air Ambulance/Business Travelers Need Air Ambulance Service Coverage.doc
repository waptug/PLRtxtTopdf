}Business Travelers Need Air Ambulance Service Coverage\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Do you travel
 frequently away from home due to your specific job requirements?  Business travel
 has increased dramatically over the past few decades.  More and more, men and women
 are sent hundreds of miles away from home to perform business duties.  In many 
cases, travelers are even sent out of their home country on business.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The good 
business traveler comes prepared for the trip with all of the appropriate luggage
, business files, and a laptop, but often something is missing.  You may think you
 leave home fully prepared for the trip, but in reality, you are vulnerable.  The
 business traveler may not be prepared for a medical emergency during the trip.  
Emergencies can happen anytime and anywhere.  Just for this reason, people who travel
 away from home on frequent business trips should be prepared for such an emergency
.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Although 
no one ever wants to use air ambulance services, it is possible that such a need
 may arise.  The cost of a trip in an air ambulance can be extremely expensive.  
Fees can range from $10,000 to $75,000 per trip.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Business 
travelers really should consider purchasing air ambulance service coverage for those
 times when they are away from home.  Not all air ambulance service coverage providers
 offer equal coverage.  Carefully read the fine-print and examine the policy with
 caution.  It is important to know when air ambulance service is covered, when it
 is available, and at what charge to you.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Do your best
 to select a plan that will allow you to be transported by a medically staffed air
 ambulance under any health condition.  Be certain that you are able to determine
 the destination.  It won\u8217\'92t be helpful to be dropped off at some random
 hospital along the route that is still miles from home.  It is important that you
 be transported to the hospital of your choice, especially if you are concerned 
about being near family or at a hospital in your health insurance network.  \par

an air ambulance service coverage\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Plan that
 has no conditions about pre-existing health conditions is very important.  As you
 read the details of the coverage plan, try to look for any loopholes that exclude
 coverage.  If too many exclusions apply, look elsewhere for reputable coverage.

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Companies
 and corporations can supply air ambulance service coverage for business travelers
 at a reduced rate to the employees or as part of a benefits package.  Speak to 
your employer today to find out if this option is available for you.  If coverage
 is not available through your employer, it is wise to search for this coverage 
on your own to protect yourself, your family, and your finances.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The next 
time you travel away from home, don\u8217\'92t just grab your files and your computer
.  Bring with you confidence and peace of mind that you are covered in an emergency
.  Should you need to be transported by an air ambulance while away on business, 
you will know that you can protect your wallet with service coverage.  When an emergency
 arises, you can quickly be transferred to a hospital near home and family without
 incurring the outrageous expense.      }}
