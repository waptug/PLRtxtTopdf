#1. MOVIE MAKER. Starts with a story THEY really want to tell. Anything THEY are excited about. Something that they were/are touched by, something that affected them or connects with them somehow.

YOU: A successful network marketer starts with a story - one YOU really want to tell. A story is not a promise about what will happen to someone else. The story you tell is based on your experience with say, the product. You RELATE something that happened to you, or affected you, or how something is aligned perfectly with something else that's important to you. That has the makings of a story.

(E.g. Say you had achy knees for months and were nervous about surgey. You tried 7 different GNC or health store products, and nothing seemed to do much. Then one day you tried this other product and lo! Your achy knees lessened in a week or so, and now, 6 months later, you've even playing tennis again.)

#2. MOVIE MAKER. Beginning movie makers usually try to sell their movie to the studios (and investors) by pitching it as something everyone will want to see. Who could say no to that, right? Think of the income!

YOU: Many beginning network marketers pitch their products (or business) as something everyone will want because well, they're just the best thing out there, aren't they? How to get everyone to love them is the only obstacle. Indeed.

But Whole Foods isn't for everyone is it? Yet their business is booming. Whether you shop there or not, even. Madonna isn't for everyone, is she? But does she need everyone to be financially wildly successful? You name something, I'll tell you that everyone DOES NOT LOVE IT or want it. Sniff.

No one has ever had even close to everyone to make a success of things. "Almost no one" will do fine, actually. Like a few hundred customers for your product line, of the 300 million people in the U.S., say.

Savvy movie makers have long abandoned the "for everyone" pitch. In Hollywood, the smart ones talk about "finding your audience." This is what you should do. Because nothing is for everyone. Not even God.
