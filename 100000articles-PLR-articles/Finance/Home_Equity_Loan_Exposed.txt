Article Body:
The home equity loan is a loan in which you, the owner of your home, use your home equity (the value of your interest in your property or your home's fair market value and the unpaid balance of the outstanding home mortgage) as a collateral. 
A home equity loan is sometimes useful to help finance or refinance major home repairs, medical bills or even college education, and for this reason a home equity loan, creating a secured loan against the borrower's house, reduces the actual home equity, and eventually the home value.
Home equity loan is provided by several major banks, and usually these providers give better rates than unsecured loans by second tier providers. Your home equity loan must be evaluated carefully and the provider chosen only once you have done your due diligence. SixLoan.com provides a list of some of the best websites where you can find and evaluate a convenient home equity loan; however, we encourage you to visit as many websites as possible yourself, as the home equity loan websites featured, although they represent the best resources for home equity loan, are just the tip of the iceberg in the very broad sea of home equity loan. Gather a lot of information and study your home equity loan very carefully prior to chose any provider; this may seem obvious, but too many homeowners jump too quickly to the first home equity loan offer. Besides, it should not be forgotten that everything is negotiable: so do negotiate your home equity loan as even a small fraction of a percentage point may make a huge difference over the period of your home equity loan. 
Finally, it should be kept in mind that a home equity loan is not the only possible alternative. Other forms of financing may be available to you, and most of these do not require you to secure the loan against your home equity. The downside could be that the interest you are going to pay will be higher for an unsecured loan. So if you need financing you may want to consider the so-called payday loans, or if you are trying to finance or refinance your college education you may want to think to the so-called student consolidation loan; these may be valid alternatives to a home equity loan. Besides, if you do not own a home (you are renting for example) you are not eligible for a home equity loan and need to explore alternative loan solutions.
In conclusion, if you were to visit just one website or resource for your home equity loan, we would suggest “reference sites” such as FreddieMac.com; however, do not stop there. A site like SixLoan.com may be of help too: in fact, the more information the better, but as a general advise stick with well-known names and home equity loan lenders and providers as they can offer you more options and guarantees. In addition, we believe it is also important to speak to some consultant in person, so do not forget to check local branches of national lender where you could meet face to face and talk about a suitable home equity loan.
