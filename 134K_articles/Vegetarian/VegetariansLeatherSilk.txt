Why Some Vegetarians Do Not Wear Leather And Silk

Most vegetarians who stop eating meat for ethical 
reasons also take measures to avoid contributing to the
suffering and death of animals (and even insects) in other 
capacities. For instance, a number of vegetarians refuse to
wear leather and silk because they see it as an ethical
violation of their respect for all living things.

Vegetarians who refuse to wear silk argue that the process
involves unnecessary cruelty to moth larvae. Rather than
allowing the moth to grow and leave the cocoon, silk 
manufacturers boil the larvae alive, causing them to suffer
and writhe, in order to obtain longer strands of silk.

Leather, by contrast, does not directly contribute to the 
suffering of animals in most cases. In most cases, leather
is made from the byproducts of animals that would be 
slaughtered for meat, rennet, and other animal 
products.

This is precisely why many vegetarians who have an ethical
dilemma with meat have no problem wearing leather: because
they do not see it as the primary reason for killing the 
animals, but instead a byproduct of the slaughter.

However, certain groups of vegans oppose wearing leather 
on the grounds that it indirectly contributes to the 
suffering of animals.

These vegans argue that contributing money to the companies 
that own the slaughterhouses (and sell the byproducts for 
leather, etc.) is just as bad as actually purchasing and 
eating meat yourself because you are still contributing 
money to the continuation of institutionalized animal 
suffering.

This is certainly something to consider if you are 
currently a vegan or a vegetarian for ethical reasons. 
It may have been tough to give up meat in the first place,
but if you are truly committed to the cause and you 
believe the arguments are strong-enough, you may want 
to avoid clothing purchases that will aid institutions 
that cause animal suffering.
