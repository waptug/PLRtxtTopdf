Being a parent is a huge responsibility. Many of us jump into the challenge with little knowledge of what's to come. Fortunately things tend to fall into place anyway. The way we care for our little ones comes as natural as combing our hair or riding a bike. And if we get confused along the way, our parents and friends are typically there to offer a lending hand. Hey, that's what they're for, right? But that's not all! Having a child in this new millennium means having extra new-age resources. The Internet provides us with plenty parents kids websites. This allows us to get assistance with an issue immediately. 

Like the rest of the planet, I'm sure you're jacked into cyberspace for a good portion of the day. The web is where it's at! And by IT, I mean virtually everything. Once in a while I even refer to parents kids sites to attain useful advice. Hey, raising a child is not all fun and games. They certainly know how to hit you with a curve ball by the time they hit their teen years. This is when you might find it beneficial to take advantage of the parents' forums that discuss teens. There is plenty to be learned from other mothers and fathers, and all the things they've been through. I learned how to deal with my teenager, who was not doing her homework. As advised by a fellow parent, I simply took away her car, computer, and cell phone privleges. After two weeks of suffering with no connection to her buddies, she straightened out rather well. Her grades resumed normalcy in no time. Granted this is a minor issue, but still important when you're a parent. I realized that spanking didn't work!
