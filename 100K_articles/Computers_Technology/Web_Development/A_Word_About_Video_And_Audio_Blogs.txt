Blogs are revolutionizing the way businesses interact with their customers. To elevate blogs to the next level, you may want to embed video in your business blog. Video is becoming increasingly in demand online. If you heard of YouTube, you know the impact of video online. Why not take advantage of this revolution? You can make your blog more entertaining when you include video. You may provide short clips about using your products, or you could make short presentations about your services.

Don’t confuse video blogs with online commercials, because the two are not at all the same. Video blogs are not supposed to be shameless plugs or infomercials. When you offer video in your blog you are providing valuable information in a different form. Instead of entertainment, think value. That, of course, doesn’t mean that your video should be boring. On the contrary, the more exciting you make it the more buzz it will generate. Webinars are quite common tools that would benefit your blog.

We won't go into the details of how to get your videos on your blog, but it is easier than you think. Don’t worry if you don’t have video equipment worth millions of dollars. Most digital video recorders are more sophisticated to day than much of the video equipment professionals have used in the past.

One of the most important aspect of video to remember is that it is using much more bandwidth than text. Be sure you check with your hosting company to make sure there is enough bandwidth for you to embed video in your blog. As video is becoming ever more popular, video hosting providers have made it very easy for the end user to add video content to their blogs.

Most popular video sharing sites such as YouTube, Google Video, etc will auto-generate code that you can cut and paste into your blog post. The most widely implemented blog backend providers such as TypePad and WordPress, have both a WYSIWYG and an HTML tab for writing and editing posts. This functionality is very similar to what many people are used to seeing in popular web-page building programs like Adobe's Dreamweaver. Most blogging software allows you to paste the video embeded code into the HTML tab of your post.
