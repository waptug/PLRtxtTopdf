<b> 2. </b> Cummerbunds or bow tie
Some of you may prefer bow ties instead of neck ties that also come in various colors and styles. Bow ties can be self tied or pre tied but the range of pre tied ones is far more than the self tied. Many bow ties come with matching cummerbunds and could be ideal match for your wedding dress.

If your wedding color scheme is “standard” color, you can choose a close match ties or cravats that are widely available. 

<b> 4. </b> To hire or buy
In formal weddings, suits and other items can be hired or purchased whereby if you hire the item, you can save a considerable amount of money especially in the case of suits. In neck ties, it could be more difficult because the shop could have a limited number of ties or cravats. The most popular wedding neck ties come in plain polyester satin or silk fabric that you can hire at $10 -$15 for a fair good value. 

<b> 5. </b> Clean and take care of your ties
Once you have bought your ties, make sure that they are not creased or crumpled. For this, lay them flat or hang on a tie rack. While you try them, you should completely undo nay knots and hang up the tie for couple of days so that the lines from the knot clear. If on the day of wedding something spills on the tie just dab it with a dry cloth so that it soaks up as much as possible. If it is something like fruit juice or gravy let it dry and then gently dab it with the narrow end of the tie. Silk and polyester fabric reacts differently so this method will help a little. Don’t iron the tie for any reason and never iron it directly instead cover it with a cotton cloth and then iron on a cool setting.
