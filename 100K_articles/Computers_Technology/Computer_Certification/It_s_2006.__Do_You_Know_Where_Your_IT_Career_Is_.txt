Article Body:
Whether you're thinking of starting a career with computers and information technology, or thinking about earning a professional certification such as the CCNA or MCSE to accelerate your career, there is no better time to start than today. Silicon Valley is hiring again, and while we all can't work for Google, IT hiring is at its highest level in years and the opportunities for driven, motivated individuals are unlimited.

I also know that for many of us, the holiday season is a good excuse to put off those studies!  "I'll study for the CCNA after Thanksgiving..." "I'll start working on my CCNP after the New Year..."  Well, guess what - the new year is here. 

It's 2006.  Where is your IT career?  Are you actively studying to earn a certification, or are you still thinking about it?  Are you attending a school to break into the IT field, or are you still thinking about it?

Newton's First Law Of Motion states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest, and an object at motion tends to stay in motion. This is true of careers as well, including yours.  Where do you want your career to be in one year?  Do you want to have earned several certifications in that time, therefore advancing your career, or do you want to be in the exact same place you are today?

The only person who can make this decision is you. And I can speak from experience that when you begin putting your career into motion - the possibilities are unlimited.  But you have to get started - today!
