}Save Money on your Next ATV Purchase\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 If you have
 an ATV, you know how expensive the hobby can be. ATV\u8217\'92s can be very expensive
 and the parts and costs of maintenance can also be high. If you have to do emergency
 repairs of even replace a badly damaged ATV you may find yourself strapped for 
cash. The initial ATV purchase is also a major expense, especially if you buy new
. It is possible to save money, keep to a budget, and enjoy ATV riding. You should
 still be prepared to invest money in your hobby but if you do some research, you
 can find good prices on ATV\u8217\'92s and ATV parts.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Most ATV 
retailers whether they are a local dealership or an online dealer, run sales periodically
. You should do some independent research and decide which model and brand of ATV
 you want. Unless you get lucky, you may have to end up waiting a while for a sale
 but the price difference will be worth it. Always check to see what the regular
 price of the model you want to and compare dealerships both locally and online. 
Once you know what the average non-sale price is of the ATV you want, all you have
 to do is wait for it to go on sale. Most ATV dealerships have sales twice a year
 or so, and as long as you are patient you can potentially save hundreds. You should
 avoid going to a dealer before you know what price to expect because it is easy
 to be talked into buying an ATV because a sales person says that they have the 
best price. Always do you own research to find out what the best price really is
.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Most ATV 
owners spend money every year replacing or adding parts to their ATV\u8217\'92s. 
This can get costly if you pay retail every time you replace something. Just like
 ATV\u8217\'92s, ATV parts will go on sale periodically so the trick to saving when
 you buy parts is to wait until their on sale and know what the best price you can
 expect is through research. This may not seem practical as you never know when 
something will break and will not want to wait months to fix it. The solution to
 this dilemma is to buy parts that you know you will eventually need when they are
 on sale, even if you do not need them at the time. You will save money in the long
 run if you have a replacement part you need that you bought at a discount. Supplies
 for regular ATV maintenance can also be costly over time so you should grab them
 when they are on sale and save yourself money. \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Many people
, especially if they have a new ATV, have not considered buying used ATV parts. 
If you need to replace something on your ATV, most of the time a used part will 
work just a well as a new one and will save you money. Just because a part is used
 or refurbished does not necessarily mean that it is of inferior quality. Most of
 the time a used part will work just as well as a new one and you will pay a fraction
 of the price.\par}
