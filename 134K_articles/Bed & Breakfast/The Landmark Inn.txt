The Landmark Inn


Tis the dream of many to spend the night in a bank. Well that opportunity has just presented itself via The Landmark Inn, in Oberlin, Kansas. The 1886 bank of Oberlin has been converted into the modern bed and breakfast now called the Landmark Inn. The name even celebrates two major events, the opening of the US land office and the founding of the bank of Oberlin. Each of the rooms celebrates a special landmark or person in Oberlin or Kansas history. Meals are served in the teller room restaurant.

After the bank failed, the building became the county courthouse. In honor of this, we have the Judges Chambers Suite. Mauve, green and purple wallpaper and curtains surround the tall walnut queen-sized bed. A Victorian settee completes the bedroom and a claw foot tub occupies the bath. 

Named after the founder of the bank, the R.A. Marks Suite has a spoon carved queen-sized bedroom set. There is also a vintage Murphy bed. Named after the furniture style of the room, the Cottage Victorian Suite is filled with stenciled pine furnishings. 

The antique appearing gas fireplace lends its name to The Fireside Suite. Here we find a full sized canopy bed and a bath covered with antique advertising items. There is also a sitting room with Victorian furniture. 

The Carriage house Suite is a two-room suite with a mission style queen-size bed. The sitting room is adorned with wicker furniture and a second pull down bed. 

The Ad Astra Suite is so named because of the state motto, "To the stars through difficulties."  Fully handicap accessible, this room is done in blues and mauves. Finally we have arrived at the Courtyard Suite. Here we find a queen-size antique brass and cast iron bed. There is also a two person Jacuzzi for gentle relaxing.
