As with everything in the manufacturing industry, cost is a major thing and is this issue that has the biggest determination over the overall price at the end. So with this point in mind it would be worth mentioning how this point help will help the consumer in 2 ways. 

First reason is, because aluminium is so easy to produce and the cost to the manufacturer in low, the customer never really has to pay extra for a bar stool, it does not unjustifiably increase the end product's price.

The second would have to the shipping costs, because aluminium is so much lighter than any other metal that would be used to make bar stools or even wood the shipping costs would be less. Unless you can find a good deal and get free shipping then the heavier materials that some bar would cost an absolute fortune to ship especially if is to be shipped over seas.

Another advantage that aluminium makes doable is its ability to copy the polished stainless steel effect. Stainless steel is a far heavier and more costly metal, both of these points will mean increased costs on such items as barstools. Since aluminium can be made to closely match any other metal on th market and if you consider that point, is there any reason that that you should ever choice a heavier metal for your bar stool.

From the barstool manufacturer's perspective, aluminium is an attractive metal for all the reasons listed above, mainly for its design applications and many weight properties.
