When planning travelling to the Costa Blanca and Benidorm, you will want to consider accommodation options. This city is built for tourism and there are many choices available in terms of a place to stay. Do some research on the internet to determine where you want to stay during your visit. Compare hotel and property rentals to help you make a decision.

Book your reservations early, especially if you plan to travel during the busier times of the year. In this region, the summer months are the busiest. Hotels and apartments tend to fill up quickly during these months. If you are planning a summer vacation, book your hotel room or property rental at least six months in advance.
 
Plenty of Hotels to choose from in Benidorm
 
There are over 170 hotels in Benidorm. With this many to choose from, it shouldn’t be too difficult to find a hotel that will fit your needs. Hotel choices range from basic accommodations to five star luxury hotels. Consider the amenities you want when looking for a place to stay.

Read reviews of a variety of hotels to get an idea of what is available. Reviews can be found in travel magazines or on the internet. Look for websites that offer reviews written by consumers. These are good because they are written by people who have stayed at each hotel. Many websites offer pictures of the hotel from the outside, as well as pictures of the rooms.

Compare amenities as well as prices. Larger hotels will have swimming pools, restaurants and may be closer to attractions than smaller, less expensive places. Consider what is important for your vacation. If you are travelling with children in the summer, you may want a hotel with a pool and other activities for the kids to enjoy.
 
Finding Apartments 
 
If you are planning to stay for a longer vacation, you may want to consider renting an apartment. Families sometimes prefer the privacy and home like atmosphere of an apartment, rather than a hotel. Property rentals can be found through travel agents, Benidorm based real estate agents and on the internet. An agent based in the city will be able to give you the best information on the properties and areas in which rentals are available.

In some cases, you may be able to deal directly with the owner of the property for a rental. This can save you money, since you won’t need to pay commission to a real estate agent. Property owners often advertise rentals on the internet and in travel magazines. You may have to do a bit more searching with this method than when dealing directly with an agent.

An apartment will have at least a small kitchen. This will allow you to prepare light meals, such as breakfast or lunch in the apartment. Eating some meals in the apartment will save you money on food costs. In addition, it is more relaxing to enjoy a light breakfast before heading out for the day. A small kitchen is nice when children get hungry between meals or late in the evening.

Compare prices for a hotel and an apartment rental. For longer stays, an apartment may actually be the better deal. This is especially true when prices are compared with higher priced hotels. The time of year is another consideration in terms of price. Prices will be higher in the peak season, than at other times of the year.

Look early for rentals, especially if you want to be near the beach. These tend to fill up fast, particularly in the summer. It’s best to start looking at least six months in advance if you are looking to stay in a certain area. If you are more flexible in where you want to stay, you may be able to find something on shorter notice.
