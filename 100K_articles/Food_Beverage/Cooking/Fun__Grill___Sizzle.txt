Gas grills have metal box. At the bottom of the box, there are tube-shaped liquid propane burners which are responsible in providing the grills with fuel. Traditionally, propane or natural gas fuel the gas grills. With them, grilling is made faster and easier.

3. Lava rock system is also good in collecting grease that can result to flare-ups. Try to look for them in the gas grill that you are to purchase.

4. For easy and safe gas grill lighting, be sure to have a push-button ignition. 

5. To monitor fuel levels your gas grill must have gas gauge.

7. For easy cleaning, the best gas grill material will be stainless steel or porcelain.
