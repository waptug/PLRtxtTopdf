One of the best ways to secure a quality seat for an event is by using a ticket broker. Ticket brokers specialize in obtaining premium seats, but also at a premium price! 

      •Always use an established ticket broker that is a good standing member of the BBB or other professional industry                 organization such as the NATB (National Association of Ticket Brokers). 
     •Make sure that you know you are not dealing with the box office itself, rather a third party broker and know how brokers            operate. 
     •Ticket Brokers charge a premium price above what is listed on the ticket at the face value. They do not charge face               value for tickets! 
    •Ticket brokers will determine ticket prices by the supply and demand of each particular event. Tickets could range from        a few dollars over the face value to hundreds of dollars above the face value. It all depends on the market value for the          event. 
    •Ticket brokers are much like travel agents or stockbrokers. They have access to everything you need to know about             seating, venues, upcoming shows, and available tickets from industry sources. 
    •Ticket brokering is a very competitive business. Look for a broker that provides good, professional and courteous             service. 
    •Ticket brokers will often only ship tickets to the address listed on your credit card billing statement. This is for your own
      personal consumer safety. If an alternate shipping address is requested, ticket brokers may ask for a copy of a driver’s        license. Don’t be alarmed, it’s a measure taken for your own consumer safety! 

Ticket brokers provide a safe, secure and professional way to buy quality tickets. Just be prepared to pay a premium fee for the service they provide. Be sure to check out our recommended broker sites below:
