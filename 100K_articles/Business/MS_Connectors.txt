MS connectors needs no tools for coupling and assembling of the connectors when attaching cables to equipment. MS connecor can be coupled by inserting the coupling nut of barrel into the receptacle and turning to the screw direction.These MS connectors are designed for use in fixed or mobile military equipment, industrial machine tools, robotics and automation, trucks, buses, ships aircraft etc.
Jetronics India, established as Manufacturers of Ms Connectors in 1985, has grown into a leading producer and exporter of MS connectors, MIL C 5015 grade electrical connectors and related accessories like MG Connectors, Circular Threaded Coupling Connectors, MS 25042 connectors, MS 25043 connectors, Reverse Bayonet connectors, 121B connectors, Military connectors, MIL 5015 connectors, VG 95234 connectors, Military connectors.

Originally designed as military connector, current applications widely centre on industrial uses. 
Circular Threaded Coupling connectors
These connectors are thread coupled and are in conformity to operating requirements of MIL C 5015 specifications for various industrial applications and are used in both military and commercial applications. MIL-C-5015 are the most popular of all cylindrical connectors for general use in electronic interconnection systems. These connectors are known for their supreme reliability, high power carrying capacity, their inherent ruggedness and capacity to withstand extreme environmental conditions. Typical circular connectors have pins mounted into an insert within the connectors. Disposed around the insert is a movable coupling nut which can be twisted to allow the coupling nut to threadedly engage the mating receptacle connector
