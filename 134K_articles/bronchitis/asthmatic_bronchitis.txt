In the beginning, very few illnesses and diseases were known, people would suffer from different ailments mysterious to them. As time passed, the number of diseases cropping up continued to increase. Millions of people acquire illnesses at some point in their lives; from common colds, coughs, to cancers and heart ailments. Though these illnesses or diseases have medications, it's still best to stay healthy. Prevention is still better than cure, as many people always say.

Perhaps you've heard about bronchitis. This is the irritation and inflammation of a human's bronchial tubes and adjacent tissues and organs involved in the breathing process. Bronchial tubes filter the air before it reaches the lungs, and are covered with hair-like things called cilia. Prolonged exposure to irritants can break the defenses thereby causing infection and inflammation.

Asthmatic bronchitis is similar to bronchitis. This is a disease associated with the airways. If you have chronic bronchitis, it can develop into asthmatic bronchitis. This type of disease is quite difficult to identify and diagnose. The generated symptoms exhibited by an individual having asthmatic bronchitis are similar to other respiratory tract illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis, sinusitis, and emphysema.

Bronchial hyperactivity, immunologic abnormalities, and severe childhood infections can cause asthmatic bronchitis. Individuals suffering from serious chronic bronchitis and persistent asthma are susceptible to asthmatic bronchitis.

Bacterial infections lead to chronic bronchitis; but with asthmatic bronchitis, small particles that passes though the cilia in the bronchial tubes triggers this disease; the airways and bronchial tubes become obstructed. Mucus is produced by the bronchial tubes to cover the trachea, lungs, and soft tissues involved in the breathing process. Due to irritants, the bronchial tubes produce an excessive amount of mucus thereby blocking air access. Constant blocking of the tract is a common occurrence among patients having asthmatic bronchitis.

Prolonged smoking and exposure to irritants, pollutants, and toxins can lead to asthmatic bronchitis especially if the person already has chronic bronchitis. The reason behind this is still unknown according to experts; but they claim that some environmental factors influence such condition.

Symptoms

-	wheezing
-	cough
-	difficulty breathing
-	chest discomfort
-	pain and soreness
-	increased infection vulnerability

Individuals suffering from asthma exhibit the same symptoms, but those that have asthmatic bronchitis experience them in higher intensities.

Treatment includes bronchodilators, antibiotics, and steroids. You must be warned that these treatments are not that effective in treating the causes of the disease. Inhaled medicines and bronchodilators provide only temporary amelioration to symptoms because the airways are cleared. Improvement can be seen after an ongoing treatment. 

Treatments

-	Oral corticosteroids like prednisolone tablets
-	Symptom controller like salmeterol
-	Oral antibiotics
-	Preventer-medication or anti-inflammatory like fluticasone
-	Reliever medications or bronchodilation like salbutamol

Doctors will advice patients with asthmatic bronchitis to avoid irritants like dust, pollen, smoke, alcohol vapors, and chemicals. Some patients are even required to have flu vaccines and the necessary precaution should be undertaken against bacterial or viral infections.

Any disease when not treated at an early stage has a great chance of developing into other forms of illnesses. Clinical examinations, pulmonary testing, and laboratory analyses can establish the asthmatic bronchitis diagnosis. Although bronchitis is a common condition, misdiagnosis can occur since respiratory illnesses are somewhat similar with each other. Other doctors might require supplementary respiration tests and chest x-ray to prescribe a treatment or medication.

People of all ages may suffer from asthmatic bronchitis. This is already a major complication that needs professional medial attention. Now, you're already susceptible to developing pneumonia.

If you want to heal permanently, you must first get an accurate diagnosis. Only then can you be given the appropriate medication and treatment. If you don’t want further complications to develop, then you'd better see your doctor. If you haven't been diagnosed yet and you think you have the symptoms mentioned above, then try to seek medical help.

Addressing any disease immediately can prevent complications, and not only that, you get to save money on medical costs. If you let your condition worsen, then you're bound to spend a huge amount of money in the future for medications alone.

So why wait before things get complicated? Act now and look for a doctor that can diagnose your condition. He or she is the best person to assess your condition and determine the right medication suited for you.
