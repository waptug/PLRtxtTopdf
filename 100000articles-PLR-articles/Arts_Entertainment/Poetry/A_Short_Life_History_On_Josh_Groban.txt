In Los Angeles, California on February 27, 1981, Josh Gorban was brought into the world. Six albums later, including the double-platinum selling self-titled Josh Groban in 2001 and Closer in 2003, and this singer has inspired millions around the world. 

Josh knew from early on what his calling was. He attended the Bridges Academy where he studied theatre classes. During his teenage years, he attended the Interlochen Arts Camp in Michigan where he majored in musical theater. The Interlochen Arts Camp is enjoys a worldwide reputation for excellence in educational, artistic and cultural programs. In this setting, Josh developed a love of the musical theater and began acting and singing in school productions. In addition to his normal class work, Josh began taking singing lessons on the side to develop his voice and style.

It was David Foster (winner of fourteen Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe and been nominated three times for an Academy Award for Best Song) that discovered Josh’s gift. Foster hired Groban to work as a rehearsal singer. At the 1999 Grammy Awards, Josh stood in for Andrea Bocelli and rehearsed Foster’s song “The Prayer” with pop icon and diva Celine Dion. Foster would continue to have influence over Josh’s career as his skill and style progressed.

Josh completed his High School education at the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts where he graduated in 1999 with a major in theater. He then attended the prestigious Carnegie Mellon University. Josh decided to end his educational pursuit after completing the first year when Warner Bros. Records offered him a recording contract through Foster. The presence that Josh’s voice carries led the first album to focus on more classical songs such as “Gira Con Me” and “Alle Luce Del Sole.” Foster and Josh deliberately chose these songs and considering that the album went multiple-platinum, it looks like a wise choice. 

With a combination of a firm educational background and carefully cultivated talent, Josh Groban has reached millions that call themselves “Grobanites.” In addition to enjoying his albums and many concert events, Grobanites have had the fortunate to see him on the hit television show Ally McBeal, on The Simpsons and he has preformed at numerous charity events like: VH1 Save the Music, Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope and David Foster and Friends Charity Gala. 

Unlike many in the music industry, Josh Groban has not taken part in much controversy. His interviews are typically limited to his music and little of his private life is discussed. He currently is unmarried and lives in Malibu, CA.
