Currency rates and the differential between countries and over time is the meat of the foreign exchange game. They are constantly changing and the better your ability to predict these changes the more money you are going to make over time in this market. So naturally a few tips in this area are worth their weight in gold.

So what are some of the things that should be learned when attempting to understand the changes in currency rates? What affects currency and the perception of their value up against the currency of any number of other countries? I make no guarantees in this article but hope to point you in a few worthwhile directions so that you can understand and therefore profit in this goldmine of a market.

Before I start I want to mention the potential for profit if you understand and are willing to put some time into mastering the factors involved in the changing currency rates. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is that thought this market has been around for a long time relatively few people are taking advantage of it. The market is not saturated and therefore there is a lot more room to compete and be at the top of the game. Why is this? For one thing it just has never been as flashy as the stock market. Part of this is how things have played out in the media and in our economy. Industry is for some reason valued more than the overall economy and the public’s perception of striking it rich is stronger in the stock market. It is true that the potential to strike instant riches is greater in the stock market with new companies forming and old ones failing far faster than countries are forming and failing. However the potential for constant and predictable gain is more in forex.

Why? Well for several reasons. One the currency rates, or in other words the value of a currency is dependent on something that is far easier to evaluate and predict. The chief operator in this game is the overall economy of that country, which is far more stable and predictable than the ability of a company to earn a profit in the cutthroat world of business. You can judge with far more accuracy how a current event or change in leadership is going to affect an economy globally than you can how a company will perform.

The main reason for this is the information differential that there is more information available on current events and the lives and values of governmental leaders than there are on private companies. This is due to the concentration of the media in this area and the fact that it is more important for a company to be private in order to not give an advantage to their competition.

So in order to be good in the currency rates game you have to read your newspaper and have a general idea of the public and global perception of an event and a government and how these things will affect the economy of a country. Something that we do almost every day anyway.
