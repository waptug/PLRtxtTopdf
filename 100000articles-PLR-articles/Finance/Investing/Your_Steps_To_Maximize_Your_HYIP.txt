Any investor wishes to make money in HYIP. Finding a successful high yield investment program is not enough to maximize your high yield investments. Certainly it is not easy to maximize your return on investment from best HYIP. The main point of this article is the strategies how to find “fruitful” and prosperous HYIP and to maximize your interests from this HYIP. 

Before we start to discuss the strategies, we should find an answer to the question what is best HYIP. Well, it is difficult to answer because there are various possibilities. For some investors the “fruitful” HYIP is HYIP with huge daily interest, for other HYIPers the “fruitful” HYIP is HYIP with instantly withdraw. Undoubtedly, all these investors are right.

I guess than each investor wishes the “fruitful” HYIP which is online for a long time, not just several weeks or a few months. Moreover, each investor wishes that “fruitful” HYIPs must have fast support. Some HYIPs reply to your questions within 1-2 days and, of course, it is too long! I am a potential investor and I need to get an answer immediately! 

Certainly, you can find many answers in FAQ section of a great number of HYIP web sites but sometimes you need information which you can not find there. If HYIP has phone support so it is very good, you can always phone them and get answers to your questions.

According to many experienced online investors, one of the most important things for the “fruitful” HYIP is fast withdraws. No one wants to wait 1 or 2 days till they receive payment. Certainly, everyone wants to get money within few hours. “Fruitful” HYIPs have to pay fast. 

All investors agree with me that HYIP security is significant in online investments. Of course, the “fruitful” and prosperous HYIP must have the server protection to guarantee that users' accounts are safe and secure. Real “fruitful” HYIPs spend a lot of money for hosting and advertising as well as Ddos protection and security.

If HYIP has Prolexic Ddos protection it is a really good sign of seriousness of this high yield investment program because according to online security data, Prolexic Ddos protection costs more than $2000 per month.

Daily interests are the subject of many hot discussions on online HYIP forums because investors have very different opinions. Some people prefer 10-20% daily and other like 1-2% daily. Undoubtedly, the prosperous HYIP invests money into Forex trading and to other contemporary industries. So if HYIP earn money in Forex they can not offer 10-20%. It is impossible and each investor knows that. 

Now the time is to discuss ways how to maximize your HYIP. After having found the “fruitful” and prosperous HYIP, the key to having successful investments is to build a safe, diversified portfolio and to extract your own money as quickly as possible. This will limit risk to your capital because if one programme closes, you will still have the others to fall back on.

Before investing in any programme, you should do a little research on it. I mean you should remember the main features of prosperous HYIP, namely daily interests of no more than 2-3%, excellent support, high qualified web site design of the HYIP company and best users' account protection.

Besides, HYIP scripts are easily to get a hold of and this makes it easier for fraudsters and scammers to operate. One of the things to look for is the programmer's reputation if they are paying consistently. 

When the investor makes any online investment, his aim is to extract his money as quickly as possible. This is because the investor wants to be able to invest using the profit he made from the high yield investment programme to protect his own capital. For example, a typical investment could be $100 then, after 30 days, the investor would extract his own money and re-invest the profits so that he is making risk that he uses “other people's money”.

Another meaningful thing is that the investor will need to make use of referral systems to explode his profits from his investments. This is when the investor recommends someone to the programme and receives commission for it. This usually creates residual income for the investor which means him the opportunity to invest more of “other people's money” to make even more cash.
