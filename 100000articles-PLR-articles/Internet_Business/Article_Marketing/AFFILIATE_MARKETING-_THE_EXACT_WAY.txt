An web affiliate marketing campaign is essentially a situation where other website owners place ads for your business on their websites. These website owners are known as affiliates. it is important to understand how this type of marketing works. In general the affiliates are given code for your banner ad to place on their website & given the freedom to promote their own website as they see fit. In promoting their website they are also attracting attention to your website because of the banner ad directing visitors to your own web-site. 

One of the most appealing elements of web affiliate marketing is the affiliate is only compensated when he produces a desired result. This means the home based online business owner is not obligated to pay the affiliate unless the affiliate is successful. Success may be defined as generating traffic to the website, resulting in a sale or even resulting in the web user registering on your website or filling out a survey.

The compensation for affiliates is generally based on cost per click, cost per lead or cost per sale. Cost per click & cost per lead are usually paid in terms of a flat fee which is awarded to the affiliate each time an web user either basically clicks through the banner ad on his website or performs a specific action after clicking through the ad. Cost per sale may result in the affiliate being awarded a flat fee or a percentage of the sale depending on the agreement between the business owner & the affiliate. 

The most effective use of web affiliate marketing is to actively seek out affiliate marketers with a proven track record of promoting the home based online businesses which they support. Most online web affiliate programs are open to someone with a website & it is not necessarily damaging to permit those who are not  knowledgeable about marketing to run your banner ad but it is far more worthwhile to seek out affiliates who are  adept & generating website traffic to their own web-site. This is important because the more visitors they receive each month the more likely your website it to receive interest from visitors who click on the affiliates banner ad. 

Another aspect of web affiliate marketing which can contribute to success or failure is the design of your banner ads. it is important to remember web affiliate marketing is viewed the same way other types of marketing are viewed & care should be taken to develop banner ads which will be appealing to your target audience. This means everything from the colors of your ad to the size & style of the font should be carefully considered to develop an appealing advertisement.
