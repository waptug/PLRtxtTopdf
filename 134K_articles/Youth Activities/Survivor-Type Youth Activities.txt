Survivor-Type Youth Activities

If you watch television often, then you probably know the different television programs which feature the survivor instinct of certain individuals. Did you know that by being a member of a youth group, you can do survivor-type youth activities?

A lot of teenagers want to be accepted in a group but sometimes, this is very hard to achieve. Adolescents go through a tough time because of the many changes in their lives. The society is sometimes too cruel and the troubled teenagers often find themselves involved in drugs, gambling, and excessive alcohol intake. If you don’t want to become one of them, you must find an active youth group in your locality. 

What can youth groups do for you? The youth groups are very helpful. By being a member of the group, you will be pre-occupied with the various group activities. You will not have time to fool around. Your parents will be very thankful if they find out that you’re a member of a youth group. 

Youth groups usually conduct monthly meetings. A good thing about youth groups is that they also focus mainly on God. The youth leaders encourage the group members to know God better. If the group is closer to God, then they can achieve all their goals. 

Some of the youth group activities include the following:

1. Community or public service; church services

2. Socializing skills; ethical lessons

3. Going to the movies, having dinners at restaurants

4. Camping during summer, winter, and spring; sleep-over; retreats

5. Survivor-type activities like hiking, water rafting, mountain climbing, cave exploring, etc.

The fifth set of activities are well-loved by the youth group members. It’s one way to test their survival skills. Some youths want to live on the wild side and so they really like to do outdoor activities. 

The group can go hiking in an out-of-town location. They can even do some mountain climbing after that. Hiking and mountain climbing are fun activities because they are nearer to nature. They can see many trees, plants, birds, and even animals. 

Cave exploring is another good activity. The youth leaders can organize a cave exploring activity. They can even stay for the night there so that group members will have more fun. They can even do some bonding activities so that the members will know each other better. 

While camping on a foreign place, the group can also go water rafting if the camp is near a river. This activity is fun and it really needs teamwork. This is an activity that builds teamwork. By the time the activities are finished, the group will know each other better. 

Survivor-type youth activities are somehow dangerous but of course, they have a staff who knows first-aid. Your parents need not worry a thing whenever you’re out doing the activities. The youth leaders will make sure that everything will go smoothly and safely. 

So what are you waiting for? Find a youth group near your place now and join. The group can provide you with the companionship that you need. The group members are excellent company. Your parents will even encourage you to actively participate in the various activities because it is for your own good.
