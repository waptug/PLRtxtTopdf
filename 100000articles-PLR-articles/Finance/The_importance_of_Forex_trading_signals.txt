Why are Forex trading signals important? After you are happy with your 'demo' account, you will want to start trading. However, the truth is that you would not have trained yourself properly in Forex trading. These services are offered by either brokers or professional traders or some market analysts through desktop or pager alerts, emails and SMS. They may provide additional automated alerts also, it is important to look at any extra features provided. You have to pay either a quarterly or monthly fee depending on the broker you choose. These fee may vary from one Forex signal service provider to another, however, they would range anywhere between $50 and $250.

It is always better to subscribe to these Forex trading signals as you need not spend time in monitoring the market for entry and exit points. However, it is also essential to analyze the track record of the Forex trading signal provider before subscribing, to ensure that the majority of the time, they were right, and the track record is reliable. 

One of the main advantages of using Forex trading signals is that you need not worry about analyzing the market. This is taken care of the Forex trading signal providers. They also tell you the entry and exit point by monitoring and analyzing the market. 

As I said, this is a paid service and in general, they offer Forex signal services to leading currency pairs like EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY. For some providers, you may have to pay an additional fee to get signal services for other currencies or pairs that are not used often or in other words, rare. Few providers will also provide you with the charts that they use for taking these market decisions.

Even though, Forex trading signals help you in minimizing risks or losses in Forex trading, it is vital that you have self-confidence that you can do good trading and can gain profits. Never do trading when you feel insecure. 

I would recommend subscribing to these Forex trading signal services at least till you have gained confidence in trading or if you do not have the time to monitor and analyze the market. It can help you develop your trading strategy as you observe how another, successful trader operates.

Happy trading!
