If you really enjoy spending your vacation 'on water' or would like to try something new and exciting for the first time, then you can consider a houseboat vacation. There are so many fun things to do and so many great landscapes to see on a houseboat vacation! 

But before making further plans, let's take a look at the options that you have for a low-cost vacation on water: you could rent a houseboat this year and try out an altogether exotic kind of vacation this year, or you could indulge in a houseboat timeshare. 

What is a houseboat timeshare? Most people who have used a houseboat timeshare say that it is a great way to spend your vacation at a very high-quality resort, in a place where you couldn't get reservations so easily that too at a very low price! Doesn’t that sound great? But let's see how and why houseboat timeshares can offer you with such fabulous opportunities of low-cost vacationing on water.
 
Initially the concept of timeshare appeared somewhere in the 1960's in France. The principle of a timeshare actually marketed the concept of 'buying the hotel' for vacationing. Indeed, timeshare is a form of real estate ownership, more precisely vacation property ownership. The owners divide the costs of running the resort and also the use of the place between themselves. This timeshare concept was first applied to land-resorts, but nowadays, we have all kinds of vacation properties, including houseboats. 

Houseboat timeshare works on a very simple principle. All 52 weeks of the year are divided between the owners (usually there are 51, considering that one week should remain for maintenance)! So they can own the resort on a 1/51 basis and can use the resort one week per year. 

Of course, one can buy as many houseboat timeshares as he/she wants to. But maybe you neither have the budget to do that nor the time. And spending your vacation in the same spot every year doesn't seem to be such an exciting idea too! Therefore, several companies have been founded who promote the idea of exchanging timeshares. 

Thus being a timeshare owner helps you avail the opportunity to exchange the existing timeshare with someone else to a more pleasant vacation on a different spot for a very small fee. And so, with the houseboat timeshare you could spend less for a vacation that in other conditions would end up costing you quite a fortune.
There are many companies out there that deal in timeshare and exchanging. Several of them deal with all types of vacation property ownership, like land resorts, houseboat timesharing or even motor homes, yachts and campgrounds.

If you want to consider houseboat timeshares for a low-cost vacation on water but don't know if you will really like the concept, then I would recommend that you go to one of the exchange companies and try to get a vacation timeshare for a week. These companies have special offers for non-timeshare-owners. In this way, you can check out what you'll be 'owning' and see if it suits you or not. And of course, you can make a comparison between renting and houseboat timeshare when it comes to the question of your budget. In this way you'll be able to assess if it is more convenient for you to rent or to pay the company's fee and the maintenance fee for a houseboat timeshare. 

Whatever be your choice, don’t forget to enjoy your low-cost vacation on water to the fullest!
