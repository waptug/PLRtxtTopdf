For four whole model years, the Lincoln Mark VI lived fully. It was in production starting from the year 1980. Its time to shine on the roads and on the streets was cut short come 1983. The Lincoln Mark VI has been made available in two body styles that comprise of a coupe and a sedan. The coupe held two doors while on the other hand, the sedan held two doors more. The power source for this vehicle was a choice between two capable engines which were the 5.0 liter V8 engine and the 5.9 liter V8 engine. The Lincoln Mark VI was considered to be a part of the whole Lincoln Mark line of vehicles from the Ford Motor Company’s luxurious Lincoln division. In truth, this vehicle is more or less a carryover or a reskinned Lincoln Mark V. 

Upon the introduction of the Lincoln Mark VI, the vehicle contained only very few changes as compared to its predecessor which was the Lincoln Mark V. In fact, most people noticed that the changes were only small and minor revisions in the design and style. Although people also noticed that the Lincoln Mark VI was crafted and manufactured to be slightly smaller than the vehicle which came before it. The most noticeable among all minor changes were the new headlight covers that the Lincoln Mark VI sported around. The vehicle also was a proud owner of a new steering wheel design. The hallmark opera windows that the Lincoln Mark V had were still continued in the Lincoln Mark VI. Along with these windows were the grille that held a Rolls Royce styling and design; and also the rear tire hump. 

The changes made the Lincoln Mark VI look kind of awkward provide not much appeal, and thus it held not much appeal. However, this kind of styling and design has made Lincoln think of a project that would bring the vehicle in the limelight. What it did was it asked four designers to individually design and style a Lincoln Mark VI their way. This brought about popularity to the car. And along with that popularity came the reputation of being one of the most sought after vehicles for vehicle and car collectors.
