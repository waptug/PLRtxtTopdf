Did you know that any desk top pad can do wonders in adding a touch of style to your office desk? This is true as long as you choose the best match for your office style. There are many variations of desk pads on the market to choose from. Fortunately, there are only a few simple guidelines you can follow in order to ensure the best choice for your budget, your ideal office design and other particular features you may want in your desk pad.

First of all, use of a writing pad will take away all concerns related to damaging the desk top surface by imprints from pen marks. Of course, having a perfectly flat surface for writing is a very basic requirement for any office. Writing pads that fill these requirements are numerous and can come in a variety of styles and materials, from leather writing pads to paper or cardboard based desk pads. Remember that paper based pads are easily damaged by spills or constant abrasion, so they will probably need replacement after a short while.

In addition to providing a safe, protective writing surface, desk top pads also help your flow of paper work by providing a non-slip surface for your work. Selection of a pad that provides some resistance to sliding of papers and folders is recommended, especially for busy offices. If you have ever tried to organize papers on a smooth, slick surface, you will understand the benefit a slightly resistive surface can offer.

Desk pads can also help work wonders on office and desk area clutter, helping to enhance your work productivity and making you more relaxed throughout the work day. Some say the organization is the key to business success, and desk top pads are an ideal tool to contribute in achieving that. You can use executive desk pads for many organizational things, such as:

- organizing your business documents, phone numbers;
- make a special place for important business cards;
- get your writing instruments in one place;
- organize your tasks with a daily agenda which can be included in the desk pad;
- Organize brief notes or instructions that you find useful in your business activity.

Using desk pads as a focal point to assist in decluttering makes the process much easier. As above, considering the quality of the surface, the protective nature of the material and the ability of the desk pad to act as a focal point for organizaiton of your space are the key considerations in making a good selection. No matter what your ultimate choice is, from a leather surface to acrylic or a high-tech Rhinolyn desk pad, it can provide writing comfort as well as provide an anchor point in your office space to help in organizing and decluttering your desk.
