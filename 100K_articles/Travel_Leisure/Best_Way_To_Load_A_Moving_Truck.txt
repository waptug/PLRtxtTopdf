When families pack up their belongings and venture to another city to start a new life, they almost always use a moving truck. Loading these moving trucks is not as easy as tossing your belongings into the back. In fact, there are ways to properly and efficiently load a moving truck. You have to follow certain safety guidelines which are very important when moving out since some loads may weight tons and if they are not properly secured, it may shift dangerously while the truck is moving. Plus there are some laws concerning moving trucks that need to be followed in order to avoid being fined.

To start with, you should become familiar with the weight and capacity of your moving truck and take note of the weight of the items that you will be transporting. Each moving truck has weight restrictions; you should stay within your truck’s weight restrictions and never push it above the limit. And if something is wrong with truck, have it fixed properly and immediately to ensure safety not only of the things that are going to be transported but also for your own safety.

Loading and unloading equipment by driving it on and off a cab often times create apprehension; it is usually preferable to use a long, wide ramp when loading equipment and furniture on moving trucks. This also makes it easier for loaders in loading large furniture. The angle of the ramp is critical when loading, try positioning the ramp so that it is not too steep and in such a way to minimize the amount of pressure on the loaders.

It is also advised to put some supporters under the cab’s edge or under the ramps to prevent up and down movement of the trailer especially when loading equipment or furniture. Incorrect positioning of the loads has a negative effect on how the truck drives and handles, especially on curves and turns. It is best to place the load in between the cab and the rear axle, placing the load behind the rear axle can produce poor handling of the moving truck. This also distributes some of the produced weight to the rear of the moving truck through out the journey, otherwise the cab will seem to have a mind of its own, and the cab will probably wobble or swerve.

Another important thing to remember before loading a moving truck is to have the tires checked. Tires are considered to be one of the most ignored areas of vehicle safety and should definitely be included during all of the safety inspections prior to loading. The tires are rated for a specific weight and yet most people are not aware of this. The best way for you to know about the tire’s weight rating is to look at the sidewall of the tire; and if you could not read it, then it is most probably time for you to change your vehicle’s tires. Heavy-duty tires which are sold by tire distributors and dealers are mostly available with many different weight carrying capabilities, you may also ask for assistance in determining the tire’s loading capacity.

Make sure to secure your loads firmly, pack the truck properly, and you will be sure to drive smoothly and safely even on rough roads.
