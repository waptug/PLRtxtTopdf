One popular technique for debt management is consolidation of all debts into one debt. For the consolidation, the borrower takes a loan at lower interest rate and pays off previous debts immediately.

All you do is make a combined payment of your different monthly installments to the debt management company.

A debt management company will also do all the calculations for you to make out how much of payments you have to make towards creditors. So debt management is only a service and should not be mistaken for elimination of debts. You still hold those debts intact despite the debt management service availed.
