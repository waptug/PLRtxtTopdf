Boating Instruction


When you decide to take up boating as a hobby, it’s important to get boating instruction from a competent professional who can teach you all about this great sport.  Boating instruction entails much more than just showing you how to operate a boat.  It also encompasses boating safety along with boat and engine maintenance.

When you receive boating instruction, you’ll be learning about boating as a sport, but it will do so much more for you.  It can make boating much more enjoyable, make you more skilled as a captain, and can even save you money!  Getting boating instruction through certified classes could provide you with a discount on your boating insurance!

There are many places where you can find reputable boating instruction.  Start with a local marina.  Like a golf pro shop, the marina will have a “boat pro” on staff that will be happy to help you with your boating education.  Many marinas have classes you can take on site that will teach you everything you need to know.

We live in an Internet world.  It just goes to say, then, that there is boating instruction available online.  This is a great way to be able to study all aspects of boating from the comfort of your own home.  However, keep in mind that you won’t have the benefit of a live person to ask questions of.

What should you look for in choose a boating instruction class?  Here are a few of the components that the class should include:

* Certified instructors with proper qualifications
* Boat operation
* Boat mechanics and maintenance
* Boating safety
* Navigation rules
* Coast Guard requirements for safe boats
* Proper seamanship

Another great advantage to taking a boating instruction course is that it will help to qualify you for your boating license.  Like getting a driver’s license, you will have to take a test to obtain your boat license.  Having the advantage of a class that can teach you what you need to know will prepare you in the best way possible.

Boating instruction will also tell you how to register your boat, best ways to store your boat, and how to ramp your boat – all things that the responsible skipper should know well.  You can also get the best information on proper boat maintenance as well as basic engine repair.

When you decide to captain your own vessel, boating instruction is a big part of becoming a responsible skipper.  Get as much as you can as often as you can – even if you are an experienced boater.  It never hurts to have a refresher course along the way.  Boating instruction is your way of telling everyone “I know what I’m doing, and you can trust me!”
