I never really see that many pairs of plus size jeans out there when I am shopping.  However I see women wearing plus size jeans.  I have to say this has always confused me and made me wonder where these people shop.  I mean I see the small plus size sections in the department stores but they aren’t exactly over run with plus size jeans; to be honest al lot of the stuff I see in those sections is spandex, as stereotypical as that sounds.  Actually I believe most of the plus size jeans I have seen are spandex.  

The plus size jeans I seen on women around the city are for the most part fairly trendy, which is more than I can say for a lot of the plus size clothing I see floating around out there and this aroused my curiosity even more.  Do to this curiosity about the location of these plus size jean sources, I looked for some on the internet and it appears there are actually a lot of resources there.  However I have always been a little skeptical abut ordering jeans and clothing over the internet.  It makes me nervous to order something without knowing what it is going to look like when it is on.  I know you can return most of these items but with the mail, and the shipping, and the refunds, it just seems like more of a hassle than it is worth.  However maybe this is a huge resource I have been missing out on.

Maybe a lot of this shopping that has been going on in the plus size jean market is happening online; I sure don’t see the stores in the mall.  However I will admit it is not something I have looked into extensively but have only noticed in passing, there is a good possibility I am failing to notice the true source of the industry.
