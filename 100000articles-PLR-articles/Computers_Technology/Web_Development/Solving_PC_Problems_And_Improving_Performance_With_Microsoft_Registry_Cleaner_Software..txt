Are you experiencing the following pc problems: getting system errors on startup or while using your pc, random crashes or general sluggish pc performance. These are common problems caused by Windows registry inconsistencies. Microsoft registry cleaner software can fix these problems and make your pc running smoothly again. The other option is to format your hard disk and reinstall the operating system and all the programs you installed over time.

What is the registry? Well the windows operating system stores crucial information about your computer in a database file. In this database it stores information about your hardware, software and settings you made to this software and hardware. This data is crucial to keep your pc running smoothly. All the changes which are made to the pc are stored as keys in the registry. From the moment you start the Windows operating system it will read and add registry settings about your hardware and software. Each time software is installed or uninstalled entries are changed or removed.

Unfortunately these entries in the registry are not removed properly causing problems in performance or failures like system errors. Each time you add or remove hardware and/or software to the system, the registry increases in size and it takes more time for Windows to read the registry causing performance problems. With registry cleaning software you can successfully purge these entries from the registry getting better performance and a smooth running pc.

By using Windows registry cleaner software you can solve these problems. There are many free registry cleaning tools available for download on the internet. You can download one of these programs which matches the version of the Windows operating system you are using. Most of these registry cleaners offer the option to make a backup of your current registry in case you encounter any problems after the cleanup. Another option most offer is an automated scan of your registry at boot time or at a predefined date or time interval. If you are not using this option I would recommend that you run the software each time when you have uninstalled several programs or at least once a month. Another recommended option that most programs offer is to defragment of compress the registry. This will make the file smaller and thus it will be faster for Windows to read the registry for values it's looking for.
