Article Body:
It wasn't all that long ago that launching an Internet business meant navigating a maze of technical intricacies. Once you came up with an idea that you thought would make money, you then had to hire a Web designer, a website programmer, and most likely another programmer who specialized in e-commerce solutions. You also had to have an extensive knowledge of the inner workings of the business world and understand, for example, what you need in order to open a merchant account to accept credit cards. Then there was the hassle of dealing with customer service issues, dealing with technical issues regarding your website, and so on. Before you knew it, your big plans to get rich went by the wayside, and instead you found yourself in debt. 

Thanks to advances in technology - and to the know-how of those who understand those advances - a money making business is within reach virtually anyone who can type their email address. That's because there are now fully automated systems that provide people with the means to create their own home business. 

If that sounds too good to be true, think again. After all, sites like YouTube have enabled any website owner to embed video into his or her site - without having to know the first thing about video streaming, formatting, or storage. It makes sense, then, that industrious entrepreneurs have created fully automated systems that enable you to launch your own Internet business without having to write or upload HTML code, set up a payment gateway, deliver products, or engage in site administration issues. 

How do they do this? Essentially, they create a single website that has several products available, and then assign a referral code to every business owner. The new business owner simply substitutes his or her own PayPal account (tracked via his or her email address) for that of the website's original owner. In that way, the new owner receives all of the revenue from sales associated with his or her referral code. 

These new technologies not only provide a unique home working opportunity, but they also surface in some of the hottest products being offered today. So many people are in the market for information products that it's mind-boggling. For example, software, scripts, audio and video development, e-books, graphics, and website content are all in great demand. From the business owner's perspective, these products are ideal because they can be delivered digitally. Because the buyer can download these products, there is no inventory to track and no shipping hassles. 

Even those who are not tech-savvy can easily participate in this Internet business revolution. Because this type of home working opportunity is fully automated, it doesn't require any specialized knowledge. It doesn't require special training seminars or ongoing fees for maintenance. In truth, all it requires is the recognition that these products are in high demand and the desire to capitalize on that demand.
