Red Canyon Lodge

Just outside Parowan, Utah, is a tiny, yet spectacular bed and breakfast, the Red Canyon Lodge. They are situated just minutes north of Cedar City at the foundation of Brian Head outside the town of Parowan and sit at six thousand feet in elevation, in a gorgeous basin bordered by the Beaver Mountains to the north and Brian Head Mountain to the east.

Red Canyon Lodge provides the amenities of now with the ambiances of an old fashioned western Log Lodge. The accommodations all contain personal Jacuzzi baths with shower and are warmed with forced air radiant heating. All rooms have a great picture window with breathtaking view.

The Red Canyon Lodge has a Great Room that boasts a huge two-story masonry fireplace, which you can sit by and take pleasure in.  You can withdraw to the library up in the loft area, which is just the thing for reading, playing board games and puzzles or just sitting and enjoying the panoramic view.

Each morning between 8:30-9:30 am you will take pleasure in an entire country breakfast and in the afternoons complimentary beverages and appetizers are served in the roomy dining area. Visit the Great Room and unwind after your day of visiting the conveniently located Southern Utah State and National parks and monuments, nationally renowned Tony Award winning Shakespeare Theater or the Neil Simon Festival or enjoy many events going on throughout the year in nearby towns.

There is always something going on in the local area, including a nearby ski resort you can visit for the day.  The limited size of the Red Canyon Lodge makes it feel like you are home, without the work that comes with being there. Visit for the local activities or to get away from it all.  Whatever the reason, you won't be disappointed.
