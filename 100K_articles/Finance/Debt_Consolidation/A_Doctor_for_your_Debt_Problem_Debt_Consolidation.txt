Debt is just as a quicksand, in which getting in is easier than getting out of it. Once the person is in the trap of debts,he gets in deeper and deeper. Then he only finds his life boat in the form of debt consolidation.

Debt consolidation refers to settlement of the debts of a person through a single manageable loan. In short, we can say that debt consolidation provides a help in avoiding the bankruptcy. It puts an end to the harassing calls made by the creditors regarding the payment of pending bills and debts. It also lowers the monthly payment which in turn enables the person to save a certain sum of money.

Debt consolidation is like a doctor to the debt problem. And it offers a fresh start to the debtor and also helps in attaining a more healthy financial position.

Whatever your debt problem may be, whether the personal debts or business debts or your credit card debts, you are only required to avail any debt management plan or program in order to get rid of your debts. Before going for any debt consolidation program the person must take advice from the professional credit counsellor. The credit cousellor will listen and analyse your problem. And then he will suggest you the best solution to your problem; that is, which debt management program to avail.

Basically, these debt management programs try to reduce your monthly payments by way of reducing or freezing the interest on the loan. This will in turn help the person to eliminate the debts within few months.
A person can consolidate his debts by three ways:- debt consolidation loan, debt consolidation mortgage and debt consolidation remortgage. However, there are other ways also to consolidate the debts, such as Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVA’s).but these are considered as the bad credit for a person.

A debt consolidation loan can be reffered as managing the debts by consolidating them. It lets you deal wth the single lender rather than dealing with the numerous creditors. On the other hand, debt consolidation mortgage refers to getting a loan on the basis of the equity in the house and paying back to its creditors against the debts. And, debt remortgage can be termed as extention of mortgage. It is the term of mortage which is usually negotiated to include the increase in the amount borrowed.

Above mentioned three ways of consolidating the debts do not necessarily mean that they  suits everyone. They are merely an option for solving the debt problem. And it is upto the debtor which way he chooses to consolidate his debts. Debtors must choose the alternative which suits him the best, with regard to his financial situation.
