The realization about the need to prepare for safeguarding crucial data on your hard disk may come a little too late when the computer or the hard disk has crashed. Data loss could mean, for a small business, going out of business unfortunately, sometimes permanently. Rebuilding years of data is out of question. It is pertinent to know the whys and hows of data loss in order to understand data recovery better.

Important Causes of Data Loss
What you hoped will not occur, perhaps because of no reason, could always hit you hardest unless you are safeguarded against them. Computer running slowly could be because of spyware scrupulously installed could be working behind screens to destroy or transmit data to their masters eventually causing hard disk to crash. Others like electric storms, power surges, mechanical failures, fires & floods and user errors (sometimes in disregard of warnings) could affect your computer without any or sufficient warning.

You could also loose data because of sudden but unintended deleting of files or programs. Accidental disk format, virus attack, partition loss are some more causes for data loss.

Data Protection
Data protection is the best policy than ruing over the loss. You can make use of trusted data backup software which automatically backup your data regularly, if you can’t do it yourself manually. Keeping backup of backups will safeguard you against the worst eventualities, too. Turn off your computer immediately as you hear strange noises like creaking run of hard disk. It is also wise to unplug power cords, modem and telephone cables when you are going out of home or office for a long time.

Data Recovery
The first thing you need to understand when dealing with data recovery is not loosing cool. Never act in haste and don’t attempt data recovery yourself unless you are an old hat at that. Call for professional help from your area and who you know.

Data recovery software does a neat job in most of the cases. There are quite a few reliable softwares available, no matter what platform your computer operates on. Data recovery softwares are available for Mac, Windows, Linux, and so on. Don’t attempt to use the software yourself out of gut feeling. If you must, check for user friendly personal packages.

An average company in US alone spends anywhere between $100,000 and $1 million in total for desktop-oriented disasters. This should more than emphasize the need for data safety and disk recovery.
