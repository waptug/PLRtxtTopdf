Positive Praise for your Child's Pride  
Praising a child correctly is important to the development of positive behaviors. It's a great way to encourage constructive future behavior. When you give praise you are giving your child a feeling of positive feedback, which increases their sense of confidence, self esteem and abilities.  When you praise your child, you are pointing out the way they've acted, an action they've taken, or simply who they are. When your child looks good, tell him so. When your child does anything that pleases you, let him know. You should also praise a child's effort to do well, even if it doesn't come out so good in the end. You should find something each day about your child to praise. 
Be on the lookout constantly for behaviors or actions deserving of praise, but don't be over the top about it.  Be sincere and honest in your praise. Wait for unexpected or previously unnoticed good behavior and praise your child for it.  And when you see such action or behaviors, praise immediately so the child will know exactly what behavior or action was deemed praiseworthy. It's also very important to look your child square in the eye when you praise him, and reinforce the positive behavior, action or trait being praised with a gesture such as a warm smile, a hug, scruff of the hair, or caress his face while you tell him. 
Be exact, and state precisely what action, behavior or trait you find praiseworthy.  And most importantly, never directly follow praise with criticism or negative comments.  Let your child know what they did right and reward them for it before you let them know what they did wrong and punish for misbehaving or a misdeed. 
So be sure to admire and congratulate your child and celebrate the good person they are growing into by praising their positive actions, behaviors and traits daily.  You'll be building a strong sense of self in your child and you'll grow closer as a result.
