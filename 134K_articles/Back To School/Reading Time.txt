Reading Time

	It’s time to go back to school.  If your kids haven’t been reading over the summer, now is a great time to get them started again.  Not all kids like to read but it is so important during school years.  Here are some ideas to make reading more fun.
	Start an incentive for your kids based on reading time or number of pages read.  After they reach their goal, take them to get ice cream or some other treat.
	Find a variety of reading materials for your children.  Introduce them to different genres to teach them about different kinds of reading available.  They can try reading a mystery, and then non-fiction book.  Science fiction and adventure books are really popular with boys.  Girls like books that they can relate to.  Find books that are appropriate to their age level.  And don’t forget the little kids.  Reading to them will help them appreciate reading as they get older.
	Children that don’t like to read can still find things they enjoy reading about.  There are magazines available for every topic.  You can find something on their favorite subject that they can read.  If your child wants to be a pilot when they grow up, find books on flying and building airplanes.  Finding something that is interesting will help inspire them to continue reading.
	Reading builds a foundation for learning that will follow your children throughout their lives.  It is such an important skill to have and is necessary for school.  Teaching your children good reading skills also allows them discipline for other studies.  It helps with concentration and comprehension.
	Successful reading skills will help your children become better at school.  And we all want that, right?
