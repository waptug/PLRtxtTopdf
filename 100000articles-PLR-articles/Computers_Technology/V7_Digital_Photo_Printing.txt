Photographs are a way of preserving a moment in our lives for the rest of our lives. Many of us have at least been tempted at the flashy array of photo printers which seemingly leap off the shelves at even the least tech-savvy. It surely seems old fashioned to talk about 35mm film and non-digital cameras in today’s day and age. To our children, cameras not so feature rich with LCD screens and built in Wi-Fi is as foreign as Atari. However, the innovation of home photo printing is bringing about a new way of preserving our most precious memories. Not only do we have digital copies to keep with us for the rest of our days across hundreds of different archives, thanks to printer manufacturers such as Epson, Hewlett Packard, and Canon, we now have the ability to fill our photo albums, right from the comfort of our living rooms.

 Whether it is Hewlett Packard with the award winning Photosmart 8250, Canon, with the sleek and stylish Selphy DS810, or Epson’s PictureMate Express Edition, it seems everyone wants a slice of the home photo printing pie. Behind the looks, style, and hype of these printers are the facts. For example, Hewlett Packard’s Photosmart 8250 has become a legend in its own right for its amazing ability to print a 4” x 6” photograph in only 14 seconds. The Canon Selphy falls far short of Hewlett Packard’s mark, ringing in at 63 seconds for a 4” x 6” print. Falling even farther behind the pack is the Epson PictureMate Express Edition, although stylish, and easy to carry with convenient handle, there is nothing so convenient about having to wait a whopping 1 minute and 20 seconds to get a single 4” x 6” print. The Canon and Epson models don’t fall completely short of Hewlett Packard’s newest pride and joy, however. Both the Canon Selphy DS810 and Epson’s PictureMate Express Edition trounce the Hewlett Packard in portability. The Selphy 810 is the smallest form factor, measuring in at only 8.7" (W) x 3.9"(H) x 8.7" (D). The PictureMate Express Edition is portable enough to be designed with a sleek handle to care with while taking those long road trips or a simple picnic in the park. For added portability, the PictureMate Express Edition even has a car adapter so the printer can be used virtually anywhere. These features veritably slaughter Hewlett Packard’s Photosmart 8250 where portability is an issue.

 All ringing in around the same price, (Hewlett Packard Photosmart 8250 $179.99 MSRP, Canon Selphy DS810 $149.99 MSRP, and Epson PictureMate Express Edition $149.99) Hewlett Packard’s leadership and innovation in the field has brought them to the top of the list. Having won several awards over the span of many years, including an Editor’s Choice award in PC Magazine for the Photosmart 8250 model, Hewlett Packard seems to be the name to beat and the way to go for any photographic entrepreneur who wants the most bang for his or her buck.
