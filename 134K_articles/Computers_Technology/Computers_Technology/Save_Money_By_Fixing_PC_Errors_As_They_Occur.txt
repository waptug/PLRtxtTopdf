How much did it cost you the last time you had to call one of those computer tech help lines? What about the time you actually had to have a PC service technician come to your home? That expensive, huh? The truth is, PC tech help is expensive, and often the problems that cost you the most could have been avoided for a fraction of the cost with just an ounce of prevention. 

There are many computer errors that send us scrambling for tech help. Sometimes, they can be annoying problems like glitches and error pop-up warnings. Other times, they can be fatal and result in the loss of data and/or system crash. All of these errors, no matter how varied they may be, have one thing in common: They are caused by things you unknowingly bring or take out of your system’s hard drive, and you can fix them instantaneously before they start to cause problems with the right software. 

You see, your computer is just a machine that does exactly what it is programmed to do or what you tell it to do. To help it do this, it has thousands of files and programs filed neatly away in the hard drive. Most of the time, these files are accessed by your computer easily, but sometimes the filing system can be a little off, which makes it hard for your PC to access certain files and applications quickly or at all. Anytime that your PC has to search for these files or fails to find them an error occurs. 

In most cases, errors can occur without you even realizing it. You may not get a warning or program shutdown. Often, the only evidence that you have that errors are occurring is a computer that does not perform as quickly as it used to. While this in itself is annoying and frustrating, hidden errors can multiply and result in PC problems that leave you shelling out big bucks to tech professionals. 

To avoid errors from multiplying and eating away at your wallet, you need to fix the little errors as they occur. This can be done easily with the right software. The right software consists of programs that watch out for hidden errors and help fix them before they cause problems. In many cases, you can get all of the protection from hidden errors that you need in one software suite or download. In some cases, you can even get an error scan for free. 

Even if you don’t think your PC has hidden errors on it, it may be a good idea to have it scanned for free just to make sure. Statistics show that it is not uncommon for most computers in operation to have more than 200 errors. In fact, 94% of all PCs that have been used for one month or longer have hidden errors. 

As mentioned before, hidden errors occur during the daily operation of your PC, and they especially occur when you download new programs or install and uninstall software. This is because each time you download a new program or install/uninstall software, you change the filing order of your hard drive. New files are added, old files are deleted, and some files that should have been deleted remain behind. In some cases, you may inadvertently delete a file that is needed for another computer application. All of these changes leave holes in your PC’s operation and make it more and more difficult for it to perform accurately and quickly. 

Instead of letting these problems add up until they become annoying, unbearable or result in a system crash, doctor software helps to eliminate any trouble that you may experience from hidden errors. This software fixes errors that cause problems, fixes corrupt files, prevents hidden files from causing harm, and helps you avoid formatting and rebooting errors without you having to think about it. 

And you can use this software for a fraction of the cost that you would shell out to tech professionals. Unlimited access to repairs costs as little as $20 per month, $60 per year and $130 for life. Now, that’s a big difference than what you pay for in-house technical service. In fact, you could pay for your doctor software for a lifetime just by avoiding one in-home technical call. All of those technical fees avoided equal more money in your pocket and a smooth-running, error-free personal computer for you and your whole family to enjoy.
