Article Body:
The hottest event in Colorado this summer… guaranteed.  This is a free event in which chili chefs compete for the state title and the opportunity to represent the Rocky Mountain region in the World Chili Cook-off.  Prizes will be awarded for best-costumed chef, best red chili, best green chili and best salsa.  And yes, samples will be available to the general public after the judging begins.

The event is held at the base of Winter Park Resort where you can find a 600 mile hiking and mountain biking trail system that spreads throughout the beautiful Fraser Valley.  Winter Park is also home of the longest Alpine Slide in Colorado!  A 3000 foot long slide, with a 600 foot drop winding through the wilderness. Take a chair lift to the top of Winter Park Mountain and you can find an 18 hole disc golf course. At 10,000 feet you will have some of the best views Colorado has to offer.  Back at the base there is also a miniature golf course that takes you through Fraser Valley history, a climbing wall, Rock N' Roll Gyro, Human Maze, Leaps & Bounds Bungee and a whole lot more.

Proceeds of this event will benefit the National Sports Center for the Disabled, which is one of the most important organizations found at Winter Park Resort.  It is also sponsored by Coors and Coors Light.
