Philip Reed, the Consumer Advice editor for Edmunds.com, explains, “There is an important distinction: a factory-certified vehicle is backed by the manufacturer and provides consumers with the option of servicing their vehicle at any of the franchise’s dealerships. We do not recommend dealer-certified cars because they typically offer a much more limited certification and no backing from the manufacturer.”

If you are one of those people looking forward to own a CPO vehicle, it is essential that you bring with you some tips on how to look for the best kind of CPO car.
