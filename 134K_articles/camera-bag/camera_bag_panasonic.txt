Camera bags are very important. It can keep your photography equipments safe wherever you go. Nevertheless, it should be of normal weight and comfortable to carry. A very simple way to find the right one is to carry your gear in a camera store and put it on your desired camera bag.

But it does not end there. You also need to examine the materials used in manufacturing it. Maybe you are familiar with the bag padding technology which was first based on using cotton batting which surrounds cardboard sheets. But now it was improved using foams and new plastics to make it lighter and much better. The layers should be carefully checked whether it is waterproof, a cardboard that absorbs water, or a closed-cell long-lasting foam. The linings should never interfere with the opening and closing of the bag and it should be easily dried out when it gets wet. 

If you are an adventurous photographer, then you better watch out for its construction. It should be closely and doubly stitched using durable thread, and provide reinforcement. You don't want your gear to get messed up or crushed down when your camera bag straps has been broken under a strain due to poor stitching.  

The internal and external details of the camera bags must never be taken for granted. The fabric on the sides and its dividers should have the same material. It must be soft enough to protect your camera and its lenses. The bag must contain sufficient padding and sturdy dividers. The external fabric is durable and resistant, cordura or denier is more preferred, seams are also sewn throughout the way, pockets are very accessible, straps are adequately stitched, and it provides space for additional straps. 

Both the interior and exterior systems of your camera bag should have maximum flexibility. The innards can be interchanged or removed to adjust onto your required needs. It should grow along with your interests as a photographer. 

Zippers are easy to open and accessible. This is very important for photographers when concentrating on their camera while accessing other accessories on their bags. Clasps are made up of either metal or plastic but it should withstand heavy use. 

The final decision is yours. There are numerous camera bags that will perfectly fit your Panasonic camera. The selection can be overwhelming, and like shoes, you will perhaps own several camera bags before finding what you really wanted. Make sure that you go for tested brands to avoid regrets in the end.
