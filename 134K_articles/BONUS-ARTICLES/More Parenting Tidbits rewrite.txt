More Tips For Parenting


* Diapers:  Most babies that are fed using the PDF method usually need a diaper change at each feeding time.  This means that your baby will need about 6-8 diapers a day or more.  Many new parents time the diaper changes with the after dinner bowel movement, but if you miss it, you will just have a few more diapers to change during the day.  

* Diaper rash:  Sensitive skin is a common problem for some babies and they may get a diaper rash due to a food allergy, yeast infection, sitting too long in a wet or messy diaper, or teething.  If you notice your baby beginning to get a diaper rash, talk to your pediatrician about which diaper rash medicine will work for your baby.  

* Growth spurts:  Growth spurts can start as early as 10 days after your baby’s birth.  Growth spurts usually are preceded by a sleepy, lethargic day and a big jump in appetite.  Growth spurts may happen again at 3, 6, and 12 weeks and again at 4 and 6 months.  If you begin to notice that your child is not as satisfied with the amount that you have been feeding her previously, then she may be beginning a growth spurt period.  If you are breastfeeding, you may want to add a feeding or two to satiate your baby’s appetite and to help increase milk production.  

* Immunizations:  With all of the conflicting reports on immunizations, you may be unsure about whether or not you want your child to receive immunizations.  I think that there are simply too many fatal diseases that can be prevented by immunizing your baby to take the chance.  If you are unsure, then you need to talk with your pediatrician, but understand that the reason that the infant mortality rate is so low in this country is because immunizations are routinely done.  

* Pacifiers & thumb sucking:  If you breastfeed, do not allow your child to use you as their pacifier.  If your baby seems to have a need to suck beyond eating, then you need to give them a pacifier.  There is no “nipple confusion” between a breast nipple and a pacifier as they are very different in feel and taste.  Babies will know the difference between the two.  Some children do not want a pacifier but will suck on their thumb.  If you don’t have a problem with it, then let them.  


* Spitting up:  It is very common for babies to spit up, but some babies do it more than others.  If your baby is growing normally, then there is no need to worry about it.  Projectile throwing up is not the same as spitting up.  Projectile throwing up is a violent reaction to reject the contents of the stomach and not just “burping” up a little milk.  If your baby does this frequently, consult your pediatrician.
