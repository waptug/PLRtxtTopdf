Our first of the cheap Les Paul guitars is the Epiphone Ultra electric guitar. The Ultra looks similiar to the Les Paul Standard, but to make it more "acoustic" sounding, its mahogany body has logically placed hollow cavities making it around 5.5 pounds lighter. It's very comfortable to play this guitar due to its belly contour on the back.

Next is the Epiphone Les Paul Special II electric guitar. This guitar is cheaply priced and provides a classic humbucker sound. The neck is a nice mahogany, and the fingerboard is rosewood with dot inlays. The hardware is chrome, plus it has tone and volume controls.

Our final affordable guitar under $500 is the Epiphone Les Paul 100 electric guitar. This instrument has two humbucker pickups, a fretboard of rosewood with a bolt-on mahogany neck, plus outstanding body wood. All this gives it one of the best sustaining tone characters. If you want to let your leads sing, try the Les Paul 100.
