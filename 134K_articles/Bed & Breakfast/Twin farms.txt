Twin farms

The New England states offer many fine bed and breakfast establishments.  One of the finest can be found in Woodstock, Vermont - Twin Farms.  

This 1795 country inn, set on three hundred acres of gardens, forests and meadows, offers guests a restful retreat from their busy lives.  Rates at this establishment are totally inclusive of all meals, wines, and beverage and recreation equipment.  Activities include canoeing, swimming, fishing, tennis, skiing and biking.

Guest rooms contain televisions and in room modem links.  The grounds hold exercise rooms, a sauna, Japanese furo tubs and a rec room.  Outside you can enjoy both cross-country and downhill skiing or take a day hike on one of the hiking trails.

Guest can choose to stay in one of the four rooms within the two-story inn itself or opt for one of nine cottages, each with its own unique details. One of the favorites is the Log Cabin. This is an exemplary cabin (If log cabins usually incorporated a beautiful dressing room, a sybaritic shower and a stunning Rumford fireplace made of river rock). 

Made of hand-hewn hickory and oak and decorated throughout with a whimsical dog theme, this is a nineteenth century homestead turned romantic retreat. Local artisans carved the twig work on the handsome cabinets and the granite surfaces. The Cabin dogs, from paw print rug to the dog head finials on the king size bed, offer comfort, grace and warmth in the peace of the pine forest

This is just one of the nine individually designed and decorated cabins available.  There truly is one for every taste.  In addition to the cabins and four rooms within the main building, Twin Farms offers two suites that can accommodate two couples each.  They will even help you arrange a house party if you desire to have one.
