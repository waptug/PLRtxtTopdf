The term "burglary" is used to refer to a house breaking, a crime associated to thievery. Because of this, a man named Edwin Holmes spearheaded the inventing and installing of the first burglar alarm system in the world in the year 1858. 

This invention was first introduced in Boston, Massachusetts. The first burglar alarm can be associated to a simple machine; a spring is being freed on the window or door's opening, then through this the electrical circuit will be closed. 

Then, as time evolved, the burglar alarms evolved along with it. Today, several types of burglar alarms are available in the market, but those alarms are not only good to signify a break in, they can also be used in alerting the fire authorities for the occurrence of fire.

The fire burglar alarms today are founded in the form of electronics. Its sensors are attached to the control unit through hardware with low-voltage or to a narrowband RF indicator, and then it is hooked up to announce the alarm, this works to gain some response. 

The fire burglar alarm is helpful in alerting people inside the building for a possible fire. Through this, people are being notified that they need to look for a safe place. This also alerts the closest emergency personnel, thus, preventing the spreading of fire.  

Furthermore, smoke detectors and heat detectors trigger the fire alarms. They are normally set to determine the level of smolder or heat that may indicate a fire. The alarm can be in the form of loud bell, or with the flash of lights intended for people who have hearing deficiency.

There are a number of different forms of fire alarm systems being offered in the market. If you are planning to buy one, try to search for the best one by surfing in the Internet. You can also search for a manufacturer or dealer in your local area.

The price of the equipment may come in two systems—purchased or leased. Since the systems need to be installed, it may also be added with a charge of one-time installation fee. The costs of the systems begin at about $20 for basic types and may go up to $ 20,000 for the upper-class types. 	

For home utilization on the other hand, it is already sufficient to have the basic method with monitoring. This will only range to about $100 to $300. 

In addition to these, there are also monitoring fees given to the local fire units since the system also alert them. Although these will not be expensive, these may only be about $30 each month.  
 	
Though the equipment and its installation, including the regular fees for monitoring, sounds to be heavy in the pocket, this are still considered as valuable investments. 

The costs of these machines are actually nothing compared to the costs of the damage a fire may cause, or worse, the point of losing the lives of people in a fire, hence, the investments for fire alarms really worth it. 

Still, there are other points to consider. The systems of fire alarms need to be tested yearly to ensure that it is properly functioning. But before doing it, notify the fire authorities of the testing to be conducted to prevent them from coming out needlessly.
