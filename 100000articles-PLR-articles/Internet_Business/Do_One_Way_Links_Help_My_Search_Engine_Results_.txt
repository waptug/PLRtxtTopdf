One way links are a tool that can be quite beneficial to the webmaster. The webmaster’s ultimate goal is to have many visitors coming to his website in the hopes that they will look around and even make some purchases. The problem is, though, that you have to get your visitors there. One way links may be able to help you. They help to create traffic to your website so that you will achieve a better rank in the very important search engines.

What is important to note here is; that there is no 100% perfect way to get at the top of the search engine results. But, there are many things that you can do to work your way up this ladder. One of them is using one way links. These links are quite simply a link to your website from someone else’s website. Even though you have your link on their page, you do not have to put their link on your page. That’s a nice benefit because it keeps the visitor at your site, rather than wandering off. Also, it is beneficial because the other website owner (the one that your link is at) is going to do his best to get traffic to his site. Some will come to yours through his website. That means increased traffic from minimal amounts of work.

Why Does A One Way Link Rank You Better?

This is the bottom question. Why do search engines think that your website should rank better when you have one way links to it? One reason for this is because if your link is there, the website owner is attesting to the quality of your website. In fact, the search engines also believe that these links are better than reciprocal links because of this fact. The search engines are even ranking those websites that use quite a few reciprocal links less highly because of this fact.

Because the other website owner is committing to you by placing your link on his page and not getting anything back in return, this is held at a higher standard than those that purchase reciprocal links.

How To Get Them

Of course, the hard part is getting the one way links in the first place. Not many webmasters are going to provide this to you if you just ask. If you have excellent quality content that is directly related to their website, they may do so. More than likely, they will want something in return.

One method that many have found that works well is to use article directories. Here, you will produce a well written, informative article (or more) about elements that may be in your website. Then, at the bottom you simply add in your link and information. Webmasters come to the directory to find solid, quality content to put on their website. To use your material, they have to use your link too. It’s a win win situation because now you have a one way link on their site to yours.

One way links are a tool that will help your website rank well in the search engines.
