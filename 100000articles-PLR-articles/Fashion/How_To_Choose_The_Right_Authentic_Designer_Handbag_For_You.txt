With so many authentic designer handbags for sale on the market, you will surely be totally spoilt for choice. So how do you exactly choose one that is right and fitting for you? Well, it depends on a few factors actually; the look of the designer handbag, how it can match with your fashion style and one of the most widely ignored factor; your body type. It is important to match the bag according to your body type as well. Most women often overlook this.

You have to avoid targeting the most popular and recent fashion craze when choosing an authentic designer handbag and instead you should try to get one which you will look good with when you wear them and are practical as well. A handbag is a bag and its main purpose is to keep your belongings as well. You don't want to be carrying your belongings outside your bag would you?

A lot of women make this mistake of purchasing a handbag that is way too big for their body size or way too small for their body size and this could have a negative impact on their whole outlook when they go out to flaunt latest prized purchase only to make a fool out of themselves. You don't want to be a talking point just because you carry an awkward looking bag.

If you are short, do not pretend to be tall. You should instead choose a bottled-shaped designer handbag or a knapsack which is not that large. With that being said, if you have a model-like figure, tall and slim, you should aim for round or square-shaped handbags. The right shape will fit in with your body size.

The right color for your authentic designer handbag is another important criteria you have to think about. If you need a handbag which can match most of your dresses, you should select a colorful style handbag. Do keep in mind to match the color well with dresses that you own. Before going out shopping for a handbag, try to put on the kind of dresses you'll want to match with the new handbag.

Most women tend to be more sensible and will go for a plain-colored handbag as this will easily match with anything that you have in the wardrobe. This prevents you from having a headache when you need to go for an outing with a matching handbag.

Do not overlook your budget as well. Some may even opt for replica designer handbags but is it really what you want to blow your money on?

It can look the same and have the same appeal with great prices to boot but certainly you will feel awkward when walking beside a friend who holds an authentic designer handbag. However, if that doesn't faze you, just go with it.

Not all authentic designer handbags have to be very expensive though. There are many vendors selling them at wholesale prices if you can find them. Remember to also select an affordable authentic designer handbag for your needs. Don't buy something which you cannot afford and then starve for the whole month.
