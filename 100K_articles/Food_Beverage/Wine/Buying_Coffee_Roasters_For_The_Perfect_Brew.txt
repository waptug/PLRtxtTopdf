There are a variety of machines now available to turn your kitchen into a coffee lover’s paradise. You can buy espresso machines, cappuccino makers and coffee bean roasters that will ensure you are drinking the freshest possible coffee, made to suit your personal tastes. Buying a coffee roaster can be a confusing business, there are a huge range of prices and functions, and a little guidance in what to look for can be really valuable before you make your purchase. As well as looking for a reliable and well established brand, with a long guarantee, you will want to consider what your personal needs are from your coffee blender.

The first question to ask yourself is how much you want to be involved in the roasting process and how much you want the machine to do the work for you? Some people really enjoy measuring out the amounts, stirring and supervising the process, and in this case a basic stove top model, is ideal as well as being one of the cheaper options.

These are similar to a simple saucepan, with a tightly fitting lid and a special handle. The handle allows you to stir the beans during the roasting process, keeping the hot air moving evenly around the beans and preventing the beans on the bottom of the pan from burning. These type of roasters should have an integral thermometer, as maintaining the correct temperature is a crucial part of the process.

If you would prefer a machine that does everything for you, there are models available with a built in thermostat that controls the amount of heat necessary. They have automatic stirring and air-flow systems to ensure even roasting of the beans, and a timer to shut down the process at the correct time. All you need to do is put in the right amount of beans, switch on the machine, and let it do the rest. Of course you will need to pay more for this type of roaster but this may be worthwhile to get a more even roast with minimal effort.

Another consideration when you are buying your coffee roaster is how effectively does it circulate heat and air? As mentioned previously, even heating and airflow is necessary for a good roast, but this is made more effective if the chaff from burst skins can be removed as the beans are roasting. An additional extra that can make the roasting process more successful is a drum roaster. This moves the beans around using the forces of gravity instead of a stirrer in the base of the roaster.

Most machines enable you to watch the roasting process through a glass panel to ensure you can stop the process at the perfect time for you, even though they have preset times for certain levels of roast. You may have a particular idea about the level of roasting to make the perfect brew that is different from the settings on your roaster.

Once you have decided what the criteria are for your perfect coffee roaster, you can look forward to the fresh coffee that will be constantly available to you, your family and those dinner guests.
