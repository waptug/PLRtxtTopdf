Sometimes accidents do happen. And sometimes, even dents could find their way to your car despite the extreme care you take when dealing and handling your car. There could be very many reasons why your car could get dents. However, dents are still dents and they do not look good on your vehicle – or any vehicle for that matter. 

If there are only small dents like those that your vehicle could get from accidentally bumping into your garage wall, these could be actually removed without much difficulty. In fact, you can actually do it yourself. With the proper instruments, proper equipment, and the right amount of knowledge on how to do it, your vehicle could become dent-free. 

The first thing to do would be to drill a hole in the center of the dent. That way, you can get to the middle of the dent itself and work your way from there. Then, insert a dent pulling tool in the hole that you just drilled. A dent pulling tool could be actually found at auto parts stores as well as other stores that offer automotive items and merchandise. 

When you have the dent pulling tool inserted inside the hole, pull on the tool. Do this until the dent on your car pops out or at the very least, appears flat. When you have achieved this stage, you can then remove the dent pulling tool out of the hole. 

On the other side of the metal sheet which just had a dent, bang out the back of the dent. However, make sure that you do this carefully. You would know just when to stop when you see that it is already smooth. You can do this with a metalworking hammer as well as a dolly. 

When the dent is already smooth, you can now fill the hole you drilled with a body filler and then later on cover the area with touch-up paint. That way, your vehicle would look like it never experienced a dent in its life.
