There are plenty of choices for online home businesses and you could choose anything that makes you happy. In fact, most people switch to the Net rejecting the laurels offered by their promising careers because they enjoy working online. Affiliate programs are considered these days as the best path to financial freedom.  Because of this, affiliate programs are the number one choice for home business for more than 73% of the Netizens worldwide. This is because affiliate programs are indeed the best way to set up perennial sources of residual income. 
 
There are two ways to use affiliate programs to build a comfortable income out of your home business. The first one requires you to be a "promoter" of a company and sell their products in whichever way you find suitable. For every sale you generate, this company would pay you a commission, which ranges in between 2-100%. Start with one such affiliate and learn what it takes to set up a website, advertise, create targeted traffic and generate sales. Once you are comfortable with the whole process, replicate your efforts with as many products as you can. In this way, you would be able to generate a continuous influx of income that would last for as long as the product is offered by the company. 

The second method of earning through affiliate programs is by offering commission to others for selling your product. In other words, you could increase your home based business sales exponentially by inviting others to sell the product (or service) for you in return for a commission. If your commission is right you would find that in no time your products would find new markets from all over the world, and you will be happily counting the profits rolling in. 

As you can see here, there are no real home business secrets to reveal.  As someone once said, the greatest things in life are the simplest. You would find excellent returns from these two methods whereby you could turn any home business into a runaway success. There are a few pre-requisites here, however and you have to be prepared to pay the price:

 (1) Hard work is required: you need to be prepared to work very hard (5-6 hours per day) initially to learn how to market effectively or attract quality affiliates; 

(2) Education is a must: you need to be prepared to unlearn a great deal of things you knew about real world business and instead learn about the functions of the online businesses; 

(3) Self-discipline is an important pre-requisite: you need to have a steel will power so you could work regularly to ensure the success of your business.

If you are ready for all these, you can be assured that your home based business would meet with sure success and you would be able to enjoy, as so many other do, the magic of the Internet and affiliate programs.
