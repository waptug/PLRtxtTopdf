Western wear isn't what it used to be - it's much more than a gal or girl could have ever imagined years ago. Not only can western wear fans find unique cowboy boots and cowboy hats today, they can now accessorize their western wardrobe with many other stylish items, such as western handbags and western wallets. Here's a quick guide to some amazing western fashion products that have come on the scene in recent years.

Western Handbags and Western Wallets

For the ladies, western handbags have become a necessary part of their western ensemble. Who wants to carry a purple or black beaded purse when wearing western clothing, cowboy boots and a cowboy hat? With western handbags, ladies can carry all their personal items, cash, and identification along to the rodeo or anywhere else without sticking out like a sore thumb! They can now carry a western handbag to match their western clothing and blend with the others. 

Western handbags come in an array of designs, colors and sizes to coordinate with almost any western outfit. Mahogany, Ebony & Ivory, Chocolate, Retro, and even Texas Flag styles are all available in "western" style along with many others! Other accessories to go along with western handbags include belts, jewelry, and wallets. Western wallets for the guys also come in different styles and colors.

Western Cell Phone Cases

Now, modern cell phones can blend with western attire with western cell phone cases. These are practical, made with leather for durability and flexibility, and come in different styles and colors. Men and women alike can carry their cell phones without doing injustice to their western clothing!

Western Tack and Western Saddles

Many cowboys and cowgirls won't dress in western wear unless their horse can too! That's why horse tack and western saddles have been made in all sorts of styles to fit every taste. The horse might not understand, but many owners want their horses to look great as well. Western tack and western saddles, along with unique halters, spur straps, and bridles, help to complete the rider's (and horse's) image.

Western Décor for the Home

Many western fans love to decorate their homes with beautiful western décor items such as paintings of horses, Native Americans, western scenes, or farms. Western décor goes wonderfully with paneled, dark brown or pastel room colors. Rustic furniture and tables also look great with western décor accessories.

Gift Ideas for the Western Fan

Western décor items and western clothing make great gifts for the holidays, birthdays, graduation and other special occasions. Shoppers can find all sorts of western products and gifts at online western wear retailers. Many small towns don't have a specialty western product retailer, so the Internet is a convenient solution. And, shoppers never have to leave their home to find great western handbags, clothing, horse tack and other western products.

Western handbags and other items are a great way to express one's love for the Old West!
