With the increase of home-based and new, independent businesses being introduced, the need for obtaining a credit card reader / writer is also growing. The modern credit card readers and writers have in large quantities replaced the old style readers. Who remembers the old-fashioned type of credit card readers where the merchant had to put the credit card on top of the layered paper receipt with all of its carbon copies in the placeholder and slide the plastic arm over the card and receipt with one swoop? Many times that swoop had to be repeated over and over because the ink didn’t take to all of the copies the first, or even second time. You will probably still encounter these portable readers at street fairs and flea markets that have a multitude of individual vendors because the old style card readers don’t require any electricity. Nowadays, it is much faster and easier to process credit card payments and in most any retail shop, restaurant or service business, you will swipe your card through the new type of technologically-advanced electronic credit card reader / writer machines.

If you are in need of a credit card reader / writer for your business, beware because there are a lot of companies out there offering ‘free’ credit card readers / writers that are based on really unethical contracts. Those contacts will bind you to the card processing company for long periods of time even if you are unhappy with their service. The person or company who ‘gave’ you that free machine is now out of loop so don’t bother going to them for help. Before you obtain a credit card reader / writer for your business, make sure to do your research. Look for reputable companies with a long customer service history so that you don’t have to deal with any headaches resulting from making an uninformed business decision. 

Now that you have the information you need to make a wise choice and move forward in purchasing a credit card reader / writer, do an internet search and check out several different sellers. A couple of good websites for you to do your investigating with are www.discountcreditcardmachine.com and www.buyerzone.com. And remember, always be sure to carefully read the specifics of the offers, pricing and contractual requirements of the various merchants you find. By doing some comparative research, you will then be able to select a dependable vendor.
