Among academies, libraries and museums, religious monuments, churches, civil architecture and buildings you will experience you really are in a treasure hunting. For this reason not only tourists, or backpackers but prevalently international students or even international volunteers are choosing this city for their academic courses, stages and studies.

Well, to start, we mention an international place where students, travellers, journalists and actors usually meet: at Acqua al 2 you can get cannelloni, beef, selection of salads, pasta, cheese and excellent wines at average prices of €30. Acqual al 2 is a modern bistro that we suggest in Via Vigna Vecchia ,40; ph: +39 055 284 170; open daily from 7.30 pm-1am).

If you are visiting Florence and you are on a budget and looking for cheap accommodation consider youth hostels, backpackers hostels or international students houses ( hostels as well) where a bed night average price start from 18 euros. The atmosphere is quite basic but somehow fascinating. Florence does not have a long tradition in modern hippie youth hostels as you  might find in other top cities. Florence rather can offer old style hostels, kind of student residence, or pilgrim residence as it was in Medieval times. Monasteries are converted in new pilgrims hostels ( backpackers, students, international volunteers) sometimes still run by nuns or monks. You can find some more details in site for young travellers or backpackers as Flashboking.com.
