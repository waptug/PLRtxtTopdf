The very geography of Florida allows it to have sandy beaches on two oceanfronts. Sugar Beach Inn overlooks the serene waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Looking more like a southern plantation you expect to see the Grande Dame on the veranda sipping mint Juleps. Even the sunshine state has cool evenings but with four fireplaces, the chill is quickly dispelled. Step through the white picket fence and observe Sugar Beach Inn's three floors decorated with the natural foliage of the area. Upon entering the front door there are five Victorian based rooms.

The luxurious four-poster is the centerpiece of the Jasmine Suite. With it's own fireplace and a view of the gulf from the sitting room, this is the master suite. Upon arising from the white wrought iron queen sized bed, step to the veranda for a breathtaking view of the gulf. Following through with our aromatic tour, we come to the Rose Suite. This is the ideal romantic suite with the private rose red bathroom and accentuated with luxurious linens. The brightest, most cheery room is the Sunflower Suite. Here you will find many fun accessories and the queen canopy bed. On the main floor we come to the Rosemary Suite with a choice of a king sized bed or two twin beds. Step out to the veranda to enjoy a close up view of the dunes. 

Start the day with a complimentary gourmet breakfast in the stately dining room. The area is awash in curiosity and antique shops. Sugar Beach Inn is close to many golf, sailing or other water sport locations. Complete your day by dining Al Fresco upon the sugar white sands of the beach. Lay a towel or a beach chair out and be thoroughly amused by the antics of the dolphins just beyond the breakers.
