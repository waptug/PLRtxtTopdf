Online Anonymous Email Accounts for Restaurants

There are online sites that offer this service specifically for restaurants. You can open anonymous email accounts to use for different purposes. Your message will be sent to the recipient's address with no indication of who sent it. It will go through their server and any replies will be sent back to them. You will be able to retrieve the reply from your server. It is different than private label email, which provides a separate address for you. Employees or customers who need to email you anonymously can do so without being identified.

You might have knowledge of illegal activities but wish to remain uninvolved, so you could warn the authorities without dread of repercussions. You could send an anonymous email if there are practices at your work place that your boss is not aware of. If you own a restaurant or some other business, you can set up anonymous email accounts that your customers or employees can use to send you important information about your business.

Help Your Restaurant Improve Service

Sending or receiving anonymous email can be helpful for your restaurant managers and yourself by allowing employees and customers to voice their opinions or problems. If they would like to complain or make a comment, they can do so without revealing their identity. This contact can help you or your restaurant manager to identify specific problems or needs. It gives you a chance to see what the customer or employees see and correct problems you were not aware of.

When you go to a restaurant and the service is poor, you may never want to return. Place yourself in your own customers' shoes. By reporting it, you will give the management a chance to correct the problem. With anonymous email, you can prevent this from happening with your restaurant patrons. Instead of losing customers through ignorance, you will have the opportunity to improve service.  

If customers are not satisfied with the quality of the food, they can report by anonymous email. Managers and owners want to know if their customers are not pleased with their meal. Customers will usually not eat in a place where the food is not well prepared and appetizing. If you take their comments seriously, you can greatly improve service and profits for your restaurant. Anonymous e mail makes this possible.

Now, your restaurant employees can send anonymous emails to report difficulties or problems at work. It will protect them from repercussions or censure by other employees. If they witness theft or other illegal practices at your restaurant, they can send a message to enlighten their superiors. You can help improve the work environment and eliminate strife between employees when problems arise.

Sending Positive Comments

If the food was exceptionally good, they can tell you how much it pleased them. Every constructive comment will be appreciated. Your restaurant managers will feel gratified to hear praise for their efforts.
