Article Body:
Taco is highly used in the business of developing and manufacturing hydraulic based components for use in residential, commercial, industrial and institutional heating and cooling systems. 

A pump is a device used to move liquids, or slurries. A pump moves liquids or gases from lower pressure to higher pressure, and overcomes this difference in pressure by adding energy to the system (such as a water system). A gas pump is generally called a compressor, except in very low pressure-rise applications, such as in heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning, the equipment is known as fans or blowers.

Pumps or circulator pumps are an integral part of any hydronic system when installing or adding radiant heat to homes and businesses. These pumps are used to send water to an area of the hydronic system when it is called for, or to keep the flow of water in the system. PexSupply.com features a large selection of Cast Iron and Bronze taco pumps, including the best-selling 007 Taco Pump, reliable Bell and Gosset pumps and Taco IFC Pumps with Integral Flow Chek.
