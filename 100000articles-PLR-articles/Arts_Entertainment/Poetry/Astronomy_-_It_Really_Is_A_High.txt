Astronomy and space is all about lust for learning. Did you know that astronomy is one of humanity's oldest sciences? In fact, astronomy is one of the earliest sciences that humanity has ever pursued. So the study of our universe is not new but you should remember that astronomy is a science. A science for the masses. And, astronomy is a field about which most of the world knows very little. 

Astronomy is really an outdoor nature hobby. Astronomy is also a place where international boundaries blur. It is as pure a science as one can find as it studies the Universe and what is in it. It is also an observational science that requires observations and precise calculations, particularly of positions of celestial objects. Astronomy is truly bigger than all of us.

Most of modern astronomical research involves a substantial amount of physics and can be considered astrophysics. What is the basic difference between Astrophysics and Astronomy? How stars form is one of the central unknowns of astrophysics. Astronomy is more a matter of making observations.

The telescope is undoubtedly a very important investigative tool in astronomy. Did you know that Galileo was the first human to use a telescope for astronomy? Purchasing a telescope is something that most people who get interested in astronomy need to do. If you want to buy you a telescope, but it all looks confusing to you, be sure to do some analysis. Because buying a telescope, like purchasing a automobile or stereo equipment, is subject to your tastes as a buyer. But your choice of a telescope is critical as the telescope is focused on space and astronomy access for all of us.

Telescope parts and accessories can be a very useful addition to your astronomy experience. If you're just starting out, look for a quality, affordable telescope for beginning astronomy students and casual observers. You might even ask friends if any of them have a telescope for sale. But the aim is to take advantage of the latest developments in telescope technology to make the next giant leap forward in observing. Many people use the telescope regularly for star parties, astronomy workshops, and casual observing.

Public curiosity in astronomy is unlimited. Astronomy is our tool for unlocking the knowledge of the heavens. As mentioned above, it may be a science, but it also is an outdoor nature hobby. But don't worry, you'll see that astronomy is more than just a branch of science, it's cool too. Astronomy is a wonderful field of science for the family to study. Astronomy is all about curiosity, and fulfilling that curiosity.
