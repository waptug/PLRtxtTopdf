Avoiding Stress

	As I write this article, I am juggling so many balls that I want to duck my head, expecting them to crash at any moment.  I am the queen of stress.  As such, I’ve had a lot of practice dealing with stress and helping to keep it from driving me to the funny farm.  
	I try to let the little things go.  This is really big for me, because I want to control everything and every situation – because I can do it better.  I’ve had to let go of the things that really don’t matter so that I can devote my energy and focus on things that do.
	I do a lot of deep breathing.  When you feel things getting out of hand and you don’t have a second to spare, that’s the time when you need to take a minute and stop.  Just stop.  Take a deep breath and stretch your arms up high in the arm.  Circle them around and stretch them to the sides.  Breathe in and out.  Then continue what you were doing, and you should find that it’s a little easier to deal with.  
	Get some help.  When you just cannot do it all, find others that can help you.  This is another area that is hard for me.  It goes back to the fact that I can do it best and I want it done my way.  Realize that other ways will work just as well and let someone help you.  
	It is so important that we watch our stress and make sure that it doesn’t take over.  Stress affects so many things in our bodies and controls how we interact with other people.  Watch your stress levels and take care of yourself.  Your body will thank you later.
