If barreling down a mountain of snow doesn’t excite you, then maybe you will find your place with the fishermen. Many people take Tahoe vacations just to fish. People will drive amazing distances because of the great fishing that the streams and lakes in this area have to offer. From October 1 to June 30, the streams that drain into Lake Tahoe and their tributaries are closed to fishing. However, many of the lakes, including Tahoe, stay open year round. 
 
There are many kinds of fishermen that go on Tahoe vacations. Some like to troll the lakes and streams, and some fly fish. Just make sure that you have any license that you are required to have, and follow the rules. 
 
Golf has become more and more popular in recent years and many people hit the Tahoe vacation spots for the premier golf courses. Golf is a sport that is popular to a wide array of people. The sport doesn’t restrict because of social class, race, age, or gender. More and more people are getting into it everyday. Even those who don’t golf can appreciate the natural and man-made beauty of the greens. And there are many courses to choose from on your Tahoe vacations. 
 
When you are going on Tahoe vacations, remember to bring the right gear – including sun block. Whether you are going to ski, snowboard, fish, golf, or simply soak in the beauty that is Tahoe, take care of your skin while you are there. When there’s snow on the ground, some people may not even think of the need for sunblock. This is a big mistake since sun’s rays can actually reflect off of the snow and ice creating an even more intense effect. When you are on the snow, make sure that you wear all protective gear included tinted goggles. The bright reflections off of the snow can also be bad for your eyes.

With a bit of planning, you’ll have an incredible time on your trip, and you’ll likely find that Tahoe vacations become an annual event.
