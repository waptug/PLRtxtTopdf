Pros

Electric RC helicopter is one of the more favorable kinds of rc helicopters out there in the market for several reasons:

율t is easy to fly

If you are beginning to take interest on rc helicopters, then the best way to a good start is to buy an electric rc helicopter. It is easy to fly since it only requires batteries for power. You don뇺 have to deal with engines and engine malfunction. You also don뇺 have to buy gas to make it fly. With electric rc helicopters, you don뇺 have to have knowledge about how engines work. You don뇺 need to tinker complicated moving parts since there is none. All you need to know is where the controls and your rc is flying in no time.

율t is quiet

Other rc helicopters, especially the gas powered, create a lot of noise. And this is often times annoying not only to you but also on your neighbor who wants to get some quiet moment alone. Thus, you cannot fly them around your neighborhood. The good thing about electric rc helicopter is that it creates no noise at all. Without an engine, your rc will fly silently anywhere you want it to fly without disturbing the peace.

율t is safe

Batteries are generally safe to use. This also goes with electric rc helicopter. All you have to do is to recharge it when it is empty and it will be off again in the air. You don뇺 have to deal with flammables and you don뇺 have to deal with engine at all.


Cons

Just like any other products, electric rc helicopter has its drawbacks. Here are those:

윲he experience is less exciting

Full-size helicopters have engines and no helicopter is powered by electric current. So you cannot get a helicopter-like experience if wit electric rc helicopter. The engine noise adds up to the experience. Without it, it may be boring.

유ctivity is limited

With electric rc helicopter, all you have to do is charge, fly, re-charge, fly, re-charge again, and fly again. Until you get to hate it. Like what was said earlier, you are limited to flying. Aside to that, no more.

Other RC like gas rc helicopter is more than flying, you get to tinker with the engine and in the process, get more excited every time you fly.
