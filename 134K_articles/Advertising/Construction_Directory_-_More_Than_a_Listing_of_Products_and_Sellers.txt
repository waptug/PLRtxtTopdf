Article Body:
The top construction directories are not just helpful resources for the final consumer who might be trying to find where he can find different construction requirements near his location. Instead, they would be a major resource for industry players with coverage of news, best practices, forthcoming events, regulatory requirements and so on.

The directory section would typically list architects, engineers, manufacturers of construction supplies, real estate related service providers, construction software for different tasks and contractors undertaking different kinds of construction tasks.

The resources section could include different kinds of resources, as determined by the directory publishers. It could include industry news, industry related articles, forthcoming conferences and other events, materials & products information, associations and organizations, government regulations, training resources and career resources. There might also be forums for the construction community to exchange ideas and information.

<b>Construction Directory Proper</b>

Some directories might collect details of your requirements and then forward it to listed suppliers. Others might provide contact details in the directory itself.

Even the directory section is a resource not only for final consumers looking for construction-related services but also for the industry players. For example, they can find freelance workers in different fields to help them complete their contract assignments. 

Directories typically list companies and professionals under major and minor categories. For example, under the major category Engineers, you can find sub categories like Civil Engineers, Land Surveyors, Environmental Engineers, Acoustical Engineers and so on.

With a good construction directory, you could find suppliers for different requirements such as concrete, metals, wood, windows, furnishings, and all the other requirements at or near your location.

Real estate related services typically include agents and brokers, appraisers, developers, investment trusts, mortgage lenders and so on.

Construction software can be for estimating work, design and drawings, 3D projections, project management and other tasks where computer assistance could contribute significantly.

<b>The Resources Section</b>

Industry news could keep you updated about slowdowns in particular sectors, major new projects and other developments.

Articles could illustrate and elaborate on best practices and case studies, for example.

List of events could help you by opening up possibilities for increasing your business by taking part in a trade show, or updating your skills by participating in a seminar, etc.

Technical resources like materials and product information, regulatory resources like environmental regulations, and documents like legal and contract forms are other industry resources that might be available in a construction directory.

<b>Conclusion</b>

A good construction directory would not be merely a listing of suppliers of different construction products and services. Instead, it would be a great resource for the players in the construction industry; in addition to helping final consumers locate the products and services they are looking for.

The resources section of a construction directory might include industry news and developments, best practice articles, forthcoming events like conferences, information on materials and products, regulatory information, different kinds of forms for quick preparation of construction related documents and so on.
