It uses short distance radio signals in order to generate communication between one device and another in close proximity. It is already widely used around the world in particular in bluetooth headsets, used for speaking on your cell phone when driving. However, data can be passed between any bluetooth devices within range.

Bluetooth is the simplest and most widely available technology of its kind. This means that manufacturers can build bluetooth-enabled devices quickly and effectively and pass this saving directly on to consumers. It is also extremely convenient and bluetooth devices are usually incredibly small. This is why it is used in hands free headsets for use with cell phones.

Because bluetooth is the industry standard, this means that it is widely accepted and regularly used by companies from all over the world for many different reasons.

Whether you want to transfer files from your notebook to your computer or you want to talk on your cell phone while you are driving, bluetooth technology is likely to be the answer you are looking for. Businesses and individuals all around the world, use bluetooth on a regular basis.
