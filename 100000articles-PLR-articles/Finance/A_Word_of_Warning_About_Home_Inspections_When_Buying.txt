A Word of Warning About Home Inspections When Buying

When purchasing a home, it should be required that the buyer set up a home inspection on the home. This home inspection is designed to ensure the home is in good condition and to notify the buyer of any potential problems in the home. However, there are some things that potential buyers should be aware of when having a home inspection done.

In order to ensure that the home inspection goes properly, it is important for the buyer to be careful about which home inspection service to go with. Often times, the seller or seller’s realtor will make a suggestion for a home inspection service. Often, they will even offer discounts for using the service. Should you go with the discounted service offered by the seller?

Sure, the discount can be good, but you could potentially be setting yourself up for a big loss in the future. To understand why, first understand that the real estate agent has a pretty big commission on the line. Real estate agents often make 6 to 8 percent of the total sale. This means they have a lot riding on every sale and they are looking to close out every deal they can. While ethics should drive them to be fair in every sale, the sad reality is they are looking after the seller and their commission, not you. Hardly a surprising statement, eh? 

Home inspection services recommended by the agent often carry an unspoken agreement. If the inspection reports are favorable to the seller, the inspector will get more business. If they are not, the seller’s agent will find someone else for future deals. Human nature suggests this situation can lead to certain deficiencies being overlooked by the home inspector, a fact you will inevitably pay for in the future.

The bottom line is that you, as a buyer, need to be aware of the importance of objective home inspections. The inspection is going to tell you if there are any problems with your potential dream home. If there are, you can demand the seller have them repaired, lower the price or pay cash funds at closing so you can have it done. If you use an inspector recommended by the seller or seller’s agent, you run the risk of missing some major problem with the property. Don’t do it!
