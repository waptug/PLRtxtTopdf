You’ve heard horror stories about it, or perhaps you’ve experienced it yourself. Many people have nearly gone insane after the disaster that all computer-dependent individuals shiver at the thought of: the great computer crash. 

A person can literally lose everything he has saved on his computer in a blink of an eye. The reasons are varied. At times it occurs after an ample amount of warning signs, other times it comes as a complete surprise (making it more disconcerting). When these moments happen – and they do happen, and quite often actually – one can only hope that he has saved his files elsewhere, otherwise, there is little hope that they will be recovered. 

Are you scared yet? If you don’t want this to happen to you and your precious files (which I’m almost sure you don’t), read on and find out how to create backups for your many important files. 

But first off, if you’re still not convinced of the importance of backing up, here are a few reasons that might convince you. 

Top Reasons Why You Should Back Up Your Files 

1. One of the few universal truths in life is, no matter how in control you are of your universe, something, someday will inevitably go completely wrong, and usually it is something that will happen beyond your control. The same is true for the files on your computer. No matter how updated and top-of-the-line your hard drive is, it will someday inevitably give up on you and your files. 

2. Numerous viruses abound in the computers of individuals around the world – computers that send and receive files through the Internet. There are also the numerous floppy disks, CDs and flash drives that connect to your computer. Any one of these can be a carrier of a harmful virus that can wipe out the data stored on your computer. If you don’t have a backup for this data, you’re most likely never going to see them again. 

3. Power failures are one of the computer’s worst nightmares (which also include running water and becoming obsolete). They happen without notice, especially when the whether is bad. And power failures can just as easily ruin your computer and all the files on it. It is another good reason why you should back up your files.

The bottom line is it’s better to be safe than to be sorry. There are many ways to bring about a data disaster, and there’s only one way to be prepared for any of them, and that is through backing up your files.
