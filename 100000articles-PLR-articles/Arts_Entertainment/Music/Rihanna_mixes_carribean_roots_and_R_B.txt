Article Body:
Rihanna, whose real name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, is an R&B singer from the Caribbean island of Barbados.  Rihanna was first discovered in Barbados by music producer, Evan Rogers, who along with his partner Carl Sturken, assisted Rihanna in recording a demo to be sent to record labels like Def Jam.  

Upon auditioning for CEO Jay-Z, Rihanna was signed right there on the spot.  In August 2005, she released her debut album, Music of the Sun, which she co-wrote.  The album peaked within the top ten in the U.S., Canada, and the top forty in the U.K., propelled by the hit single Pon de Replay, which climbed to #2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart.  That year, Rihanna also toured with Gwen Stefani, which undoubtedly helped promote the album.  

In April 2006, Rihanna released her sophomore album, A Girl Like Me, which would peak at #5 in the U.S. and #6 in the U.K.  The lead single, SOS (Rescue Me), climbed to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Pop 100, Hot Dance Music/Club Play, and became the biggest first week digital single ever, selling over 169,000 copies in its first week.  

Her second single, Unfaithful, written by Ne-Yo, became her third top 10 hit in the U.S.  Rihanna has several endorsement deals under her belt, including ones for Nike and J.C. Penney.  She also had a cameo role in Bring It On 3.
