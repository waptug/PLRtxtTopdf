Greetings are probably as old as the civilization. People always greet each other whenever they meet or talk. A good morning, hello, how are you, how are things at your end, etc are some of the common ways to begin the conversation. A greeting in everyday life connects us better with another person. One generally does not immediately come to the subject matter without a greeting in almost all meetings.

Printed Cards- As science progressed, people began using printed greeting cards. They are still widely in use. Do you know that some of the first greeting cards were created to convey -Merry Christmas? In todays world, printed card maintains its supremacy, but ecards or egreetings are slowly capturing a bigger space. Convenience of use, ease of selection and less hassle in sending ecards, makes them very popular amongst the younger generation.

How to select ecards? What are the attributes, one should look for in an ecard before sending? Let us begin with Birthdays. This is the day, when we receive many cards and compare who sent which design? So selecting an ecard is important to make a better connection. One cannot simply click on any site, select a ecard at random and send it across. 

What should one look for during the selection? The first consideration is our relationship with the recipient and the second is the personality of the recipient. If one for whom we are choosing the card is a serious or sober kind of person, a hilarious card will not make him/her happy. That is sure. If we are not close to the person we are sending the card, our choice should be a subdued design, isnt it?

Always read carefully what the egreeting conveys, what is the message, etc. Think about the person to whom you are sending the ecard. Will he/she feel happy or great reading the message? If you are very close to the recipient, does the message in the greeting convey your closeness or what you feel from the heart? Take these aspects in mind while choosing.

Choosing greeting cards is an art, and one who perfects this art, enjoys better relationships. So enjoy the world of virtual greetings and send the right ecard to the right person.
