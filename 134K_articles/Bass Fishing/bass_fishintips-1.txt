The Practical Bass Fishing Tips for a Successful Fishing Experience

Many men have found bass fishing quite a relaxing experience. Although Bass fish have been known to be quite a fighter and a struggler the sheer excitement of waiting and finally snagging it releases certain chemicals into the body that provides a euphoric feeling making the experience all worthwhile and satisfying.

Many men and women have come back from a bass fishing expedition feeling light and perky even though they have been outdoors the whole time. The strenuous activity seems to have recharged their bodies.

The popularity Bass fishing has garnered over the years has grown to an all time high with more and more people discovering its joys. Some though are reluctant to start because they have not got a single shred of idea on what to do. Here are some tips to get you started and some secret to act like an experienced bass fish catcher.

Baits 

Artificial baits have been known to catch quite a few Bass! You can also use baitfish, such as a mullet, with much more visually attractive artificial bait over it or with its backbone removed so that it swims more naturally and with a 2-ounce egg sinker on the hook to keep it just under the waves. 

Approach

The best way to get a surface fish, as in any other fishing, is to be sure you keep your distance. Fishing down the creek would help if the water flow is fairly decent. It doesn’t have to be a lot but enough to keep your bait moving. If there are any bushes, trees, or shrubs around try to hide behind them then cast your line in (fly fishing rods are great for this matter).

But remember, to quietly sneak up to them. Any hole with a lot of fish in a river or creek takes a lot of patience. If they hear or see you, you’ll probably not get any bites. Also look for rocks around the creek. If the soil is moist or damp, lift up the rocks and you may find some native worms. . 

For night time bass use a black jitterbug. Replace the hooks with better hooks and if there’s no moon then use some sort of glow in the dark paint on the under side of the lure or they will miss it a lot.

If you have lily pads in a spot or two, then the best advice if it is deep is to run a worm or any soft bait slowly along the bottom right next to the lily pads. You can also buy plastic frogs and mice to skip along the top of the lily pads.

Location

Water weeds extending about five feet out into the water are a very good source of bass cover. You can run any kind of artificial bait along the edge of them and usually snag one or two. Or you can put a weed less worm right in the middle of the weeds.

Try to look for underwater structures like big rocks and big stumps. They serve as cover for the bass. Try all the kinds of lures that you can. Cast in one area around five times just to see if there is any fish that need teasing.

If you catch a fish DON'T LEAVE THAT SPOT stay there and fish more after you have removed the hook. Fish will follow the fish on your line and try to steal the bait. Especially if it is white bass you can sometimes catch two at a time with crappie and perch that is if you have a double rig. 

Worms usually work well during light to heavy over cast skies and spinners usually work better in the morning when the sun is reflecting off the water. When you set the hook, try to keep your line tight and maybe even give it another set. When they jump it is real hard to keep your line tight.

Make sure you aren't using dull hooks. Also, smaller hooks can penetrate easier, making them harder to throw. In most instances, though, nothing beats an aggressive hook set, and then keeping steady pressure on the fish, especially when they go airborne.
