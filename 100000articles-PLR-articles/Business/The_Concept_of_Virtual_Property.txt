In the first month it only makes $50 but it received 1500 unique visitors. Each one of those visitors who made it past the first page is worth $50, so say 500 visitors made it passed the first page you could set your maximum site sale for $25,000 that’s how you rate website for the best price. You probably will only get $5000 or less but still it’s worth the 2 days a week of work for a month.
