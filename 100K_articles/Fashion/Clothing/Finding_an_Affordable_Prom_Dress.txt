If you are new to shopping over the Internet here are some tips to help you through the process.

If you don't find a customer service phone number, you may not want to place the order.  This is a good indication that you would have a difficult time contacting the company if there was a problem with the order. 

Always check out a company with the Better Business Bureau.  Even Internet sites have been listed and reviewed and this is the safest way to ensure that you are dealing with a reputable company.

After speaking with a customer service representative by phone, and reviewing the company with the Better Business Bureau, you should feel confident in placing your order.
