Your Bluetooth headset

Shopping for the Bluetooth headset that’ll supercharge your business? Take the following tips to heart:

Budget is the deciding factor when buying your Bluetooth headset. You’ll have to decide if you’ll go for the $30 or $300 headset or those in-between.

You’ll have to decide if you want boom or no boom. A boom is the small microphone appendage that sticks out from the headset, which you can adjust comfortably.

In reality, there is no assurance that a Bluetooth headset is comfortable. Worn for hours on end, it can become uncomfortable on the ear. You can switch these from the left to the right ear and back again to ease the pressure on the ear.

Better yet, try on the Bluetooth headset before making your final choice, if you’re buying these from a retail shop. These come in different sizes, so you’ll have to consider the people who are going to use these headsets. There are also headsets with eyeglasses clips or interchangeable loops for those wearing eyeglasses.

Other deciding factors when buying your headset

Your headset should be easy to pair with multiple phones. The Bluetooth headset can be paired with multiple phones. By pairing, you are connecting the headset and your phone instantly, and the two will recall each other’s names and connect each time until you decide to break up the pairing.

Choose a better-sized headset. The smaller the headset, the tinier the buttons. If you happen to have fat fingers, you’ll be constantly seeking the on-button and dislodging the headset.

Battery life. The bigger and weightier the headset, the longer the battery life. You have the option to choose somewhere between two to 10 hours talk time and 25 to 250 hours standby time. Remember, you can’t receive calls when you’re down on batteries.
