Article Body:
Brent Conrad with LifetimeResort.com could not agree more and is in full force to help as many people as possible.

Brent Conrad states, my girlfriend and I initially joined up and bought a membership so that we could go to cabo san lucas for $598.00 for eight days and seven nights! After we saw the value and saved over $1,500 on our first trip we were ecstatic to say the least. It was so easy to talk with people about the membership and how much they could save and all the exotic places all over the globe they could visit, that we started letting other people in on the Private Lifetime Membership secret that we knew about. Brent Conrad with LifetimeResort.com and the help of Global Resorts Network (GRN),  soon started receiving checks in the mail for amounts that it would take a normal corporate job 3-4 months to make.

What is your dream job? How often would you like to travel? Do you really feel like wearing a suit for the rest of your life? Would you like to spend ore time with your family?  These are some of the questions that you need to be asking yourself when it comes to making a decision about joining the LifetimeResort.com team of Success. Some members have reported receiving checks over $80,000! Can you imagine making more in one month that 95% of the average American family makes in a whole year?  We can, states Brent Conrad with LifetimeResort.com .  With this opportunity you can really work as little or much as you want to. The desired success is completely up to you, not some big headed boss in his $99 dollar corporate bought chair in a corner office. And guess what, you decide how long to work. You can not get fired because you are your own boss. The freedom of this business is unbelievable. Brent Conrad States that he has never seen so many people make so much money so fast. He contributes this to Global Resorts Network (GRN) founders Al Morales and Chuck Tomlinson that are always in the mix and are on almost all of the daily conference calls. They do not just sit back and relax and collect a check. They care about this company and want it to be here for your kids kids.  

Brent Conrad states, I want to be a millionaire by 2009 and I can almost reach out and grab it. He believes that everyone should right down their goals. There should never be a limit on high you can dream.
