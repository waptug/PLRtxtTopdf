If you have ever wanted to ditch your computer’s plain looking background, there are plenty of options available online for you to download wallpapers. Wallpapers are images of just about anything imaginable that can be used as the background on your computer screen. While wallpapers are a lot of fun and can add some personality to your desktop computer, they are often cheap looking and potentially dangerous. In this article, we’ll give you simple tips for finding high quality wallpapers for your desktop computer.

You are probably wondering how simple wallpapers could possibly be dangerous. Well, the fact is that many sites offer free wallpapers, but do not have the proper tools to fight against computer viruses. When people download these wallpapers to their desktop computer, they can have their whole system compromised by these nasty worms. So, how can you find high quality wallpapers for your desktop computer that won’t cause you trouble? Let’s take a closer look.

The first thing you should do to safeguard both yourself and your computer is install pop-up blockers and spam blockers. In addition, you should also install a reputable virus scan program (such as McAfee) that can alert you to any potential dangers before they infect your computer. The next thing to do is to only download wallpapers from sites that you know and trust. While the internet is a fun place to be, it is filled with a lot of garbage web sites that exist only to wreak havoc on people’s computer systems. If you are unfamiliar with a site, or immediately become bombarded with pop-up ads after visiting, it is best to try another wallpaper service.

Another tip in finding high quality wallpapers for your desktop computer is to download directly from your favorite fan sites. For example, say you are a huge sports fan or you absolutely love a TV show. By going to the official web site of your team or program, you will have a variety of wallpaper choices to select from. This is an advantage over other sites for many reasons. First, you are able to download exactly the image you want without searching all over the internet. Second, the wallpapers provided on these sites will be much better quality than those offered on free sites.

One last way to find high quality wallpapers is to pay for them. While this may sound outrageous to pay for something you can get for free (water anyone?), there are advantages to paying for a desktop wallpaper. Pay wallpapers are the absolute best quality – in both picture and selection. Another benefit to paying for wallpaper is that the site will probably have virus protection, meaning that you can download with confidence.

As you can see, finding high quality wallpapers for your desktop computer doesn’t have to be a hassle. Just be sure to use common sense and trusted providers, and you will be able to download many exciting wallpapers for your computer!
