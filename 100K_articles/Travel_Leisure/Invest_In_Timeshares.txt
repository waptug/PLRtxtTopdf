Taking regular vacations is something that everyone would love but few people actually do. There are many reasons for this I guess, not the least of which is having enough money to get away each year and just relax. For me, one of the biggest reasons that vacations never materialized for my family was because of the stress that it took to plan a great family vacation. Each year we talked about planning a great trip, but when it came to actually planning the trip our efforts were haulted. That all changed, however, when we discovered the wonderful world of timeshares.    I knew that timeshares existed long before I purchased some of my own, but I thought that they were only for people with excess money that never had to struggle to pay the bills. When I stumbled upon the idea of owning timeshares for myself many of my preconceptions were changed.

Basically, the idea of timeshares is that many people purchase a share of time to own a particular condo or vacation home. For example, purchasing timeshares of a condo for the month of January means that you own that condo for that share of time. The idea of timeshares is great for many reasons.

For me, timeshares lessened the stress of planning family vacations each year. With timeshares I knew in advance where we would vacation, where we would stay, and how much it would cost us. The only details to consider were transporation to and from our home to the location of our timeshares and the food we ate while we were away. Timeshares took a lot of the research and hassle out of planning.    Another reason I have come to love timeshares is because they are located in a variety of places. Whether you want to vacation in Florida, Colorado, or just outside of Paris each year, I almost guarentee that there are timeshares to be purchased in the area of your choice. There is no limit to the kinds of vacations your family can enjoy with timeshares.

I love the predictability of owning timeshares. There is no guessing when it comes to vacation each year. My family and I can enjoy returning to the same vacation spot year after year because we own timeshares. However, another great benefit of owning timeshares is that often you can trade timeshare locations with other owners. When you get tired of visiting the condo that you have purchased in Florida you can trade with an owner for a timeshare in Washington or North Carolina instead.

If you are looking for a great way to enjoy years of great vacations, consider if timeshares might be right for you.
