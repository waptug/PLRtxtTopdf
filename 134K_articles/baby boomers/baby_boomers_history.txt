The Secrets behind the Baby Boomers Controversial History


Throughout mankind's history, nothing beats the most egoistic generation-the baby boomers generations. Their history was presented through sayings, vignettes, quotations, and slogans which characterized and shaped them. The pleasure, the pain, and the trauma of times fall right into perspectives. 

They protested everything including their civil rights, animal rights, and viewpoint on foreign wars. All through the years, they become witnesses of histories, made a few of it, and later on produced pop cultures treasured with aphorisms. These sayings, quotations, and slogans are the striking view of change and growth. 

For them, their rich history lies on their music albums, books, movies, and TV shows greatly remarkable for people who deeply influenced them. These key events are represented in a way that it became a portion of the collective subconscious of many people. 

Baby boomers grew up on the most prosperous generation wherein they were protected in small towns and suburbs, enjoying better health as well as expecting fuller, longer lives compared to their predecessors. They live through the greatest and longest period of economic prosperity. However, this way of living only made them see the world through unfulfilled promise, self-doubt, and longing. 

Baby boomers become more idealistic than realistic. They became alienated and disillusioned with their country if the things they wanted to happen were not realized. From their infancy, the opportunity of fertile fields lay beneath their feet offering them with growing wonders and asking them to use it in the best way they can. But they suffered when their parents protected and pampered them only to build a generation that is free from deprivation and fear. As a result, they gave birth inadvertently to two split waves of egocentric activists, the leftist and the rightist produced along the continued series of counterrevolutions and cultural revolutions. 

The distinctiveness of baby boomers born after the World War II cannot be denied. They were set out in saving the world reaching up to a population of 76 million. It was because experts predicted that the birthrate declines in America would continue. When men of WWII return home, it was settled that the safe and old routine of bearing children should be again adopted.  The agreement was a freak incidence caused by material affluence, war victory, fear of loss, and youthful optimism. 

Baby boom was also caused by the Cold War in the 1950's giving emphasis on family's strengths and moms staying at home, getting pregnant, and attending to the kitchen. Even after the Nagasaki and Hiroshima bombing, almost 16 million GIs returned to America. Moreover, the amount of babies born per month reached 338,000. It was been said that the 1945 population of babies was increased to one million, then from 1954 to 1957, four million baby boomers was born peaking at 4.3 million. The census reveals that there are 38,038,000 men and 38,503,000 women in their ranks, 61 million are white, 9 million are black, and the remaining 6 million are comprise of the Asian, Indian, and Hispanic race. Most of them are proud to belong to the elite cohort.

Baby boomers attended their elementary as well as secondary education during the 50's and 60's. Some boomers were even called to serve in the Vietnam War, others just entered their adulthood, and some are already working. Somehow, women baby boomers held off marriage to give way to their careers. 

The second wave of baby boomers (1958 onwards) doesn't have a strong generational identity compared to the first wave. Generation Gap occurred since their elders don't trust these baby boomers. The first wave became hippies while the second wave became punks. Both waves express their dissatisfaction of the world but they entirely assumed the American Dream in different dimensions. First wave baby boomers surpassed or equaled the standard living of their parents. The second wave was the exact opposite, they rely more for financial support from their parents. 

They established their beliefs that someday they will run the country's institutions, redefine old age and retirement, generate more money, and experience extraordinary leisure. However, baby boomers never close the possibilities of receiving all kinds of mockery and generational gauntlet challenging them to rise in their golden promise. Baby boomers really take their part in the transformation of the society.
