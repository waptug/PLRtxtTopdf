	The plus size swimsuits on sale at most stores are frumpy one piece getups that look more like they were made for your grandmother then your frame. The good news that in the recent years plus size swimwear has been transformed into high fashion pieces that will make you look as cosmopolitan as a Brazilian g-string does. 

	When shopping for plus size swimsuits keep in mind 3 important rules, size, cut, and fit. 

The size of the plus size swimwear should be what fits you, not necessarily what you usually wear in regular clothing. Many plus size swimsuits are made for full figured women, and actually will run a size or two larger then a typical garment. This is why it's very important to try swimsuits on at the store, and make sure the size is just to your liking. Plus size swimsuits like most swimwear and intimates usually is non returnable for sanitary reasons, thus it's imperative you have the suit on your body before you purchase it to confirm it does indeed fit. 

	When dealing with the cut of the suit, remember what you are looking for, style, comfort, and coverage. You don't want that plus size bikini that looks so nice on the not really plus sized model that is wearing it in the store. You will be better off with a tank bikini or a trendy one piece. There are more options now then ever before for trendy plus size swimsuits, and the selection is only going to get bigger. This is important to understand so that you don't end up settling for plus size swimsuits that aren't your fancy. Only buy a plus size swimsuit that you are totally in love with, because there is such a wide variety these days you don't have to settle for a suit you don't like.

	The fit of your suit should be loose enough so that you can breathe properly and tight enough to show your features. The plus size swimsuits of yesteryear that made you look like a big ball of lycra are long gone, and now you can look great with your plus size swimsuits every day of the summer. The fit should hug your chest, and accent your behind in a way that makes you feel sexy. Remember there is no reason plus size swimsuits can not be sexy, so feel free to go for it, get something that will catch all the men's eyes as you walk by. 

	A full figured woman is every bit entitled to look sexy as any other shape of women. Find a plus size bathing suit that meets your needs, and wear it with the confidence that you know you have deep inside of you.
