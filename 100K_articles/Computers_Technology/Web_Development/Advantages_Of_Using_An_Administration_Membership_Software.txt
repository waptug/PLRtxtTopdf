When your organization is still young, you probably won't have any problems managing your members and their activities.  However, once your organization begins to grow, you might have some difficulty maintaining your database using just a simple pen-and-paper system or a basic program included in your Mac or PC.  When this happens, the best thing for you to do is to use a membership administration software.

What is a membership administration software?
A membership administration software is a management system that allows you to maintain, modify and update records of your members, regardless of whether you're a small group or a large organization.  It is a program designed to suit the needs of clubs, organizations and associations, allowing them to perform a variety of tasks, ranging from the simple to the complicated.

What you'll get
Most membership administration software are available as basic applications, containing just the right kind of features that will allow you to keep track and manage your club's memberships.  Often, a basic software will include enough features to maintain a membership database.  

This will let you input important member information such as name, address, contact numbers, paid membership or subscription dues and other personal and professional details.  A basic version will also allow you to use features such as mail merge and direct email.

The basic version will work well for you if your organization has 10 to less than 1,000 members and if you have a structure that is simple and more direct.  This membership administration software should be enough to help you keep your records, input new entries, perform modifications, keep track of subscriptions paid and give you a general or detailed reporting.

However, if your organization has grown or uses a more complicated structure, you might benefit more from higher versions of membership administration software.  It contains everything that is offered in a basic software, except that these versions allow you to maintain a database ranging from thousands of members to unlimited membership.

These versions also allow you to store more detailed personal and professional information and even classify your members depending on their status or the type of membership they chose or paid for.  You can even build your members' relationships to other organizations such as a sponsor, an employer or an organization similar to yours.

Other features
Many membership administration software go beyond the usual storage-and-database features.  Most of them can even help you keep track of membership attendance, inactive memberships and family subscriptions.  You can even perform some bookkeeping duties by using the software to keep track of your organization's cash receipts and bank reports.  Payments and incidental expenses may also be recorded using this software. 

Membership administration software also offer features that allow you to record your members' special interests, schedule activities like lectures and conferences and even input the competencies required for each of your members.

Why you should get a membership administration software
If you foresee growth in your club or organization, it would be a wise investment to use a membership administration software.  Whether you're buying it for single or multiple-use, this application will make all your membership storage and collection duties a lot easier.  

Not only that, you will find it more convenient later when you need to conduct tracking, monitoring and even auditing.  All the information you need are already available at the click of a button.
