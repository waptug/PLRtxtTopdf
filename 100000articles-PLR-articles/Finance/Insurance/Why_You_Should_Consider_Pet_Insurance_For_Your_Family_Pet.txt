<b>Pet Accident Insurance </b>

As the name suggests, with a pet accident insurance you are getting the basic minimum in pet insurance – accident coverage.  Under this policy the insurance company will reimburse you for all costs and expenses you incur caused as a result of your pet having been involved in an accident (unfortunately, more often than not, this means a road accident).

<b>Pet Accident and Illness Insurance</b>

With pet accident and illness insurance you get full coverage insurance; namely, your insurance company will agree to pay for all the costs and expenses incurred as a result of your family pet having suffered any illness or accident.

<b>Excess Amount</b>

One thing you do need to keep in mind when arranging your family pet insurance is the excess amount.  As with all insurance policies, the excess amount is the amount you and the insurance company agree you’ll pay before you are entitled to claim against the insurance policy.  While it is always a good idea to set an excess amount that would cover you for any mundane visits to the vet, so as to keep the premium down if nothing else, you don’t want to se the excess too high that you end up having to pay for care and attention you thought would be covered by the pet insurance policy.  It is, therefore, advisable that you have a look at some of your more recent vet bills and try and mind a medium between these sums so you have some idea of the excess before you set off arranging your family pet insurance.
