A direct deposit cash advance is a quick and easy way for retirees who receive private pensions payments to obtain cash that they may need unexpectedly. Retirees are seldom financially secure since so many rely on a fixed level of income. Even budgets based on a relatively high fixed incomes can be upset by unforeseeable emergency expenditures.

One of the biggest advantages of direct deposit cash advances for retirees is that there are no restrictions on the way the borrowed money may be used. With cash in hand, retirees can use it to help cover the part of medical bills and prescription medications not covered by Medicare. Some may need to apply the funds to home or auto repair.

Another benefit of direct deposit cash advances for retirees is the ease of the online application process. In about 30 minutes, an individual can complete the application process. This consists of providing basic details such as your name, the cash advance amount you’re interested in obtaining, and information about your bank account and your private pension. Once the information is verified, approval can be forthcoming.

As the name implies, direct deposit cash advances are deposited directly into your bank account the next business day following loan approval. Since the funds are directly deposited into your designated checking account at your bank, the recipient is not required to devote precious time waiting in line at a bank branch to deposit a check. And because the funds are directly deposited, there is no hold period on the funds as there might be when depositing a check drawn on a different bank than that of the borrower. This means that on the day that your loan is posted to your bank account, the money is yours to spend as you need.

A repayment schedule will be created as part of the application process based on the date that you are scheduled to receive your next recurring pension payment. This is within 30 days of the date of the submission of the loan application. Remember, this is a cash advance meant to be only a short-term loan so money is to be repaid quickly. Repayment is just as easy as the loan initiation process. When your next private pension payment is deposited into your bank account, the amount of cash advanced will be automatically debited from your account to repay the loan. From there, the funds will make their way back into the account of the cash advance company and your repayment obligation will be fulfilled. Loans may usually be extended for no more than two or three pay periods based on state law and the policies of the lender, but, since the fees for such extensions would become substantial, these limits cannot be exceeded by borrowers.

As you can see, direct deposit cash advances for recipients of recurring pension payments are superior to the alternative means of obtaining short-term cash. This is a ready source of funds available in a reliable, secure, and confidential manner from any location with a personal computer that has a connection to the Internet.
