<p>Mesothelioma is a form of cancer which is being discovered more and more frequently in elderly men.  The most common cause of mesothelioma is from asbestos exposure and affects the membrane of many of the most vital internal organs such as the lungs and heart.  Mesothelioma is particularly hard to diagnose because it shows similar symptoms to many other more common diseases.</p>

<p>The most common form of mesothelioma is called pleural mesothelioma.  This type of mesothelioma accounts for 75% of all mesothelioma cases.  Pleural mesothelioma affects the lining of the lungs and has symptoms such as chest pain, coughing, breathing and swallowing difficulties, shortness of breath, wheezing and weight loss.  These symptoms apply to many less serious diseases but anyone with signs of these symptoms are strongly advised to consult their doctor as soon as possible.</p>

<p>A less common form of mesothelioma is peritoneal mesothelioma and this form of the cancer affects the abdomen.  The tissue lining the abdomen is called the peritoneum and this is what is affected.  Peritoneal mesothelioma accounts for 20% of all mesothelioma cases. The symptoms of peritoneal mesothelioma are weight loss, abdominal pains, loss of appetite, weakness, nausea, and abdominal swelling.  These symptoms become more and more severe as the cancer develops.  To learn more about these symptoms go to <a href="http://www.1-mesothelioma.co.uk">http://www.1-mesothelioma.co.uk</a></p> 

<p>Those who are exposed to asbestos or have been exposed have a risk of obtaining mesothelioma.  It is important that mesothelioma is diagnosed in its early stages so that it can be treated quickly and aggressively.  The earlier it is discovered, the more likely the treatment will be successful.</p>
