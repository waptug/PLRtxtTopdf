You recall your first car?  Was it a hunk of junk or a nice one? You may have resorted to the local newspaper for your car information in order to find that inexpensive, little jalopy. Or perhaps you were lucky enough to receive one is the gift or be able to afford one yourself.  No matter where you searched, one thing was for sure; you wanted a good deal. In the past, this could often prove a difficult task.  If it was bought from a dealer, he could make up any outrageous price that he wanted to, and if you went to an individual that had a car for sale you could end up with a junker and not know it until a month later and then you would be totally out of luck. This is really that big of a deal now a days. A deluge of car information is at your fingertips online.

I still remember my first car like it was yesterday. It was a 1978 Fiat Spider convertible.  I got it from a college kid for $1100. It was a pretty decent first car. I mean I wasn't expecting a Porsche for $1100. It was one of those cars that you couldn't just let sit around not using it.  You had to start everyday so it would turn over when you took it out for a spin. I recall one instance where I had not started it for three consecutive days.  Big mistake, but fortunately I could always pop the clutch. While this wasn't the greatest car in the the universe, I definitely knew one thing, the seller provided all necessary car information upon my test drive so there wasn't any confusion. He has all the paperwork in order including service and maintenance records.  It would be nice if everyone was as prepared.

If you're heading out to a dealership to find that new family van, or sports car, it's always a good idea to do your homework online first.  The Internet is a vast reservoir of knowledge and information.  It truly is a priceless resource. The car information online will save you plenty of like work. You know that you want a safe vehicle, and you know you want to avoid getting ripped off. Well, with the car information found on the World Wide Web, your worries should be subsided. The dealers no longer have the upper hand, that now belongs to us, the consumer. But the advantage is only hours if we choose to use it. 

When you step into that dealership, you know what the vehicle sells for. The Internet will prevent you from being ripped off by exorbitant pricing.  With your PC you can check out the numerous car sites in your area to see who's offering what. There are even online sales that can be found on auctions such as Ebay and other state and federal auction sites run by government agencies. The buyer is now the one in charge when purchasing that new car. With car information so accessible, finding that ride of your dreams is a synch.
