\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 We have all
 come to know the familiar sound of the helicopter overhead that is flying quickly
 from the scene of a tragic car crash to the nearest trauma center at a nearby hospital
.  We may have even known someone who has needed to utilize such air ambulance service
.  Do you know the history behind these marvelous methods of medical transportation
?\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Think back
 nearly a century ago.  During World War I, air ambulances were first introduced
.  Between 1914 and 1918, a           variety of military organization tested the
 use of flying ambulances to treat patients.  Over time, this beginning has spawned
 into the air ambulances of today.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 What later
 became the Royal Doctor Flying Service started in the year 1928.  This milestone
 event was the first air ambulance service ever to exist.  This service began in
 the Australian Outback.  This non-profit organization was intended to provide service
 to people living in the remote areas of the Outback.  The Royal Doctor Flying Service
 provided emergency medical care, as well as, primary care for individuals who found
 it difficult to reach general healthcare facilities or hospitals due to the distance
.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 In 1934, 
Marie Marvingt started an air ambulance service.  This was the first civil air ambulance
 service in Africa.  The air ambulance service was established in Morocco.  Again
, the remote areas and terrain played a role in the decision to begin this service
 in the specific location.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Marie Marvingt
 used her pioneering spirit and record-breaking personality to help others when 
she began the air ambulance unit.  She was the first woman to fly combat missions
 as a bomber pilot.  She also was a qualified nurse.  Specializing in aviation medicine
 she was the perfect candidate to begin the air ambulance service in Morocco.  In
 fact, she worked to establish air ambulance services worldwide.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 It was in
 1936 that a military air ambulance service assisted wounded.  The injured were 
evacuated from the Spanish Civil War.  The wounded received treatment in Nazi Germany
.   \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The Saskatchewan
 government established the first civil air ambulance in North America in 1946.  
Regina, Canada was home to this landmark service.  Still today the air ambulance
 service is in operation.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Only one 
year later in 1947, Schaefer Air Service began.  This was the first air ambulance
 service in the U.S.  Founded in Los Angeles, California by J. Walter Schaefer.  
The Schaefer air ambulance service also became the first to be FAA certified in 
the United States.     \par}

 helicopter began service at the hospital of Harlaching, Munich.  This unit was 
called Christoph 1.  As the idea spread over Germany, the air ambulance service 
continued to grow rapidly.  By 1975, Christoph 10 began service.  Currently, around
 80 helicopters are being used as air ambulances in Germany.  Each unit is named
 after Saint Christopher, the patron saint of travelers.  \par}

 was home to the first hospital-based air ambulance medical helicopter in the United
 States.  In 1977, Flight for Life began.  Soon, the helicopter air ambulances expanded
 to use other types of aircraft.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 In 1977, 
Ontario, Canada a flight paramedic program began with a single rotor-wing aircraft
.  Today, this program has become the largest and most sophisticated air ambulance
 program in North America.  The fleet is dispatched to over 17,000 missions annually

 a Bell47 then progressed to a BO 105.  Currently, they use a BO 105 and an EC-145

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Today, the
 air ambulance industry has grown and expanded to become worldwide.  Aircraft vary
 from helicopters to jets.  The medical advances and technology has also grown to
 include high-tech tools and equipment that can effectively monitor and prolong 
life during medical emergencies in the air.   }}
