Making the leap and deciding to invest is the first step - whether to start a business, invest in the stock market, real estate, or some other venture it's going to demand knowledge, skill and may or may not impact your financial stand point once it's all said and done. All investments carry at least some kind of risk, and as a result of risk people feel nervous when it comes to making investments.

Despite the large or small risks, to get your money working in your favor and growing for you will mean an investment of some sort. It is simply a matter of selecting the right investments, diligent maintenance and usually holding out to the end rather than pulling out before the term is due. This is a hard concept to learn and it's actually bit me more than once myself too! 

Here are some suggestions to help you with investments that will increase your capital with time.

Determining the risk factor before you jump with both feet off something you'll regret later:

The first thing one should keep in mind is potential risk of the investment you are going to make. Consider the effect on your life if you lose every penny you are going to invest. This will help you to determine if you’re over investing and taking too high of a risk. You might even have to put yourself on a certain budget so that you only invest a certain percentage of the dollars you earn. This way you'll be investing out of your excess capital and not your laundry money (:--). 

Probably all investments possess risk, but some are more risky than others, sound advice from a successful investment agent can go along way. Don't be afraid to ask really "dumb" questions and keep asking till you understand the topic. This is your money were talking about here and were not playing monopoly anymore. 

High-risk investments do have their obvious benefits, that being short term, large gains. These high risk investments can be stressful unless you’re playing with "house" money or money that you've earned and it won't hurt too much if you lose it all. High risk investments are not for everyone, some just can't handle the stress of possibly losing their hard earned cash. This might be you; if you’re not sure you can first try with some small investments, just to prepare yourself for some big ones. By doing so, you will get a feel for the market and see what's it's all about while learning.

Make sure that you are not borrowing money or spending money that you may need elsewhere, and make sure that the loss of money will not disturb your life style in any way. I've also been bitten by this one. On the bright side I'm learning what not to do.

Tracking Your Past Investments Performance:
If you'll be making investments in fields like stocks and bonds, it is very important to know and track the historical performance of the respective company or bond. Once your research has been thorough than make your move. 

If you do not see any increase in price value of the stock or bond for the last couple of months but it seems to be steady then it could be a good potential for a long term investment. Steady growth is a good indication for potential growth in the near future, which after a long period will yield better than short-term investments.

Investigating Recent News:

The best way to keep updated about the market is to read financial and business news. Searching these topics online can make you familiar with recent market events. Above all try to have fun. Once you get the hang of regular, calculated investing you might find the stress is not too bad and the financial rewards are very enjoyable!
