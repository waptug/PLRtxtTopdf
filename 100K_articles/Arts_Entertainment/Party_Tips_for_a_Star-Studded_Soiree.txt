Whether planning backyard barbecues or swanky dinner parties, the best hosts use special touches to make their gatherings memorable and fun.

The maker of Perfect Glue offers these easy-to-make projects to help create a spectacular July Fourth soiree.

* Star-studded invitations: Print party details on white cardstock and trim to the desired size and shape. Apply a thin line of Perfect Glue 1 to the edges of the card and glue onto a larger piece of patterned cardstock. Glue a piece of patterned ribbon on the back, along the top of the invitation, then glue a star cutout in the center of the ribbon. 

* Star-embossed table runner: Turn the edges of your runner fabric under and glue. (You can speed the drying time by covering the area with a clean towel and pressing with a steam iron.) Trace a star template onto heavyweight fabric and cut out. Arrange the stars along the runner. Put Perfect Glue 1 on the backs of the stars and apply to the runner. Dry for one hour before handling. 

* Firecracker favors: Cut patterned paper to fit mailing tubes and glue into place. Embellish with patterned ribbon at the top and bottom of the tube. Glue a star cutout to the front. Cut strips of red, white and blue paper 5 inches to 6 inches in length. Make a hole in top of the mailing tubes' plastic lids with a nail. Stack the strips of paper together and insert into the holes. Fan papers out; fill the mailing tubes with candy or other favors. Replace the lids.
