Problems
Of course, the users have to read the training material; understandably, the reading can be monotonous. However, producing step-by-step videos for the purpose of instructing does not make economic sense. This is especially difficult if the user seeking assistance is extremely ill-informed.

Solution
An after-sales service team puts together technical demonstration online to explore and explain the problem. A panic button on the WEB site connects the client to a meeting room from where the presentation is made, simultaneously, by an agent. The agent might ask the client to go to a specific page of a knowledge database; for example, the one that describes step by step all the steps required to complete anoperation. Also, the usual questions, the FAQ (Frequently  Ask Questions), are put together on prerecorded help clips that the clients can consult, as free service, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  
    
Results 
The audio-visual is without doubt the most powerful of all media. The television and cinema are proof enough for this. The level of comprehension is manifestly superior as is the level of satisfaction of the clientele. By converting part of the technical assistance requests to self-service, the cost per client can be lowered, thus enabling more resources to be available for the more difficult cases. Thus, with us, long distance technical support, in telework, is available just a click away.
