Choosing a home theatre design can be difficult.  While the idea of having their own home theatre often brings a smile to a man's face, figuring out how to turn that vague notion into a clear mental picture that can be acted upon is an entirely different matter.  What makes things more difficult is that a perfect home theatre system for one house may not work well for another because of the design of the room, the acoustics of the area, the way the sound comes through the speakers, etc.  

For some individuals the task becomes so daunting that they choose to hire professionals.  It is possible to put together a great home theatre design, but there are a few things to consider in the planning process.

One thing right off the bat is to decide whether or not to use a professional.  There is nothing wrong with using a professional, in fact this industry has been booming because these individuals are trained to design a home theatre so that the sound and quality is the most efficient.  One prime example of how expertise can help is how the speakers are set up.  

Most individuals who set up their system have the speakers integrated near the television, as opposed to actually setting the speakers around the room to play surround sound.  Many individuals think they have a nice set up, and then jump half way to the ceiling when they hear surround sound for the first time and that creak behind the character sounds like it's coming from right over your shoulder behind you!

For others the problem with designing a home theatre starts in the beginning during the planning process.  One of the most important details that can not be overlooked for a perfect home theatre is making sure to choose the perfect room for it.  Maybe you have a furnished basement that works perfectly, or maybe it's too cramped. The living room sounds like a good idea, but how often is a living room designed well for a home theatre?  

The room design for your home theater is much more important than many people might think.  Looking good is important, but it's not nearly as important as having a system that is tuned in perfectly to blow away company with its awesome sound once the DVDs start playing.

The placement of furniture in the room is important as well.  The location of the speakers, television, and even the furniture all add to the home theater experience.  Where the speakers should be set up is partially determined by what type of chairs or couches you have, and where they are located in the room, as well.  Sure you want comfortable furniture, who doesn't?  But make sure they are comfortable and the right size to situate around the room, or else the home theatre you choose will not have its full effect.  Designing a home theatre system can be difficult, but if you mind the details and do your homework, the experience will make all the hassles worth the reward.
