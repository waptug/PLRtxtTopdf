How to Make Money with Outsourced Articles

Are you looking for ways to make money with outsourced articles online?  If so, you may be pleased with all of your options.

One of the most popular ways to make money with outsourced articles, which were written by a professional freelance writer, is to add those articles to your website.  Content filled websites are popular with internet readers.  

You can also add outsourced articles to your blog.  In fact, do you have a blog that accompanies your niche website?  If not, consider making one.  By cross promoting the two, you increase your chances of making money online.

As for how adding content to your website or blog makes you money, it depends on the type of website you operate.  Content filled websites will make money through advertisements.  If you have a product or a service online, you make money when a sale is made

To make the most money with outsourced articles, you will want to be cautious with what you order or buy prewritten.  Look for articles that are interesting to read, but look for those with important keyword phrases.  For example, a popular search phrase associated with eBay is “things to sell on eBay.”  Make sure popular keyword phrases, such as the previously mentioned example, are incorporated throughout each article.

As for why keywords are important, they can easily increase your search engine ranking.  The better your ranking, the easier it is to get visitors to your site.  Regardless of whether you make money selling a product or service or through the use of paid advertisements, traffic plays a huge role in the income you generate.  Your goal should be to get your website to appear on the first pages of Google, Yahoo, and MSN with applicable keywords.

Another way that you can make money with the use of outsourced articles is by submitting those articles to article directories.  As previously stated, with the proper articles, the search engines will automatically find your website, but additional marketing is needed to maximize your earnings.  You can post your bought articles on article directories with a link back to your website.  This helps to generate additional visits to your website, which, in turn, may result in income for you.

Using outsourced articles to promote a website or blog that sells a product, service, or makes money through advertisements is nice, but you may not see income right away.  This is particularly true with advertisements and affiliate programs, as it can take you up to year to starting making money.  If you don’t want to wait that long, consider reselling your outsourced articles.

If you are interested in reselling articles that you paid to have written, it is important to acquire exclusive rights.  This means that the writer cannot use your articles again.  Most legitimate freelance writers wouldn’t do so anyways, but it is still recommended that you set this rule.  This prevents you from running into trouble when trying to resell the articles later on.

Since your goal is to profit from the sale of these articles, you need to sell them for an amount higher than you paid.  Although it can be a time consuming process, you are urged to setup your own website.  Remember, you can market this website by using article directories or a blog.  Also, visit internet marketing forums online and add a link to your website in your signature.  Those looking for internet marketing tips on these forums can benefit from the purchase of your articles.  

When looking to resell outsourced articles that you own, it is recommended that you avoid third party marketplaces.  These websites are convenient, as you do not have to market your own website or pay for web hosting, but you are charged a fee.  Usually, that fee will prevent you from making a significant profit.

As you can see, there are a number of different ways that you can make money with the use of outsourced articles.  What is ideal about doing so is that you can legitimately profit from articles that you own, but didn’t write yourself.
