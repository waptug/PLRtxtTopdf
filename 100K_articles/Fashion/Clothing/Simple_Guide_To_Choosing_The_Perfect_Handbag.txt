As a lady you should pay a lot of attention to choosing the perfect handbag for any occasion. Handbags, for ladies like you, are very important items. It has become very rare these days to see ladies without their handbags. Many ladies have different handbags for different occasions, for different dresses, etc. 

It is important however for you to choose the right handbag for any occasion you are attending. This is because the right or wrong choice of handbag can make or mar any occasion you are going for. 

Below are some guides for choosing the perfect handbag-

Choose a handbag that goes with your dressing. Don't get handbags that look very odd with your dressing. Your handbag should help to complement your dressing and bring it out, and not to make it look odd.

Note that when you use your handbag, it is not only you who is aware. There are other people, especially ladies, around who will take notice of you. So, if your handbag looks odd, they will notice this and it could give a very negative impression about you. Try to prevent this, before it happens.

Choose a handbag that fits your figure. Don't go for handbags that don't fit your figure because they will make you look weird. Imagine a slim lady carrying very big handbags, or a big lady carrying very tiny handbag. This will not look fine at all. It is important that you know this and choose the right handbag that will fit your figure. 

Before buying any handbag at a store, make sure you try it out with the dressing you want to use it with. This will give you an idea of how it will look with your figure and your dressing, before you go ahead to buy it.

But if you go out and buy the handbag to take home before testing it out, you might be disappointed when you discover it doesn't look fine with your figure or the particular dressing you have chosen it for
