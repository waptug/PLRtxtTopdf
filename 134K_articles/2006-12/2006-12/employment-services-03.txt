I was so excited the first day I went looking for a job. I was 18 years old and a senior in high school. Up until then, my mother refused to let me work. She said that being a kid was about school, and that's what I needed to focus on. I hardly complained. Anyway, I soon found an open position just for me at a video store known as Blockbuster. This sounded perfect. I loved movies and I knew everything about them. I would excel at this job. After a few days, I soon realized that being employed was not all it was cracked up to be. I didn't want this job after all. A couple weeks down the road I quit and went looking for a new job. I guess that's pretty typical when you're a kid. If it were only so simple when you reached true adulthood. You know the one where you literally have to pay all the bills. Suddenly employment is mandatory. You don't always have the benefit of just quitting. One thing I am grateful for is the employment services at our fingertips now days. At least we can find a job faster.
