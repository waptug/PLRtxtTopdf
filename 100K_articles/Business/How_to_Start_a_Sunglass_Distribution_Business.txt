-----Business Overview: Distribute Sunglasses to Convenience Stores, Supermarkets and Clothing Shops full time or part time.-----

---What do you need to get started? #1 You need sunglasses.  You can’t do it without sunglasses! #2 You could use displays but you don’t really need them to start.  These are sunglass displays that hold from 12 to 50 sunglasses.  They can be quite expensive so you might as well start without them, at least for now.

---How much are the sunglasses? Your cost for these sunglasses is about $1 and you can sell them from $2 to $6 depending on where you are in the country.  You also have to consider if it’s sunny all the time in your town.  For example, I live in San Diego where it is sunny even in winter so you can sell sunglasses year round and sell a lot more in summer.  On the other hand, it’s a large city and a lot of people sell sunglasses here.  I sold them anywhere from $2.50 to $6.00, depending on the style and the type of store.

---How much money can you make? This depends on how much time you have and how much money you want to make.  If you are only working weekends you can only manage a few customers per week.  With sunglass accounts you have to visit them once a week to every three weeks, depending on the population of your town, how sunny it is in your part of the world and the size of your customer’s stores.

This is a good rule of thumb. If you only sell sunglasses you will be able to visit at least 20 stores per day if they all buy merchandise with a maximum of 35 stores per day.  This is normal for a route type of business like this one.  Believe me, 35 is not a lot of stores.  Once you get to your route all the stores are in the same street or a few blocks away from each other.

So let’s say that you only work on Saturday and you visit stores once per week during summer.  If you sell an average of just 8 sunglasses per store in just 20 stores you will sell 160 sunglasses.  If you sell them at $3 a pair, buy them for $1 you will make $2 a pair or a total of $320 for one day of work.

Want to make more? Then work more days! Sell other products, you can easily sell $1,000, $2,000 or more per day and you could make 30% to 50% profit.

---Benefits of selling sunglasses

-You don’t really need to buy displays from the start.  Many stores already have their own displays.   -Sunglasses are very inexpensive and they have a huge mark-up.   -If you give good service you will keep customers for a long time. -Sunglasses are small so you don’t need a van or truck.  You can use your car.   -You don’t need any storage or office either.  You can keep a few hundred sunglasses in a small corner of your house or even in the closet. -Shipping is not expensive because sunglasses are very light.
