\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 ATV\u8217
\'92s were developed for use in agriculture, for hauling equipment and traveling
 around farm property. They have since evolved into a hobby for many people and 
are now even used for racing. People love the excitement that ATV\u8217\'92s provide
 and the vast array of terrain that ATV\u8217\'92s open up for exploring. ATV\u8217
\'92s can provide a lot of enjoyment for riders and be a worthwhile activity. ATV
\u8217\'92s can also be dangerous, especially for children. Adults are often injured
 when they loose control of an AT and children have even less skill and experience
 than adults. This is not to say that children should not be allowed to ride an 
ATV, but they must follow strict safety rules in order to avoid injury.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Children 
should be taught that an ATV is not a toy and should be operated with care and with
 safety in mind. They should be made aware of all the safety rules and never allowed
 to ride without supervision. If children realize how dangerous ATV\u8217\'92s can
 be and what they must do to stay safe, they will be at a much lower risk of injury
.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 The best 
thing you can do for your child before they are allowed to ride is send them to 
an approved ATV training course. Many places require riders under 16 to take a training
 course before they can legally ride which is a good idea anyway even if your area
 does not require it. You should attend the training course with your child so that
 you are also familiar with ATV safety and can enforce the safety rules your child
 learned.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Another important
 safety practice for you and your child is riding the correct sized ATV. Children
 should never ride an adult sized ATV, as they are usually too large for them to
 comfortably operate and increase the likely hood of injury. If you are going to
 purchase your child an ATV make sure you get a youth sized ATV that is not too 
large for your child. You should also consider the engine size as a more powerful
 engine means a faster ATV. Children should only drive an ATV that they can handle
. \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Wearing appropriate
 safety gear is also an important part of ATV safety. Children should always wear
 helmets, gloves, goggles, long pants and a long sleeved shirt. Most places require
 helmet use by law but even if they do not a helmet should always be worn. Using
 safety gear will prevent many injuries that can occur when riders fall. Make sure
 that the safety equipment you purchase for your child fits properly and is of high
 quality. You should make sure that the safety gear your child uses is rated for
 ATV use.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 The last 
thing you should always do to keep your child safe, is to inspect their ATV before
 each use. Teach your child how to inspect their ATV as well and you can then both
 make sure it stays in good working condition and will not break or malfunction 
during use. If you and your child follow these safety tips, your child will have
 a safe and enjoyable time with their ATV.\par}
