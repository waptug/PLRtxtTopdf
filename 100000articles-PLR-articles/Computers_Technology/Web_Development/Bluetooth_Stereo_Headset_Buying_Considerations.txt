Riding the wave of the newest, hot technological item of the early 21st century doesn't stop with the Bluetooth stereo headset. Now, Bluetooth capabilities offer more services and gadgets than ever before, including a Bluetooth stereo headset. When looking for a stereo headset, many major brands offer nice selections, but none so nice as those offered by Motorola.

Motorola is taking the lead when it comes to designing attractive and spiffy gadgets to complement Bluetooth wireless connectivity. Coming soon from Motorola is a behind the head, sleek, Bluetooth stereo headset that will allow users to wirelessly control music and telephone calls using a system of touch controls on the side of the headband. Another creation that will soon be released for public consumption is the SoundPilot Headphones. This Bluetooth stereo headset and controller will allow users to use their own headphones to both accept calls and listen to music no matter where it's stored; on the computer, phone or other Bluetooth compatible device.

On the market now is a Bluetooth stereo headset called the Bluetooth DJ S805 headphones. These headphones look more like traditional, padded, wireless headphones that incorporate noise reduction and a wind resistant microphone to allow easy conversations no matter where you are or what you were listening to before you were interrupted. Also available now is the HT820 Bluetooth stereo headset, also designed to fit behind the head and over the ear. Both telephone and music capabilities are blended with this option as well, and music automatically stops when the headset receives an incoming call. After the conversation is completed, music will automatically resume. It doesn't get much better than that.

Bluetooth stereo headset adapters are readily available and can easily slide into any available USB port on laptops or computers, enabling users to stream their favorite music directly from your home stereo or computer speakers. The most popular adaptor is the Motorola Stereo PC Adaptor PC850. Compatible with any Bluetooth stereo headset, this gadget is a must have for Bluetooth fans. The also popular Bluetooth Stereo PC adaptor D200 is a handy choice for those who want to turn their computer into a wireless music system. Both PCs and Macs accept this adaptor to wirelessly stream music from PC to headset with little fuss.

And, check this out. Motorola has the leading edge on wearable Bluetooth technology. Bluetooth stereo headset capabilities just took a leap into the future with ROKR Bluetooth stereo headset eyewear, designed especially for today's always-on-the-go consumers. Of course, Bluetooth stereo headset accessories are also available for vehicles and office use as well. Experts in consumer electronics have predicted that within another five years, new cars will have built-in Bluetooth technology incorporated into their designs. The Bluetooth stereo headset has and will continue to be on the cutting edge of wireless connectivity, but be prepared to see different designs and models explode into the consumer market as technology continues to advance full speed ahead. One thing is certain; since the Bluetooth stereo headset is becoming so commonplace, where's yours?
