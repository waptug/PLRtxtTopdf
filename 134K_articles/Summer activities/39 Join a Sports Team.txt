Join a Sports Team

Kids love to play with other kids.  Joining a sports team will give them the opportunity to 
play with other kids, learn the rules of a sport, and have some structured play time.  All of 
this while giving mom and dad a break.

There are sports camps and teams that children can join when they are as young as three 
years old.  The age and type of sport they join will dictate the time commitment needed 
and the cost.

Have a discussion with your older children about what kind of sports they are interested 
in and what is available.  Find out if they want to play on a team or if they would prefer 
to play a game that they are on their own.

Summer sports played in teams:

*	Baseball
*	Soccer
*	Lacrosse

Summer sports played individually or in pairs:

*	Tennis
*	Swimming
*	Track and Field
*	Golf

Being active and having fun should be the goal of any sport your child chooses.  Make 
them give it a chance but if they aren’t having fun try and find something where they 
will.

If joining a sports team is too expensive or the availability isn’t there, consider starting a 
sports day or night in the neighborhood.  Talk to some other parents and go to a local 
park or a volunteer’s backyard to let the kids play.  You can set-up official teams or be 
more casual and let the kids have fun while learning the rules of the game.  With this 
option, you can choose a different for each week of the summer or rotate between a few 
favorites.

Not all kids are into sports, so don’t push it.  Some kids can be just as happy to come 
along and be the cheerleaders, join them and think up some fun cheers to encourage all of 
the players.
