Article Body:
A Runtime Error is an error that occurs during the execution of a program.
"Runtime Error" is a very generic error message and is usually accompanied by additional information, such as "Runtime Error 6507."
The opposite of a runtime error is a compile time error. Compile time errors occur as a program is being compiled from source code into executable code.
Runtime errors can occur for an inexhaustable number of reasons. These include bugs in the original program, hardware failure, operator error, and resource exhaustion
To properly troubleshoot a runtime error you will need additional information, such as: 
•	An error number 
•	Where you were in the program with the error occurred 
•	What you did just before the error occurred 
•	What you say just before and just after the error occured 
•	The state of the machine when the error occurred (memory, disk, and cpu usage)
