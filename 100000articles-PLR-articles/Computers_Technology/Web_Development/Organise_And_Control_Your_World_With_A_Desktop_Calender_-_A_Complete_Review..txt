I used to have an old paper desktop calendar, which seemed to have everything that I needed. I could timetable important dates and appointments in my desktop calendar, and each day had a funny and interesting quotation which would provide food for thought, as well as a pleasant moment or two of distraction. But, for many people (and I include myself in this group) there simply is more required nowadays than a paper 2006 desktop calendar can provide. That is why you should get an active desktop calendar for your computer screen.

Desktop calendars are invaluable sources of organization for any modern executive, or really anyone who is computer literate and wants to make their life more organized and efficient. Computer desktop calendars allow you all of the functions imaginable, and many of them are free, or at least quite reasonable. Using a desktop calendar, you can schedule anything that is upcoming weeks or years in advance, and set it to remind you with tones when the time comes. If you do use your computer on a daily basis, there is simply no reason why you should not use an active desktop calendar for all of your secretarial needs, as it is much better than the old paper standbys, and you can not lose it.

There are, however, some problems with switching from paper calendars to electronic ones. One of them is that a desktop calendar is not moveable. Although the old style of desktop calendars were not moveable either, they did allow an easy way to add important notes that you took when out. You could simply tape them to the day when you got home, which was much easier than having to boot up the calendar and type it in, I am sure that you will agree. And, if your hard drive goes, your paper 2006 desktop calendar is still there, while your computer calendar, along with all record of your important appointments has gone for good into the computer happy hunting ground. That is a quite unfortunate event, I am sure that you will agree. Another problem with these new styles of desktop calendars is that they can be disturbed by Windows events. If your computer were to install some updates and reboot itself, you could be completely out of luck. If the desktop calendar did not reboot correctly, it would not remind you of all of your important appointments.
