Our 2006 Summer has finally arrived, and for all the costume party enthusiasts that just can’t wait for Fall for Halloween to arrive once again, you may be searching for some really cool adult costume ideas for your next hot summer shindig!

The BBQ is ready, the burgers are seasoned, but you want to add a little more pizzazz to your outdoor summer party. So you decide to throw a costume party, but where do you begin? I will help you with some fun ideas that will have your guests requesting a costume encore party for many summer seasons to come.

Throwing a home and backyard costume party is a great way to entertain your guests, and is a fantastic way for new people to meet other individuals in a fun and interactive environment. 

If you have gone to a get-together in the past where you don’t know many people, it can sometimes be very awkward, but when you create an interactive theme and add fun costumes, everyone can play the part, plus it allows all the guests to mingle comfortably in a unique non-stressful atmosphere.

Before sending out your invitations, you want to create a costume theme that is not difficult to achieve, and does not cost a lot of money. Some of the most popular theme parties in the past have been Hawaiian, Mardi Gras, Masquerade parties, but how about you get a little more creative and think of something that may not have been done yet, and if you’re having some difficulty coming up with any ideas, let me help you!

<b>If You And Your Guests Love Movies, Fantasy, And Adult Party Themes, Read On!</b>

When organizing a birthday party for children, it’s usually very simple and most kids enjoy being a clown, cowboy & cowgirl, or their favorite sci-fi characters. However, for adults you want to create a little more stimulation for the guests, and create that party theme that people just want to be a part of and talk about for weeks on end afterwards.

How do you go about creating this knockout theme party you ask? It’s simple! First you have to understand the type of guests you are going to invite, and then tailor the theme around what they like and their personalities. 

This will determine how risky or tame your adult costume party will turn out to be. You don’t want to go too crazy if you happen to invite your parents, or future In-laws, and you don’t want to go to soft if you have a wild group of friends that like to go all out!

<b>Adult Fun Starts With A Unique Theme And What You Create Around It</b>

Once you determine your guests’ character traits, your next step is to find decorations, and also have your food complement the theme of your party. So you have a wild bunch of partiers? How about having a “Saran Wrap Party”! This one is easy, all you have to do is get all your guests to arrive wearing only Saran Wrap, and they can get as creative as they like, or they can be as revealing as they feel comfortable with. How about having a backyard beach party with a twist. All the men have to wear a one or two-piece women’s bathing suit, and the women have to wear men’s attire such as board shorts and beach shirts. 

Now I know you may be asking where the fun is for the women wearing guys attire. The whole purpose is to get the guys in those g-string bikinis and create a really funny atmosphere. The men will be feeding off the humour and the women will feel less intimidated and possibly more open to the environment when meeting new guys at your party.

Whatever you decide to do, have fun and use your imagination. Get balloons, streamers, and lots of fun decorations, because they will really add to your theme and party atmosphere. 

If you need to find costumes and accessories, and you just don’t have the time to drive all over town to find something really cool, consider many of the online costume shops that are offering fantastic summer deals! This is the best time to find what you need, because it’s not as busy as the fall season, and you will get your selected items quickly, and just in time for your next summer costume bash. Good luck and have fun!
