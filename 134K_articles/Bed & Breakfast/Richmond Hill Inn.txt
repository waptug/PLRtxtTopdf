Richmond Hill Inn

Romance isn't hard to come by at the Richmond Hill Inn located in Asheville, North Carolina.  Nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Inn features 37 well-appointed rooms in the historic Mansion, Croquet Cottages, and Garden Pavilion. The focus in on the main building, a Queen Anne style mansion originally built in 1889.

Enjoy the serenity and beauty of Victorian gardens with waterfalls, a mountain brook, and spectacular flower displays. After your complimentary breakfast, explore Biltmore Estate, the Blue Ridge Parkway, or downtown Asheville.
Located inside the Mansion and on a national scale known for its ground-breaking cuisine and all-embracing wine selection, Gabrielle's restaurant is one of the few restaurants in the state to be given the esteemed AAA Four Diamond Award every year.
Woven amongst the buildings are six acres of stunning Victorian gardens bordering an added forty wooded acres with walking trails. The formal Parterre Garden at the Garden Pavilion is formed after the great parterres of the Victorian age uncomplicated, geometrically landscaped gardens with paths between the beds.
Beginning just off the porch of the Mansion and cascading downward the natural slant of the grounds into a succession of tiny pools, the mountain brook flows to a nine-foot waterfall in the Parterre Garden. Take pleasure in the panoramic view of the Parterre Garden from the lofty terrace that sits on top of the waterfall. On the other side of the terrace, look at Japanese koi fish swimming in the middle of water plants in a pool. Sitting in close proximity to the waterfall and listening to the resonance of rushing water, it's hard to envision a more peaceful background.
The Richmond Hill Inn is a must visit place for anyone seeking a peaceful vacation hideaway, complete with all the finest gardens to be found in North Carolina.
