French Creek Ranch

Custer, South Dakota, is home to the rustic French Creek Ranch Bed and Breakfast. As expected from this part of the country, you won't find frills and lace here.  What you will find is a laid-back place with plenty of comfort and the great outdoors.  There are not many bed and breakfasts where you can bring your own horse and have it taken care of during your stay.  At the French Creek Ranch, your horse will be pampered as much as you are.

French Creek Ranch offers quiet privacy yet easy access to the countless wonders of the Black Hills. The ranch sits in a high mountain meadow with French Creek running through it overlooking the awesome views of the nearby Needles formation.

French Creek Ranch is adjacent to the Black Hills National Forest, allowing hikers, bicyclists or horse riders easy access to the Forest's thousands of acres. And by traveling just a short distance, guests can access beautiful mountain bike trails. Other nearby attractions include the Crazy Horse Memorial, Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument and of course, Mount Rushmore.

There are three guest rooms to choose from.  The Cowboy Room is Rustic Western themed, with queen-size lodge-pole bed, private bath just across the hall, large walk-in closet, and a beautiful view of nearby Needles. The Cowgirl Room is Southwestern themed, queen bed, private bath, walk-in closet, and a gorgeous view of the Hills. The Lakota Room is American Indian themed room with queen bed, private bath, double closet and a garden view.

A full breakfast, ranging from traditional ranch breakfasts to innovative Southwestern entrees, is served every morning at 8 a.m. in the Ranch's main dining room.  Horse guests get a wondrous meal of fresh oats. For a stay a bit out of the ordinary, visit French Creek Ranch.
