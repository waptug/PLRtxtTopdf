The Downloads

Downloading media to your MP3/iPod has been around for many years, it's just as old as the MP3players them self's. Finding the resource that allows you to get this exciting content is the big issue among iPod/MP3 owners.

iPod MP3 down loads are becoming hugely popular these days, because they allow several songs or pieces of audio to be stored without occupying a large amount of storage space also allowing you to download whatever you want.

The Numbers Are Large

There are about 110 million active iPod/MP3 users world wide. Did you know the average iTunes member down loads a minimum of 300 songs and 20 movies a year. That's $500 a year on just down loads. WOW! Did you also know that iTunes is losing customer's and members by the hundreds each and every year. It won't take you long to figure that one out. These people are exploring their options.

The iPod MP3 Download Resource

You must know that there is no such thing as free iPod MP3 music downloads. You may have seen such sites advertised that way, but the truth is they all want you to purchase a membership fee in order to gain access to the free MP3 down loads. So why advertise FREE when all you have to say is " You Can Get Access To Over 300 Million iPod MP3 Downloads For As Low As $34.95". The price is completely worth the package deal and has been satisfying customer's worldwide.

Imagine being able to download anything you want anytime you want. Movies, Music, Games, & everything else. Just imagine the possibilities of unlimited access. You would never have to pay each time you want to download your favorite song, like the hit new single by AKON and definitely never pay month by month. Now that sounds very tempting.

Take Me To The Source

Another thing to keep in mind is there are some MP3 sites out there that offer this very rewarding feature. However, you need to be cautious, as they are illegal and could potentially get you into big trouble. Honestly, you don't want the law knocking down your door because you download some MP3 Downloads, do you?. Of course not. Typically the best way to get around this issue, is to find an MP3 Download review site of your choice. Allowing you to see what's hot, new and exciting in the MP3 down loads world.
