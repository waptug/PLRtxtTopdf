}What is the Cost of Air Ambulance Transport?\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 If you or
 someone you love will be needing air ambulance transportation in the foreseeable
 future, then it is time to start doing a little homework.  It is important to start
 compiling a list of air ambulance services that will be able to meet the needs.  
After comprising a list of potential air ambulance transport companies, it is time
 to compare costs.  Just like any other business or service, prices will vary.

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 There are
 many variables that can affect the cost of air ambulance transport.  You can receive
 quotes from contacting the air ambulance service company yourself or by contacting
 a broker.  Do be aware that the broker will find the lowest cost possible, then
 add an additional fee for his or her services to the cost.  Whenever possible, 
it is wise to deal directly with the air ambulance service company.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The type 
of aircraft needed for the transport will directly affect the cost of the air ambulance
 service.  It is important to know the distance of the flight before deciding on
 a specific type of aircraft.  Cost alone should not determine the aircraft used
 for transport of the patient.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Another factor
 that influences the cost of the air ambulance service is the number and type of
 medical staff needed for the flight.  If the patient requires two trained people
 on board, the cost may be dramatically less than a patient requiring an entire 
specialized medical team.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Frequently
, the cost of the air ambulance transport will include the fee for ground transportation
 to and from the aircraft.  This is commonly referred to as bedside to bedside service
.  Also, the cost often includes the cost of any additional passengers where applicable
.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Many  private
 insurance companies will cover the cost of air ambulance transportation if it is
 deemed to be medically necessary.  It is wise to check with your insurance provider
 before calling to make arrangements for the air ambulance transportation, if possible
.  If it is unable to prove coverage for the service before the time of the flight
, secured payment is usually required.  For most companies, acceptable forms of 
payment include major credit cards, wire transfers, certified checks, or money orders
 for the amount of the flight.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The actual
 cost of the air ambulance transport can range widely.  Typically, the fees run 
between $10,000 and $100,000. \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Due to the
 extreme expense of the air ambulance transport, it is advisable to compare costs
 whenever possible.  If the patient has insurance coverage, learn the facts about
 what air ambulance transportation costs are covered and under what conditions.  
Dealing directly with the air ambulance service company can be a method for saving
 money by doing a little research on your own.  A broker can locate air ambulance
 service, but will charge additional fees.  Be specific about details such as needed
 medical staff and type of aircraft when asking for quotes.  Also, learn what specifics
 are included in the cost when making the decision to select one air ambulance service
 company over another.  With a little research, patients and their family can get
 the best service at a great value.     }}
