Time passes and the digital photography has imposed itself almost totally, but what are we doing with our digital photographs, we can’t keep them in an album, then what? How can we get a digital photo frame display? Without a digital photo display you’ll face uncomfortable social situations.

 Do you open your computer every time grandma comes to visit and wants to see your last pictures? Or when your neighbors come to your place for a cup of coffee and a little chat about your last journeys, you run in your office open your computer and invite everyone inside?

Another option is to get your camera and gather everybody around you too see the pictures. No I don’t think this is the solution, not in a million years. 

Imagine your boss came at your place and started asking for photos from your last trip, what will you do? You will drag him to your computer?, show him a top of papers that looks something like pictures or make him stare to your small LCD camera screen.
	
I’m not trying to sell you anything but there is a solution to these embarrassing situations, use a digital photo frame display. It’s very fancy, has great colors, and you will never be embarrassed that your pictures are looking a little funny on paper.

You can treat your digital photo frame display like any regular picture. You can keep it on a wall or on a table. For changing pictures use an USB drive, or a CD or any kind of external support that works.

With a digital photo frame display, pictures can be shown each one of them separate one after another, or if you want easy searches I recommend the thumbnail mode. However here are the disadvantages of digital photo frame display

The size of this wonder album is a problem, you can’t find an every size piece, or at least not at a reasonable price if we can speak about something like that, because as we know there is no reasonable price for fancy toys like digital photo frame displays.

Besides the price there is another little problem: batteries. Digital photo frame display batteries last only for eight hours, to prevent digital photo frame displaying “black screen”, make sure you never forget about the batteries.

A nice, still expensive toy, the digital photo frame display catches more and more buyers, which in time also works wonders on the acquisition price.
