LimeWire is must-have software of MP3 enthusiast. It provides unlimited downloads and most specially, it is for free. Another way to download free MP3 is the use of µTorrent software. µTorrent is BitTorrent software that allows you to download from torrent files. It is Micro-Sized Yet Feature Filled. Most of the features present in other BitTorrent clients are present in µTorrent, including bandwidth prioritization, scheduling, RSS auto-downloading and Mainline DHT (compatible with BitComet). Additionally, µTorrent supports the Protocol Encryption joint specification (compatible with Azureus 2.4.0.0 and above, BitComet 0.63 and above) and peer exchange. Resource-Friendly, µTorrent was written with efficiency in mind. Unlike many torrent clients, it does not hog valuable system resources - typically using less than 6MB of memory, allowing you to use the computer as if it weren't there at all. Additionally, the program itself is contained within a single executable less than 220 KB in size. µTorrent also has support for localization, and with a language file present, will automatically switch to your system language. If your language isn't available, you can easily add your own, or edit other existing translations to improve them. Actively Developed and Improved, the developer puts in a lot of time working on features and making things user-friendlier.

It can be used to download single mp3 files but it can also be used to download albums or song collection of artists. µTorrent is for free and you can download it at its official website. A detailed guide on how to use µTorrent is also available at their website.
