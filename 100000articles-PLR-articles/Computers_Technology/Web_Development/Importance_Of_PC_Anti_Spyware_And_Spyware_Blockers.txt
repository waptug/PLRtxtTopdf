Anti Spyware and Spyware blockers and needed for PC systems for any person that wants to connect to the internet to access information. Most of us PC owners now know about software called Spyware that gets install on our computer systems by surfing the internet and some of you have Anti Spyware and Spyware blockers installed but how protected are you from these types of software? In most cases if you are running Windows XP or Vista you do have some protection from Windows defender which is now part of the operating system however this software only provides a limited amount of protection. It could be that you also got software with your PC or purchased some Anti Spyware with spyware blocker but how effective is this software now.

Let’s start out by review and going over what is spyware and how anti spyware and spyware blockers are still need to protect your computer and your personal information. Spyware and Adware, also called "Malware", are files made by publishers and marketers that allow them to snoop on your browsing activity, see what you search for and purchase and then will send you "pop-up" ads in most cases. In time they can slow down your PC, and cause issues with your PC and Internet browser and even cause the PC to crash. How Spyware impact your computers is that overtime as more and more of this type of software gets loaded on your computer it actively ties up your system processes and resources that leads to slower responses and often trying to go out and contact the host site it came from and in some cases it hijacks your browser to take you to other sites that you normally would not go to and this type of activity all affects your network connection due to the heavy traffic coming from your PC.

Spyware and Adware viruses have rapidly become the number one threat to your computer with over 87% of computers already infected. These include Popup Ads, Trojans, Worms, and Web Bugs, Web worms, Monitoring Software and more. Some of these types of software programs can monitor and record your online activities including your credit card numbers and bank account numbers along with other personal information and can lead to a worse possibly identity theft. If you use the internet like most people then there is a good chance you're PC is probably infected with these types files or will be since this can happen by simply surfing the Internet and going to websites, reading email, downloading music or other files that infect your PC without you knowing it. I think the worst case I have seen as an IT professional of this was one client’s PC had over 400 programs running actively in the back ground. Most of these types of software programs like hide and run in the back ground where you don’t see them normally unless it an actual Popup ad

With the current Anti Spyware and blockers combating these types of software there are now newer forms of this software which are worse and becoming more capable at evading detection. The latest threats are better than spyware from just a few months ago. So you’re current Anti Spyware and Spyware blocker programs may no longer be as effective at combating spyware or blocking spyware as it was in the past.

Fortunately there are newer Spyware and Adware virus removal tools available that help combat again these newer forms of Spyware software and helps block spyware. Sorting through them all to find the right one is a challenging task and an important decision to make. The best solution is to install the newer version Anti-Spyware that includes blocking spyware this software which not only will remove any program that might get installed but also is a blocks spyware these types of software from even getting installed.

Watch for compatibility since there are many types of software that does not run properly on Vista. But even with this Spyware is still a real issue and still can get installed on your computer system. So be aware of what you are accepting and clicking on since some sites will install these kinds of programs on your computer when you go to that site or accept their software or downloads.
