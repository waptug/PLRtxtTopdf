By continually  harassing your accountant about issues without giving them a reasonable amount of time to respond, will only decrease the communication and value between you and your accountant. 
	
Having a automatic system set up with your accountant will save you a great deal of time. Setting up automatic updates for your  accountant to send to you will provide you with the necessary information to see how all aspects of your financing are going while giving your  accountant a deadline to have these updates ready for you. This will eliminate stress or confusion regarding your finances for both you and your accountant and will be a mutual convenience.
	
The best way to bring out the best services in your accountant, is to properly pay them on time. By not paying your bill on time, you only guarantee that your accountant will not give any attention or regard to your requests. By paying your  accountant immediately or before the bill is due, you can expect the most attention and assistance form your  accountant. By being loyal and fulfilling your obligations to your accountant, you can expect your accountant to fulfill their obligations you.
