Learning a new language doesn't have to take hours each day. You'll find that most modern language courses understand how busy people are, so they create courses that require less than 20 minutes study time each day. I am sure you could spare 20 minutes a day out of your bust schedule to gain a new valuable skill. These short daily sessions help you retain more information and are a great way to keep you motivated. 

Have you ever thought about using your time more effectively? I am sure there are times during you day that you could fit in some extra French tuition. What about during your commute to work? Maybe even during your lunch break? Think about it? Could you squeeze in some extra French tuition into these times? Most modern courses can be purchased in CDs or MP3s formats. All you would need to do is upload the tracks onto your Ipod and take it to work! The last thing any of us want to do when you come home from work – is work some more. If you use your time more wisely you won't have to.    

Have you ever though about teaching yourself to learn French for free? I know it sounds crazy, but it's easy if you know how. The best way to start is to simply use your ears. Get on-line and listen to some French internet radio stations. The more you listen the more you'll realise the similarities between English and French. Before you know it you'll start to understand some of the things they are saying – you'll be amazed how quickly this will happen. Another great tip is to rent some French movies from your local library. All foreign movies now have English subtitles so it's understand what's being said.   

If you want to learn French very quickly then you may want to think about one 2 one French tuition. This can be quite expensive, but you will be able to speak and understand French in no time at all. If you are serious about learning another language, and are prepared to pay for it then this is definitely the way to go. A great less expensive alternative is to attend an evening class. You won't receive the same amount of individual attention, but expect to see some pretty impressive results in a relatively short amount of time.    

Hopefully my top four ideas on French tuition have enlightened you, and help you get a step closer to learning French.
