New Teacher, New Rules

	Oh, the first day of school.  The excitement and anticipation, the butterflies twirling in the stomach – and then you get to your class.  The teacher comes in and writes classroom rules down on the board.  She sends home information on her class discipline policy.  
	When our kids begin school, it can be an adjustment getting used to a new teacher.  We can help them make this time period easier by staying positive and making sure our comments are appropriate.  It might be an adjustment for us as well.  It’s important that you do not say anything negative in front of your children.  They will need to believe that it will be okay, and you don’t want it repeated back to the teacher.
	Help your child by reviewing the rules with them and talking about them.  Make sure they understand what the teacher is saying.  My daughter’s teacher had a rule that the children could not go to the office to call their parent if they were not feeling well.  My daughter was afraid that if she got sick she would have to stay at school.  What the teacher was trying to say is that if a child gets sick, they need to go to the nurse’s station.  They can decide from there if a parent should be called.
	If there is a rule that no gum is allowed in school, make sure your child is not chewing gum on the way to school.  They might forget to spit it out.  If they can’t wear a certain type of shoe, remind them to leave them at home.  We should help our children remember and obey the rules.  These rules will help them learn that there are boundaries and guidelines in school, and in life.
