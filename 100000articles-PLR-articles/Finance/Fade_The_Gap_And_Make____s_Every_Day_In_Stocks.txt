Here are some of the emails I have received from Avery recently:

1) See all the gaps that have filled within 30 minutes

2) Even where the gap hasn't filled, there's money to be made
What I mean by statistics is how many times during the last 100 days a stock has gone up at list $.10, $.20, ... $1.00 or more from open to high:

Mark, I like to keep things simple... 1000 shares * $.12 profit / share = $120. After commissions, I net $100.  Basically, this is a $100 bill printing press.

See all those filled gaps?!?!?!

You would have made over $1.00 per share on every trade! The QQQQ doesn't count, I just use it to gauge the market. But it, too, filled the gap...LOL!

Compare the middle indicator to before... see how much trading each cross can net you?

It really is simple, Mark. I think you can "feel" it... can't you?

Hi Mark:

1) Let's say a trader starts with $25,000 and trades 1000 shares. If the trader nets $100 a day pretax on ONE TRADE, with 22 trading days a month that's $2,200 in about 30 minutes or less per day.

Ok..that’s enough for now. I have picked The Rumpled One’s mind clean over the past week nailing down his “fade the gap method.” I am actually amazed he gave away so much information so freely.
