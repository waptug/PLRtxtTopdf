}Are ATV\u8217\'92s too Dangerous for Kids?\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 An ATV is
 not a toy and is a machine that should be respected and taken seriously, or the
 potential for injury is great. It is true that many ATV injuries occur every year
, especially with children. When children do not wear protective gear, are not supervised
, and do not ride in a safe manner, the potential for injury is great. However, 
with the proper precautions the chances for injury are greatly reduced. ATV\u8217
\'92s are not too dangerous for children, providing that you and your child take
 the necessary safety precautions. If your child does not have the right attitude
 towards ATV\u8217\'92s, they do not wear safety gear, and are not supervised while
 riding, then yes, an ATV is too dangerous for them. But, if you plan on teaching
 your child safe driving practices, have them wear safety gear, and supervise them
, an ATV can be a safe and enjoyable pastime.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 One of the
 most important things you can do to keep your child safe on an ATV is to teach 
them safety practices and give them the right attitude about ATV\u8217\'92s. If 
you assume that your child will not view an ATV as a toy and will drive it responsibly
 without any instruction, you are probably asking for trouble. Taking an ATV safety
 course with your child is a great way to tech them safe driving practices, and 
in many places it is required before your child can ride. Never assume that your
 child will be responsible right off the bat, they need to be taught how to responsibly
 drive and supervised to make sure they follow safety protocol. If you drive an 
ATV as well, you should try to set a good example by always wearing your safety 
gear and riding safely.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 If your child
 does not wear safety gear, then an ATV is too dangerous for them. Many ATV injuries
 involving children are preventable if the child had been wearing safety gear. Everyone
 who rides an ATV should always wear a helmet, goggles, and gloves. The best way
 to get your child to wear safety gear is to wear it yourself and set a good example
. Durable pants and a jacket designed for ATV riding are also a good idea as they
 can protect from scrapes and abrasions. If you do not intend to enforce the use
 of safety gear, then do not get your child an ATV as unprotected rides face the
 biggest risk of injury.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 While there
 are many injuries involving kids and ATV\u8217\'92s, with the proper precautions
 they are not too dangerous for kids. As long as kids know the rules of safe driving
 and obey them, they should stay safe. It is a parent\u8217\'92s responsibility 
to keep their kids safe and to always supervise them. If you do not think your child
 is mature enough to handle the responsibility of safe driving, wait until they 
are older to get them an ATV. Kids should only drive an ATV that is the correct 
size and should always be supervised. If kids follow the rules and parents enforce
 them, ATV riding can be fun and safe.\par}
