When was the last time your computer or the internet or life for that matter was working too good? Never right? My point is that we stop being successful in anything that we do if we sit back and let things come to us. There is no secret way to have success without working for it. The work is to always be improving. So what does this have to do with computers and memory upgrade?

Well for one thing life in general is getting more and more to be computer run. If you don't update your technology or do memory upgrade fast enough you can be in the "dark ages," before you notice. Even personal computers have large hard drives and very fast processor speeds, and it is making a huge difference in the productivity of people in this day and age. Whether you are a internet shopper, or a database guru, or a writer, or gamer, or researcher, the tools that you have with computers are essential to doing the amount of work that you are able to do.

So how do you improve your productivity? Well there are three basic ways that come to mind: 1) buy the latest and greatest computer on the market to get all of the newest technologies, 2) you can make sure a virus isn't causing problems, 3) memory upgrade -- go out and buy extra memory and either put it yourself for free (not recommended) or let an expert do it, or 4) you can buy software that can analyze your computer make suggestions, changes, repairs, etc. in order to increase efficiency. It is this last method that I want to talk about more.

Basically efficiency software is the best overall option for several reasons. First it is cheaper than buying all new equipment or even buying extra memory cards (especially if you are having someone install them for you). This kind of "memory upgrade"--that is buying efficiency software--is also a heck of a lot easier. Basically if you can put a CD into a CD-drive you can run this software. It automatically searches and analyze your entire system and it does all this fast. It also stays on your computer and suggests things to increase efficiency in your every day operations. It really is like hiring your own 24-7 support tech. It allows you to avoid all the hassles of going out and buying another system, then setting it all up the way you want it and need it, then transferring all of your valuable information to it, and on and on. You don't have to learn how to build a computer and find out where the memory cards go. You don't have to risk zapping a motherboard with a simple thing like static electricity. Take it from me, it saves you a lot of time and hassle.

So if this alternative to memory upgrade sounds good to you, you should do a search either for memory upgrade or for efficiency software. There is a wealth of information waiting for you to learn and to make the correct decision in this battle against time we call productivity.
