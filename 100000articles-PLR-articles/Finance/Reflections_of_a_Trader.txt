I must admit I love trading. I have loved it all my life. When I was about 8 years old I learned what the stock market was, I don't remember how I first learned of it. I do remember asking my Uncle about it all the time. I suppose he may have introduced it to me. He showed me how to interpret the stock prices, that were published in the newspaper daily. No internet back then.

Apparently, I must have made an impression on him, because for my ninth birthday he bought me one share of Mead Paper Company. My first share of stock, he explained to me, that this meant that I owned a small piece of the company. That was it, a fire was lit in me that burns to this day.

My Uncle passed away in 1988, at the young age of 37. By this time I was 18, I had not talked to him in a few years about the markets. He moved around alot, and he was in failing health the last three years of his life. Back then, I thought his knowledge of the stock market was boundless. Looking back today, I realize that wasn't the case. He he did have dreams, and those dreams still live today through me. I am grateful that he took the time to pass them on.

Today, I trade E-minis and Currencies. I truly think that for some folks, this is the best job on the planet. I know it is for myself. I have'nt become Peter Lynch or Warren Buffet, heck I'm probably closer to Jimmy Buffett. One thing is still true, I am as passionate about trading today as I was 30 Years ago.

One thing has changed now though, I feel stronger about introducing others to trading, than I do about actually trading for myself. Looking back, that may have been my Uncles' passion also. Not the trading, but the sharing.
