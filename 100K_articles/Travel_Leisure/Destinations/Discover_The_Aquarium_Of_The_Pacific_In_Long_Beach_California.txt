The Aquarium provides behind the scenes tours where you can dive into the underwater world and discover places in the Aquarium where most people do not have a chance to go and even feed the anamals. Visitors are encouraged to watch animal feedings and learn more about the animals and environmental issues at habitat presentations. Join the Animal Encounter interactive program which allows guests to feed, touch, and go behind the scenes with some of the more than 12,500 inhabitants, including the Shark Animal Encounter which provides guests with an opportunity to be in a pool with one of the zebra sharks, or maybe even the 240-pound thorny ray. 
From Memorial Day through Labor Day you can aboard The Conqueror, a 90-foot research vessel for a 90-minute marine science excursion where you will have an opportunity to touch a variety of marine animals while you learn about their natural habitat and about life in the ocean.
