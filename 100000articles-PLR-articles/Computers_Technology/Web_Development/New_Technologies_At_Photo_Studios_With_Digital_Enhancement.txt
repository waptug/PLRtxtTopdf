Print quality, or resolution, is measured in terms of dots per inch (dpi). This is the number of dots that can fit into a line one inch long. Naturally, higher dpi equals higher resolution and sharper photos, text and graphics. So, if sharp photo detail and crisp laser-quality text is important to you, look for a printer with a minimum of 1200x1200 dpi. However, there are other important factors to consider when achieving ultimate print quality. Choosing between ink or laser color printing used to be pretty easy for most people, color laser printers were just too expensive, and an alternative were photo studios with digital enhancement. 

When making your decision, consider the following:

Paper sizes and types will work on the majority of printers available, as many inkjet printers are very flexible and can provide accommodation from 4x6 photos to wide-format banner paper, and the whole variations in between. Laser printers are best for standard-size paper, such as 8.5x11 and 11x17 paper.

Also, you must look for high end photos, brochures and marketing materials. The advanced inks now available for inkjet printers provide the accurate detail, gloss uniformity, and regular results that high quality photos demand, for example, the wanes in photo studios with digital enhancement. 

If you are printing photos to keep as family heirlooms or high end home business marketing objects such as brochures, an inkjet printer is the best choice for this specific job, more like the ones at photo studios with digital enhancement 

Many printers include a standard paper tray capable of holding 100 sheets of paper at a time. How much printing do you do and on what kind of paper size? How many sheets do you use for a typical project, and how many copies or sets do you need is the questions you need to be thinking about.
 
However, laser printers also deliver high-quality and color matching. And, because of their higher speeds and lower cost per page, they may be your best choice if you need high volume color printing like the ones at photo studios with digital enhancement.

In your search, you should find documents with finishing requirements. Laser printers generally have more paper management options, such as high volume trays, duplexers and staplers. Print and copy speed refers to how many black or color text pages can be printed or copied in one minute. This rate is calculated in pages per minute and copies per minute. But in the end, it’s up to you to decide what is more important to you based on the type of printing you want to do, even if it’s not like the wanes at photo studios with digital enhancement.
