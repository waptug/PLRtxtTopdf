When decorating a home or office, many people turn to the most popular and expensive stores to find pieces of art work to add to their space. And while this is a great way to decorate and to support your local art industry, it can be costly and make your home or office look just like everyone elses. A solution: make some of your own art work to display proudly in the places your love. 

Making your own art work might sound daunting or unrealistic, but it doesn't have to. It can be much easier and more fun than you think. One of the best things about creating your own art work is that it gives you endless options for decorating uniquely. Think about it: if you decorate your home or office using just what you find in stores it can be pretty hard to create a unique space or to have a finished product that is really you. Making your own art work solves those problems. Your art work allows you to make pieces that fit exactly into the plans and dreams you have for your home or office. 

Consider the home or office that you are decorating. Take time to dream about the possibilities and keep a list of what things you like and of what you hope your space will turn out to be like. Consider how a few well-made pieces of art work could add to the uniqueness and beauty of your space. Would a painting of a beach scene fit perfectly into your living room? Would a piece of pottery adorn your bookshelf in the perfect way? Don't let your lack of artistic abilities keep your mind from dreaming. At this point, consider all possibilities and leave worrying about the 'how' for later. 

Gather ideas for your art work from as many sources as you can. Look in decorating magazines, in store catalogs, online, or even in the homes or offices of your friends. Keep your eyes peeled for ideas no matter where you are! The perfect piece of art work for your space could be similar to something you see with a few simple modifications. 

Once you have a few ideas about art work that could make your space beautifully unique for you, then begin the process of figuring out how you can make your art work. Perhaps it will be as easy as visiting a local art supply store to gather the right materials, or perhaps you will need to enroll in an art class or two. Whatever it takes, stick with it. Creating unique art work for your home or office will be worth it no matter what. Friends and family will marvel at the beauty of your space and at how perfectly it fits you.
