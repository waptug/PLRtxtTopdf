You went to college, and you have your degree. And now that you have a job, you are making your own money, which means you have your own bills to pay. College probably wasn't free, and it certainly wasn't cheap. You probably had to take out several student loans in order to pay for your tuition, books, even your living expenses. So now that you have graduated, you are faced with the prospect of paying back several loans at a time. This can be quite overwhelming. It can be difficult to keep track of several different monthly loan payments with different interest rates. That is why student loan debt consolidation is a good thing to consider.

When you consolidate your student loans, you are combining them into one loan. This has many benefits for you, including only 1 monthly payment rather than several to keep track of, and one low interest rate for the entire amount. Also, you can take longer to pay back the loan, which will help keep your monthly payments lower. In the long run, you will save money by choosing student loan debt consolidation, because you won't be paying several varying interest rates on several loans.

Another huge advantage of student loan debt consolidation is that it is beneficial to your credit rating. If you have several loan payments to keep track of and pay per month, the chances of you missing a payment are much higher than if you have just one loan payment to pay monthly. And missing student loan payments is nothing to mess around with. If you get behind on your loan payments, you run the risk of having property and possessions revoked, and your credit rating will be damaged for a very long time. Therefore, if you are someone who might not be able to keep track of several student loans at a time, you should consider student loan debt consolidation!

Going through the student loan debt consolidation process is not difficult, and takes very little time on your part. There are many reputable lenders (especially on the Internet) that will help you through the process, either online or over the phone. Once you choose a consolidation company to handle your loans, the process usually doesn't take any longer than 45 days (you should continue to pay your loan payments until the consolidation is final). How a student loan debt consolidation works is the consolidation company pays the balance on all of your existing student loans, and then lumps the entire balance of them into one loan. Then an interest rate is determined. Usually, this is based on an average of the interest rates for your previous student loans. The advantage, though, is that once an interest rate is locked in, the rate remains unchanged until the balance is paid off. With unconsolidated loans, the interest rate is subject to rise ever July.

Student loan debt consolidation seems like an ideal way to pay back your student loans in a manageable and responsible way. You only have to deal with one lender, you only have to deal with one low interest rate, and you only have to deal with one monthly payment. And, you will save money in the long run, because you are not paying the extra amounts in interest that you would be paying if you did not consolidate. In addition, your credit rating will remain at a good level, which you allow you to make major purchases at lower interest rates throughout your life.
