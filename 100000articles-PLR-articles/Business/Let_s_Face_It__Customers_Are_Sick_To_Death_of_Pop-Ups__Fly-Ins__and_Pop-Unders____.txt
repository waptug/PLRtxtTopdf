Dear Online Marketer,

Have you ever wished that.....



"Visitors Are Actually Excited To See Your Ads!"

NEW Version 2 Just Released!



Consumers are exposed to hundreds maybe even thousands of commercial messages per day in one form or another -- from the boring, copy-laden radio commercial to the easily skimmed, forgettable newspaper ad, to the billboard on the side of the bus to the logo on the side of the building and finally to those annoying Pop-Ups you see on every other website!

 

Research from the University of Washington conducted in 1999 stats: “The average American is exposed to 500 to 1,000 commercial messages a day . That's anywhere from 182,500 to 365,000 commercial messages that a person will view this year alone.” And that was way back in 1999!!! Imagine what it probably is today! It's no wonder that people have become "Banner Blind" and constantly block or exit from Pop-ups with their itchy trigger finger.

 

Isn't there something else? Something that is less intrusive yet more effective. A type of advertisement that makes my customers WANT to see it, instead of Repelling them from your site?

 

YES! Finally There Is! It's a New Breed of Ads that's not only pleasing to the eye, but also incredibly effective in drawing in your customer's attention, causing them to click, and most importantly getting more of them to reach for their wallets because they're actually interacting with your ads now instead of running from them.
