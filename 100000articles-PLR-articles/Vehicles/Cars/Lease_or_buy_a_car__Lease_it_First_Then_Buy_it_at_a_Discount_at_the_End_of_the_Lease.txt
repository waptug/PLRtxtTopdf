Title: 
Lease or buy a car? Lease it First Then Buy it at a Discount at the End of the Lease

Summary:
Because too many cars are being made today, anyone planning on buying a car should lease it first.

Most carmakers are subsidizing leases, which means that at the end of the lease the car is almost always worth less than its residual value. That’s the time to make an offer for even less than the residual value and maybe save a few thousand dollars.

<b>Car</b>makers are offering <b> car lease payment</b> deals that can’t be beaten. So if your stuck on making <b>lease</b> vs <b>buy</b> decisions about a new <b>car</b>, then here are the tips for buying a new <b>car</b> by leasing is first and <b><I>buying it at a discount</b></I> at the end of the <b>lease</b>. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 

At the end of a <b>lease</b> the company financially backing the <b>lease</b> most likely will sell the <b>car</b> on the open market at a loss because it initially inflated the residual value unrealistically. Why not intervene at that point and buy the <b>car</b> for less than the residual value and put that “loss” into your pocket as money saved?

Because of the oversupply of <b>cars</b> of all kinds, from all manufacturers, it’s likely that rebates and discounts will be offered for several years to come.

<b>Leases are attractive during over production</B>
To overcome this, <b>leases</b> will also reflect these discounts and end up being “subsidized” for a similar period by increasing the residual value of a <b>car, Calculating lease payments</b> using the higher residual value makes the <b>lease</b> price more attractive than a competitor’s offer.  This lowers the monthly <b>lease</b> price.

Until labor contracts for the Big Three: GM, Ford, and Chrysler, can be significantly reduced, they have no choice but to continue subsidizing <b>leases</b> in order to spur sales. This is once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to minimize the cost of a new <b>car</b> by leasing it first, and then buying it at the end of the <b>lease</b>.

<b>New cars will continue being a bargain</b> 
In the past, the auto manufacturers moved <b>cars</b> by subsidizing <b>leases</b>. The monthly <b>lease</b> cost was lowered by increasing the residual value, thereby selling (leasing) more <b>cars</b>.  But the value of the vehicle at the end of the <b>lease</b> was almost always less than the contracted residual and each of the off-<b>lease</b> <b>cars</b> then had to be sold in the wholesale market at a loss of several thousand dollars.

This means that at the end of the <b>lease</b> its used <b>car</b> value may also be less than the market value.  It is unlikely it will ever be more. That is the time to buy the <b>car</b> at a discount from the contracted residual value.

Several of the big backers of <b>lease</b> financing, Chrysler, some New York banks, and others, each lost several hundred million dollars in each of the past several years because they had to sell the off-<b>lease cars</b> on the open market for less than the residual value.

<b>Future trends favor the consumer</b>
The Automotive industry is saddled with excessive employee benefits, i.e. health and welfare and pension obligations for current and retired employees. Worse, there are too many plants worldwide making vehicles. 

If China’s <b>car</b> industry enters the United States in three or four years with the “Cherry” automobile, a talked about vehicle made in China with Chinese wages, the situation will only get worse.

<b>Excessive employee benefit plans for the Big Three</b>
Compounding the problem for some of the manufacturers is that their labor contracts are so juicy that they are better off continuing to give away <b>cars</b> rather than to close a plant continuing to pay benefits to laid off employees. 

This situation will not change for several years until consolidation, plant closings, or bankruptcies have cured the problem. And plant closings will be a last resort. Therefore the glut of new <b>cars</b> will likely continue for a few years and the subsidized <b>lease</b> will continue to be offered.

<b>A true-life example</b>
A business friend of mine had a three-year-old <b>leased</b> <b>car</b> with a contract residual value of $28,000. Looking at the used <b>car</b> lot he found he could buy one just like it for $24,000. He assumed the company that financed the <b>lease</b> would loose at least $2,000 in selling it.  Through the dealer he offered $22,000 to buy the <b>car</b> and his offer was promptly accepted, including 3%, 3 year financing. His dealings, all by phone (no face to face negotiations needed) were with the company financing the <b>lease</b>.

So <b>lease</b> the <b>car</b> of your dreams today if you ultimately want to buy it. Let the companies financing the <b>lease</b> continue to subsidize your monthly <b>lease</b> payment. About three months before the end of the <b>lease</b>, cruise the used <b>car</b> lots and notice what your <b>car</b> is being offered at and then buy the <b>car</b> (no commissions paid to anyone on this transaction) at the end of the <b>lease</b> and keep several thousand dollars in your pocket.
