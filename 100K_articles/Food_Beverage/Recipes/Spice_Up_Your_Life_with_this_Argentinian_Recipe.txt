Article Body:
One of the favourite cooking methods in Argentina is, without a doubt, grilling.  This style of cooking is derived from the original Argentinian Gaucho tradition of cooking fresh meat over a charcoal fire.    

To add flavour and tenderise the meat, Argentines often marinate meats in Chimichurri.  Food without Chimichurri just wouldn't be tolerated in Argentina especially grilled meat to which it adds an amazing flavour.


<b>Argentine Chimichurri</b>

1/3 packet of garlic salt
6 chilli peppers
2 sachets bouquet garni
1 large onion
½ tub of dried peppers
1 pint (500ml) of vinegar
2 pints (1 litre) oil

Boil all the ingredients, excluding oil,  together in the vinegar for five minutes.
Wait until the mixture cools.
When the mixture has cooled, add the oil.
Store in refrigerator.

When you're ready to barbecue or grill, marinade meat in chimichurri overnight.  Barbecue, grill or cook in the oven.  Enjoy!

Many thanks to friends who gave me this recipe whilst we were living in the Falkland Islands.
