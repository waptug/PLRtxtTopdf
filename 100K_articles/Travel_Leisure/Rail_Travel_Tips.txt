You should never leave your luggage on the train or station unguarded. Always keep an eye on your luggage and keep it close to you. If the rail journey is lengthy, you should keep your baggage to the rack securely and put on a small bicycle lock to prevent any possibility of theft or stealing. As far as possible, try to keep your money concealed, don’t flaunt it on the train. 

Do your packing in advance. Ideally you should pack your bags one day before your travel. This would give you ample time to think about all the necessary items you need to carry along. So packing should be done ideally a day before you leave. If you plan to pack your bags at the last moment, you would probably end up missing things.

You should always check that all your bags and attaché are locked. Double check them and place their keys with you. Always have duplicate keys. The duplicate keys are great relief, incase you lose your original keys.
