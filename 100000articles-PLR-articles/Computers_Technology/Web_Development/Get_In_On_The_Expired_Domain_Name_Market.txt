The cat is out of the bag as more and more people are becoming aware of the profit making potential in the expired domain name market. The fact is that there are a lot of viable domain names that have expired and are available to be bought up and claimed as your own.

You may be asking yourself how an active domain that is generating business can be simply abandoned by someone but the fact is that it happens every day for any number of reasons. People change courses in their lives and simply let things go all the time, which can lead to their domain names becoming abandoned.

There are also those people that try to get rich quick who create, promote and discard domains on a regular basis. Due to the fact that many of these domains have been heavily promoted prior to being abandoned, many times they have regular traffic that which can prove lucrative if you were to place a website on that domain, or alternatively the traffic can be redirected to other websites. You may not get rich quick, but you can achieve a steady income. Overtime you could build up an impressive portfolio of domains that provide a very large income.

For affiliate marketers, these expired domain names can be a gold mine for generating traffic to their websites. Affiliate marketing is a great way for someone who has the gift of an entrepreneurial spirit to break into the internet business world. The great thing about affiliate marketing is that you don't have the hassle of filling orders or acquiring inventory. An affiliate marketing website only needs to attracts visitors and then direct them to other websites that are selling the actual product. After a sale is made, the owner of the originating website is paid a percentage of the sale. So you can see how valuable expired domains can be in providing the traffic for affiliate marketers.

It is important to point out that there are many expired domains that were never promoted, and won't receive any visitors. It can be a hard, time consuming challenge to find an expired domain that will provide you with visitors - you need a list of domains, then you need to find out when the domains will expire (or maybe they have expired already), then discover how good the domain may be. To discover how valuable the domain might be to you, you need to discover such things as the topic of the original website on the domain, how many links point at the domain, how search engines rank the domain, etc.

Without this data, it is almost impossible to decide which domains are worth registering. There are several websites that can provide you with the necessary data, and they are well worth a look.

Some corporations have been making money for years by having a large number of domains that direct visitors to their business website. Some of these companies specialize in buying expiring domains which can then result in thousands of visitors each and every day to their websites. If they can do it, why not you?
