After years of paying my cable company crazy rates for service and with them steadily increasing year after year, I decided that it was time for a change.  I started looking into different services that were available.   I spent a lot of money checking into different services but along the way I stumbled upon <a href="http://houroc.ipodpsp.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_top">Satellite TV for PC</a>.  All I have to say it WOW! They offer one of the best packages that I have seen with a great price.  You get over 3000 channels for the one time charge of $49.95.  I was paying close to double that MONTHLY with my cable company.

The PC Satellite TV software is very easy to install and use.  With my DSL connection, I downloaded, installed, and was watching TV in about 15 minutes. It requires no additional equipment or tv cards.  All you have to have is a PC and an internet connection and you will have access to all of the channels PC Satellite TV offers.  I am using Windows Vista and it works perfectly on my computer.  The software includes no ads or spyware. <a href="http://houroc.ipodpsp.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_top">Click Here</a>  

I have been using PC Satellite TV for several months now and I cannot say enough about the picture quality.  I have to be honest, I wasn’t expecting much but I was blown away when I watched my first movie on my computer with this service.

You have access to programming from around the world and you can get sports from many different countries including the United States, Canada, Japan, England, and India. There are also a lot of different categories that you have access to including news, movies, music, weather, children’s programming, and educational. <a href="http://houroc.ipodpsp.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_top">Click Here</a>  

There is no waiting for the cable guy to come, no waiting for the mail, no shipping and handling charges.  There are no recurring fees at all.  Personally for me, that was the best thing about PC Satellite TV.  I was tired of falling behind with my cable bill and dealing with their rate increases.  

This is the perfect software for people who travel a lot.  With one purchase you can install it on multiple computers, including your laptop and as long as you have in internet connection you will still have access to all of your channels no matter where in the world you are. 

If I could rate this service I would definitely give it a 10 out of 10.  Don’t take my word for it.  <a href="http://pc-satellite-tv-review.blogspot.com/" target="_top">Check it out for yourself</a>.  Why keep paying your cable or satellite company?
