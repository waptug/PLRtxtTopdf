Potential clients are much interested in your articles, it is imperative that you must concentrate on improving your articles into “hypnotizing agents”. Below are some facts that you can take into consideration in writing your articles:

•	If you want your article to be read, be sure that it is interesting. If you have a dull topic then its content will also be dull, no one will ever dare to read it. Also, remember that all your readers are bearing questions in their minds about the stuffs that you are offering. Answer these possible questions through your articles.

•	Most people read your articles for information, not for some sort of brief description of your products and its retail price. If these readers found out that your article is more of promotion rather than giving information, they will get turned off and will never hesitate to hit that “Back” button right away. Make articles that serves their interests rather than your own.

•	Always have good selection of English grammar and spelling. This may sound basic for you, but it is a must in article writing. You do not have to use beautiful words; just make it simple but easy to understand. When dealing with technical topics, make sure that it can be understood by everybody. Remember that you have a general audience.

•	Be specific of the tips that you want to include in your articles. Most readers are much interested on the tips that individual articles are providing. Have it enumerated or bulleted for easy reading.

•	Say what you want to say straight and clear. Avoid lengthy paragraphs or it may confuse your readers on things that you want to say. Your article should not make the reader ask “What is this guy trying to tell me?”

•	Provide attention-grabbing statements in the resource box. It can be usually found at the bottom where you can tell anything about you and advertise your site as well. Do not ever attempt to sell in this resource box—your sites will provide such after your reader have clicked that link.

•	Lastly, have your article maximum publicity. Submit it to different article directories. But before you submit such articles, make sure that you have checked the contents.

After you have submitted your articles in these directories, you will notice after a few weeks that there are many sites that will link back to your website.

It makes your site increase its ranking on different search engines as well.
