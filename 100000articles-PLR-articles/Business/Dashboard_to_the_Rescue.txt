In essence, the dashboard of a car serves as the control center.  Via the dashboard you can change the radio, turn up the volume, defrost the windows, heat up the car, cool down the car, or even insert a CD to listen to.  More advanced and luxurious cars have dashboards that give the driver a glimpse of the conditions in and around the car – such as the temperature outside, the speed of the car, the time, and the song currently playing on the stereo system etc.  Simply put, dashboards are great at offering a quick glance into ones current condition, providing a simple yet powerful visual representation of information.
