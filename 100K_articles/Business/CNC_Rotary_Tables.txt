Article Body:
A CNC Rotary table is a piece of CNC milling equipment used for precision metalworking. It is similar than a dividing head or indexing head except that it is fixed to be used in only two planes, the horizontal plane and the vertical plane. A CNC Rotary table is used for CNC milling and is made up of a solid base that has proper provisions for clamping metal material on tables and other kinds of equipment. The table of this CNC milling equipment is a precision machined disc that also has provision to clamp materials in it, that is aided with a T slot. This CNC milling equipment can rotate by itself or be controlled by a worm or a handheld operational control. 

1. Extreme Accuracy

A graduated dial and a vernier scale allow this rotary table to be positioned to a high degree of accuracy. The center of CNC milling equipment has hole that allows a morse taper center or fixture to be inserted. A tailstock is usually provided if the rotary table can be mounted from its end, so that the axis will be horizontal. The most common use of this CNC milling equipment is on it vertical axis that in this mode is on the same plane as the cutter when it is used on a milling machine.

2. Coaxial Design

If the CNC rotary table is mounted on a secondary table the work piece is adjusted in the center around the rotary tables axis, in this position the work piece is centered around the cutting tools axis; this make all three axis coaxial. Making a way for the secondary table to be offset in either the x or y plane so that the cutter is pitched at a distance from the work piece’s center allowing a simultaneous operations on the work piece. 

3. Specialized Or General?

There are literally hundreds of CNC milling equipments available on the market today with different specifications and different additional features. They come in all types of shapes and sizes. Some are designed for specific applications, while others are more of general purposes in nature. When looking for the right CNC rotary tables, try to talk to people who already using this kind of equipments from them you can learn how this things work. The good thing about talking to this people is that you will gain information not based on industrial propagandas but on experience and uses of there CNC milling equipments. You can also visit a shop in your area so that you will ly see on how CNC rotary tables work. You can eve try to use one CNC milling equipment to know how it feels. You can also attend CNC seminars to be able to gain professional views about his matters and also do not forget to check online information sites. 

4. Setting Up Shop

When setting up your CNC rotary tables make sure that the platform is stable and your CNC milling machine secure. Setting up your CNC milling machines is a critical issue to early success, the less movement that occur the better. The right material to be used should also be thought about when using this kind of CNC milling machines. Determine the right thickness and sizes of your materials. Also look for proper fixtures for your CNC milling machines, for this will save time, money and frustration when using your CNC rotary tables.

Before going into production, make a plan to test the different variables you need to work with for a period of time. Getting familiar with your machine is also a critical issue for success. Try to make familiar with the different types of cut, type of materials to be cut, the table type, the depths of cut, the feed rates and the type and sizes of bits that you will be utilizing. Feel around the machine but not literally though for it may I injure you.

5. Satefy

Make sure to read your manuals and have a thorough understanding about the safety measures and the different features of your CNC milling machines. Have a good idea on how this things works. On what it can do to make your business prosper and also on how it can harm your employees.
