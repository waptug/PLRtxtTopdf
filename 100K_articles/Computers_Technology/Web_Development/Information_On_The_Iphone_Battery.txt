Common Questions and Answers

One of the most commonly asked questions about the iPhone battery is whether it is covered by a warranty and the answer is yes, it is, and not only that but you can also extend the warranty if you want to two years with AppleCare Protection Plan for iPhone. 

The iPhone battery is not disposable and is designed to last for a very long time, years in fact as long as it is properly taken care of in the meantime. In fact, Apple is consistently ranked number one in terms of product quality and support by various leading consumer groups around the world. 

Over time however, as with almost any other related device, the iPhone battery will begin to progressively degrade, as over time the battery will simply not be able to hold the same amount of charge as it did when it was new. This is true of all lithium ion batteries, and there is a very easy solution to this problem – buy a new battery. 

This is not a huge deal, because you will only have to buy a battery once you notice a serious decrease in efficiency of the iPhone battery, which will typically be around a year or so of average use of the device.

Not only that, but the batteries are usually very affordable so it is definitely not a purchase that you are going to have to dread or worry about shelling out a lot of money for.

If you are really concerned about getting the best out of your iPhone battery, then you should know that there are a few different things you can do here. One is to keep a regular and proper charging pattern, and it is also generally recommended that you store lithium ion batteries at about 40% charge. If you know that you will be storing your iPhone for an extended period of time somewhere, then the best idea here is to store it in a cool place. 

As long as you take proper care of your iPhone battery and other iPhone parts, it will last you a really long time and work effectively and efficiently. http://www.the-iphone.biz/
