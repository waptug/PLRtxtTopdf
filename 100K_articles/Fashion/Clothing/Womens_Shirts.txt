Women's tops are offered by most clothing retailers.  One of the most popular types of women's tops that are offered by vendors are t-shirts.  When you are shopping for t-shirts it is important to look for the size, color, design, and style that is right for the woman that you are shopping for.

The first thing that you will want to look for in a women's t-shirt is that it is the right style.  There are many different styles to choose from including: long tees, short sleeve tees, baby doll tees, vintage tees, and puff sleeve t-shirts.  In addition to the style of the t-shirt you may also want to look for designer tees.

The second thing that you will want to look for when shopping for a t-shirt is that it offers a color palette and design that will fit into your wardrobe and that also is appealing to you.  If you will be using the t-shirt as a layering piece then you may want to buy several t-shirts in a variety of colors that compliment the other existing pieces in your wardrobe. If the t-shirt will be worn to work then you will need to make sure that its color and design are appropriate for a work environment.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a fun casual t-shirt then you may want to look for one that offers a funky color and design.

The final thing that you will want to look for when shopping for women's tops of any kind is that they are the right size.  Sizes seem to vary from designer to designer so if you are not familiar with the designer of the t-shirt that you are interested in it will be important for you to try on that shirt to make sure that it fits properly.  If you are shopping online you will need to use the site's sizing chart to find the proper size for you.
