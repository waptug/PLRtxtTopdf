Webkinz Cheat Codes:  Do They Exist?

Are you an internet user who loves buying Webkins plus toys just to get the secret codes that let you adopt online virtual pets?  If you are, you may be looking for easy ways to get extra KinzCash and other extras for your virtual pets.  Although it is relatively easy to earn these items legitimately online, many internet users instead look for secret cheat codes.  If you are interested in doing so, you may be curious to whether or not there is really such a thing as Webkinz cheat codes.

So is there is such a thing?  In all honesty, the answer is both yes and no.  While this may not be the answer that you were hoping for, it is the truth.  Why?  Because Webkinz cheat codes are a little bit tricky.

For starters, there are a number of online websites that claim to list secret cheat codes for the virtual world.  However, when you closely look at many of the websites, you see anything but secret cheat codes.  Instead, you often find a website filled with advertisements on it.  These types of websites are often just a ploy to make money from online advertisements.  

As previously stated, not all of the websites that claim to list Webkinz cheat codes actually do, but there are real websites out there.  Unfortunately, they can sometimes be difficult to find.  As for how you can find these websites, you may want to start with a standard internet search.  This will likely produce the above mentioned websites that only “claim,” to list secret cheat codes for Webkinz pets.  With that said, no harm can come from examining these websites.  Somewhere in your search, you will likely find a site that is filled with the information you want.

Webkinz cheat codes can also be found by visiting other websites, like online message boards or Yahoo! Answers.  Many times, internet users will post the cheat codes that they find online themselves or they may point you in the direction of websites that do list them.  Since Webkinz cheat codes are in high demand and since many internet users are curious about them, they are likely already discussed online, but you can still ask your own questions.  This approach allows you to save time, as you don’t have to do your own research.

As for what type of Webkinz cheat codes you will find online, you will find a variance.  Popular cheat codes allow you to get more KinzCash, which is the virtual cash that allows you to buy items for your virtual pets, including food and medicine. There are also cheat codes that give you an extra pet or unlimited furniture.  What you need to remember though is that Webkinz cheat codes and their ability to work changes often.

One of the reasons why Webkins cheat code change often and may not work by the time you try them, is because Ganz, the company that owns the Webkinz brand, is starting to catch on.  They know that these cheat codes are being used to deceive their system setup.  In fact, they actually have a warning message posted on their website stating that using the cheat codes violates their rules.  Of course, you can try these cheat codes, but please know that you may suffer consequences if you are caught.  The message on the Webkinz website claims that you can and will be banned.  This not only means that you will lose your right to use the site, but you will also likely lose your adoption codes and all of your virtual cash, even if they have yet to technically expire.

Now that you know that Webkins cheat codes do exists, as well as how you can go about finding them, you have an important decision to make.  That decision involves whether or not you should actually use them.  As a reminder, Ganz, the company behind the brand, does not encourage the use of these cheat codes and you may find yourself banned from the website.
