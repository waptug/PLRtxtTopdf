Myspace page is a very important site on the Internet that will be frequented by a number of visitors including friends, relatives and colleagues. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the Myspace member to ensure that the page is attractive and all the features that will help register the maximum hits. The more the number of features, the greater is the visibility of the myspace page. It can be decked up with a number of add on features like colors, artificial flowers and designs, themes and backgrounds that will add aesthetics to the Myspace page of the member. The onus of developing the Myspace page depends on the attitude of the user. If the user wants to remain low profile, the Myspace page could be basic and normal without any additional features on them. If you do not want any visitors, then provide a filter to the page to screen the visitors. If you do not want the myspace page to be in the public domain, it can be achieved by restricting access to the site. All these features are embedded in the background by the user. The site can also have images of the member, the favorite habits, hobbies and networking issues.

If you want the Myspace page to be full of images, then select a dull colored background for the site. The dull color is necessary to ensure that the images have adequate visibility. In a dull colored background the visibility of the images will be enhanced. If the background of the Myspace page is dark such as red, blue or orange, the images might not receive the attention due to them. Besides, they do not augur well with the image flow. Besides, if the image album is black and white, the color combination could be a total contrast. The resultant page might appear awkward to not only the user, but also the visitor. Therefore, as much as possible, keep the page evergreen by ensuring the right color and combination. Choose a dull color like navy blue or amber or lavender. This will not only enhance the beauty of the images, but add greatly to the aesthetic value of the site. However, make sure that the color splash does not mask the images in the process.

A number of designs are also available for the use of the member. They can be of any shapes or sizes. It can be the designs such as nature or landscape or those that are futuristic. If the designs are futuristic, it could reflect the attitude of the of the Myspace user. However, if you do not want to look futuristic, stick to the traditional design. The futuristic design might not be appealing to all of the visitors.

The futuristic designs come in all kinds of visualizations. For instance, it could be the image of deep space or graffiti. The futuristic designs also sport a trendy look and gives the feel of a young to the account holder. If you do not like the background, it can always be replaced with another background of your choice.
