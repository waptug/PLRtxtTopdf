UK witnessed, London Land Scams, Kent Land Scams and Sussex Land Scams, and since then Land for sale in the UK are proving a popular investment opportunity due to the scarcity of land, as the demand for property in the United Kingdom continues to rise, more and more investors are turning to land investment as an excellent long-term growth source. The land banking companies allows private individual investors to capitalize on this growing market, generating substantial returns with minimal risk exposure.

An investor has a whole bouquet of investment opportunities. Right from equity to real estate and from parking his money in Banks to gambling. But none of these gives guaranteed return. All the opportunities are subject to many risks such as exchange rate risk, currency risk, market risk etc. So a prudent investor searches for an investment opportunity which gives maximum returns with minimum risk. 

Land investment is one such opportunity. Though this also does not guarantee definite returns but the risks involved are less. Moreover land prices never depreciate. Land is tangible which can be used for self if the returns do not appear lucrative enough. Hence it can be safely said that for a speculative investor investing in land would be the safest and most rewarding option. 

But the initial investment for land in other parts of the world apart from UK is too high. So UK is one nation which provides ample opportunities for the investor to rake in profits, though the time frame is a bit on the higher side, from 3 to 5 years. But then long term investment demands time.
