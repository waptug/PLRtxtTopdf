Article Body:
Investing in foreign currencies is a relatively new avenue of investing.  There are considerably fewer people are aware of this market than there are people aware of several other avenues of investing.  Trading foreign currency, also known as forex, is the most lucrative investment market that exists.  There are several factors that make this true among which, successful forex traders earn realistic profits of one hundred plus percent each month.  Compared to some of the better known investment markets such as corporate stocks, this is an unheard of return on investment.  It's very necessary to mention here that a person who invests in forex must, without exception, make it a point to learn the detailed, but simple strategies and information surrounding the market.  This very fact is what makes the difference between successful forex traders and other traders. 

	 A few additional points, which create such powerful leverage for investors within the forex market are: The amount of capital required to begin investing in the market is only three hundred dollars.  For the most part, any other investment market is going to demand thousands of dollars of the investor in the beginning.  Also, the market offers opportunities to profit regardless what the direction of the market may be; In most commonly known markets investors sit and wait for the market to begin an up trend before entering a trade.  Even then, investors, as a rule must sit and wait some more to be able to exit the trade with a nice profit. 

 Given that the forex market produces several up, down, and sideways trends in a single day, it can easily be seen that forex stands head and shoulders above other markets.  Additionally there are trading strategies, which are taught that provide for compounded profits; these are profits on top of profits.  In addition, free demo accounts are available within the industry of forex trading, which facilitate the sharpening of skills without the risk losing any capital.  And the advantage regarding the time factor in trading foreign currency is a very attractive point for any investor.  Compared to one of the most sought after avenues of investing, which often requires forty or more hours each week, namely in the real-estate market, the forex market requires a much smaller demand on the investor's time.  Forex trading requires approximately ten to fifteen hours each week to earn a full time income.  It's easy to see that the advantages and great leverage that exist in the forex market, make it among the most lucrative, time liberating, and easy to enter by far.
