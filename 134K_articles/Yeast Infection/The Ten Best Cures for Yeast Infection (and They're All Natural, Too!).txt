The Ten Best Cures for Yeast Infection

(and They’re All Natural, Too!)

If you are suffering from yeast infection, chances are your doctor would prescribe topical ointments or ingestible tablets from your local drugstore. But these prescription drugs only aggravate this disease by helping spread the yeast-like fungi Candida albicans. Listed below are the ten best cures for yeast infection in the holistic style.

The first cure is prevention via proper hygiene. Yeast infection spreads primarily through carelessness, whether by exposure to a sufferer, to Candida albicans, or to chemicals which trigger yeast infection. Hence, no lending of personal belongings, and dispose expired products properly. 

The second cure is living a healthy lifestyle. Minimize drinking alcoholic beverages and tap water. Because stress is a trigger, set aside time for relaxation and sleep. 

But what if you did not know these preventive measures? The next cure, then, is to avoid ingesting drugs of any kind. Antibiotics kill the bacteria that monitor the growth of Candida albicans. Other medicines to avoid include birth control medication, immuno-suppressants and steroids.

One effective cure is a strictly regimented diet as determined by your doctor. The standard Candida diet forbids affected individuals from eating the following:

* Sugars, to the point that even fruit may not be allowed;

* Food with high yeast and mold content, like cheeses, dried fruit, melons and peanuts;

* Milk, dairy products, and food with high lactose content (this means that you cannot eat yoghurt, but you can use it to alleviate the effects of yeast infection in other ways).


This diet allows only the following:

* Water;

* Herbal teas;

* All vegetables;

* Sources of protein (meat is allowed, as are fish, poultry and legumes, although soy and soy products are known to have side effects);

* Whole grains like millet, brown rice, and oatmeal without sugar;

* Probiotic supplements; 

* If possible, apples, blueberries, cherries, other berries, and pears.

Reading food labels is an absolute must for the cure to take effect. Sticking to this diet even after the symptoms disappear not only boosts immunity, but also curbs the Candida albicans population boom by reintroducing friendly bacteria.

One way to relieve yeast infection is to apply natural antifungal agents like garlic paste, extra-virgin coconut oil and diluted tea tree oil directly on the skin. Grapeseed extract and tannins from tea and condiments fight chronic infections excellently.

Women with vaginal yeast infection may find relief in a few drops of diluted tea tree oil or a dollop of yoghurt. Application should be done at least twice a day through inserting a tampon with either oil or yoghurt into the vagina. This remedy must be continued one day after the symptoms disappear.

Ingesting licorice helps sufferers of endocrine yeast infection by stimulating hormones without causing side effects. This sweet also can counteract the estrogen loss endured by women with vaginal yeast infection through the release of estrogen-like friendly steroids.

Another great cure is taking in electrolyte-heavy drinks. To make your own, squeeze in half a lemon (full of essential minerals) in a glass of filtered water, then add 1/4 teaspoon of Celtic sea salt (with 84 minerals). Drink it six times during the day, with three of those six times during meals. 

Cleansing your colon naturally washes out the toxins made by Candida albicans and also makes the digestive system receptive to friendly bacteria. Recipes may vary, but they usually involve a mixture of garlic or garlic extract, cayenne peppers, apple cider or apple cider vinegar, and the spicy oregano oil.

So there you have the ten best cures for yeast infection. Take note that these are not the only cures available, but these are the ones which have been proven to work time and again. Do your research, and you may find one which works best for you. Good luck!
