Portable game stations are the hot new craze among the teen and early adult crowd. A surprisingly large percentage of this population is female now that the gaming industry has become wise and started to cater to this large and valuable segment of the gaming market. Anyway these little machines are really quite amazing, using blazing speed and remarkable graphics for the size screen they bear to give the user a believable gaming experience wherever they go. The battery life is and always has been a limiting factor but is constantly getting better and users now enjoy 4-6 hrs of gaming before a recharge is necessary. They also have the capacity to support all of the psp download applications that are available.

Perhaps the neatest thing about these new portable devices (computers really), is the compatible platform with most digital types of media and the large capacity of memory to store it. This really is a trend that encompasses all of the new digital media players including the ipods, pdas, etc. Not only is the psp a portable gaming device that can store thousands of games (which are gotten on any number of the several psp download sites), but it can function as a portable movie player as well as a portable music player (or other audio such as books, lectures, etc.).

So if you have been thinking about getting one or all of these things for your child (or yourself for that matter), than consider the sony psp for the sheer power of its processor and the multiple uses that it can provide. If you don’t believe me about the other types of media than you should go check out one of the psp download web sites. All you do is google for “psp download” and you will find that there are several such sites and that they not only offer the games like you would expect, but they also offer music, music videos, and full length movies too.

Just think if your family likes to travel and would prefer to drive to save money on travel and have freedom once you get to your destination but are leery of putting your kids through torture, this may be your answer. Your kids will love the psp and all of the things that can be done with it via the psp download capability.
