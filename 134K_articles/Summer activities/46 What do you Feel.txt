What do you Feel?

With this activity, your children are going to be using their sense of feel to figure out 
what different objects are when they are blindfolded.  You can create different themes to 
play this game (items from nature or the kitchen) or mix things up for a game that is a bit 
harder.

All you need for this activity is a blindfold and many different objects that are different 
shapes, sizes and textures.  The children have to wear the blindfold and try and guess 
what they are holding by touch alone.

Examples of items to use from nature:
 
*	Pinecones 
*	Moss
*	Flower (all different kinds)
*	Blades of grass
*	Leaf
*	Stones
*	Dandelion seeds

Examples of items to use from the kitchen:

*	Sponges or washcloths
*	Potato or other textured vegetable
*	Pineapple or other piece of fruit that won’t be damaged easily
*	Soap in a container, have a cloth handy to wipe their hands with afterwards
*	Measuring spoons

You can set-up different stations for the children to go to or having everything laid out on 
one table.  A variation on this activity is to use the sense of smell instead of touch.  Still 
use the blind fold but use items that have a distinct odor to see if the children can guess 
what the item is.  Spices such as cinnamon and pepper are easy to identify.

You can set up different tables where different senses have to be used at each table.  A 
touching table, a smelling table, and a tasting table.  The tasting table can be fun, but if 
you are playing with children that are not your own make sure you are aware of any 
allergies that they may have.  Also, don’t put anything out that a child strongly dislikes it 
will prevent them from wanting to play the game again.
