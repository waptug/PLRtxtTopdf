Bar codes are made through various combinations of spaces and bars to create an encoded character message. Both the differences in the ink level and the spacing between the bars can be encoded variables. The bar code reader measures the light that comes back from the symbols, and comparing that to a computer database, offers what the symbol means to a computerized inventory program. The type of bar code you and your small business decide to use depends entirely on how much information you need the bar code to store. You can encrypt anywhere from fourteen digits to thousands of characters.

Once you have decided to make use of bar code technology in your small business, you have to decide what type of bar code printer you need. To print any type of bar code, you will need software that supports bar coding. Once you've gotten that far, you will also need a printer that can handle printing bar codes. Because accuracy is essential in the business of bar coding, a good printer is essential. While some common laser printers and desk printers can handle bar code technology, they have to be configured to your software. Buying a dedicated bar code printer is a good idea, in any case.

Bar code printers can work well with many different computer interfaces, and can be hooked up in a number of different ways including ethernet cables, USB cables, parallel cables, serial cables, twinax cables, and coax cables. More recently, it is possible to use a bar code printer with wireless technology like Bluetooth or 802.11b. Most companies who sell bar code printers also offer technical support like remote monitoring and trouble shooting.

You can decide on the right bar code printer to meet your needs by first thinking about size. The size of your bar code labels is very important to figuring out which printer you need. You should consider the kinds of environments the label will be expected to perform in http://www.exeterdaily.com/category/technology-online. This can help you decide upon the print method. There are two types of print methods: direct thermal and thermal transfer. Direct thermal creates an image on the material that is to be labeled. Thermal transfer uses a heated ribbon to create the image of your bar code on a wide selection of materials.

I am quite happy with my new bar coding system. Finding a bar code printer that fits your needs can make all the difference in your business.
