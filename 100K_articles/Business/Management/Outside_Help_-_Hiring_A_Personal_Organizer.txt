Some people who are too busy with work may sometimes be absent minded about certain things and tend to forget doing some of their important chores. If this happens more frequently, it is best to get a handyman of some sort to help out rather than making one's performance suffer. A personal organizer can be hired to do just about anything, whether it is something that has to do with work in the office or activities that need to be done at home with the family. 

Hiring a personal organizer is like hiring an applicant for any other job. One should prepare a list of questions that the person must be able to answer and if the individual answers well, then the job can be offered. Here are some questions that one can ask a potential personal organizer:

1. How long has the person been doing this line of work?

2. What kind of work does the individual specialize in?

3. There are many other jobs that one can do. Before the person did this, what are the previous jobs, if any, that the individual did before?

4. What is the educational background of the person?

5. If the person has done this before, who are the previous clients that worked with the individual before that can be contacted as references.

6. How much will the person expect if accepted for the job? Will it be by hour or per day?

7. Will the person charge if there will be a trial working session set up to see if there will be any problems working with that individual?

8. What are the suggestions that the person can give regarding the first impression that the individual sees as wrong or unfit in the present working environment?

9. What assurance is there that the advice given will work for the one who hired the personal organizer? Will there be a follow-up session to assess the progress if it works or not? Will there be semi-annual or quarterly check-ups offered to monitor ones progress? 
 
10. Does the personal organizer know anyone that can be contacted if there is a need to establish organizational systems?

Once the person is able to find the right personal organizer to be around with, the individual will not have to worry about things that were overlooked since there is someone nearby making sure that everything will be alright.
