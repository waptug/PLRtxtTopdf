}Benefits of CAMTS Certification for Air Ambulance Services\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 As you shop
 around for an air ambulance service, you may be confused about all the details.  
How do you know which air ambulance service is best?  If you are looking for air
 ambulance transportation that is high-quality and lives up to standards, then look
 for a service that is CAMTS certified.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 What does
 CAMTS mean?  The initials CAMTS stand for Commission on Accreditation of Medical
 Transport Services.  Companies who are accredited by CAMTS receive several benefits
.  Although the company must incur some cost and time commitment for the certification
, the company who receives such an honor will appreciate the time and money invested
.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The air ambulance
 service that is certified by CAMTS may have lowered insurance premiums due to the
 quality commitment and high safety standards.  Local, state, and federal government
 may recognize the CAMTS certified air ambulance company.  Such certified air ambulance
 services may be granted contracts only available to certified companies.  The credibility
 attained by CAMTS certification is prestigious among other medical transport companies
 and the public.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Customers
 will note the CAMTS certification and know that they are securing a flight with
 a dependable air ambulance service.  The commitment to excellence seen only by 
CAMTS certified companies will provide confidence to the customer.  During stressful
 times, it can be hard to know that you are making the right decision about medical
 issues, but choosing a CAMTS certified air ambulance will make the decision easier
.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Because no
 federal or state regulations exist to standardize many of the practices associated
 with air ambulance transport, it is difficult to determine which companies are 
best and which companies simply will do the job.  CAMTS certified companies are 
required to meet minimum standards that indicate the company is providing excellent
 service that focuses on patient comfort and safety.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The company
 interested in certification begins by critically assessing their own organization
.  This helps the air ambulance service note their strengths and weaknesses.  In
 time, inspectors come to the site of the service to assess the company and their
 practices.  With this amount of scrutiny, it is no doubt that the company has the
 opportunity to perfect any problems.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Measurements
 are taken in regards to communication, administration, education, and maintenance
.  If the air ambulance company fails to meet the minimum requirements, they will
 not receive the CAMTS certification.  While companies who do not have the certification
 may, in fact, meet the standards, there is no way to judge this fact.  Customers
 selecting only CAMTS certified air ambulance services can be certain that such 
minimum standards are met.  Periodically, certified companies are re-evaluated to
 ensure quality.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Certification
 from the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Services offers several
 benefits for the air ambulance service.  Among prestige and lower insurance premiums
, the company will get more business.  Customers in search of a high-quality air
 ambulance service will be able to easily separate the CAMTS certified companies
 from the rest of the pack.  CAMTS certification is a win-win situation for both
 air ambulance companies and potential customers of the service.     }}
