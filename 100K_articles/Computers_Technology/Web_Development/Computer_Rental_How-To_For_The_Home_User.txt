Perhaps you've already heard all about how businesses can benefit from computer rentals. What you may not know is that you, as a home user, can reap the same or similar benefits from at-home computer rentals.

First of all, we all know that computers are forever changing. If you were to spend thousands of dollars on buying a brand-new, state-of-the-art computer, it'd be out-of-date within months. Then you'd be the not-so-proud owner of a "dinosaur" computer. But if you were to go with a computer rental, you wouldn't be in that dilemma.

Computer rentals often include upgrades at no extra cost to you. Or if the computer rental you've selected becomes obsolete, most computer rental companies will replace the rental with a new computer rental. And you'll only pay a nominal fee, or none at all for this service.

Plus if you decide to go the computer rental route for your personal use, you'll have the same flexible payment options that a business computer rental user gets. A lot of computer rental companies will let you take your computer rental home after only one month deposit! Of course, you have to sign an agreement promising to pay the remainder of the costs over a period of time.

Computer rental payments are typically interest-free. You sign your computer rental agreement for a specified time and simply pay one, never-changing monthly payment for the time of the agreement.

Payments on a computer rental are immediately tax-deductible, even if you use your computer rental at home. If you were to buy your computer brand-new, you'd only be able to claim a portion of the cost on your tax return.

Choosing to go the computer rental route can save you money in other ways. For example, if you need other computer accessories (like scanners or digital cameras), you can also get those from the computer rental company. Often if you already have a computer rental, you can rent these accessories for a discount, or perhaps for a short-term contract.

When you get a computer rental, in most cases you'll also get professional installation and training from a computer rental representative who knows what they're doing. If you were to buy a computer, you'd need to pay extra to have someone install it. You'd have to hire a separate technician to help you learn the ins and outs. Or you'd need to muddle through figuring it out all on your own.

If you have your heart set on owning your own computer, computer rental can help you with that too! Computer rental allows you to try out a computer for a contracted time. If you find out you really like that type of computer, most computer rental companies will give you the option to buy the equipment at fair market value.

Computer rental for home-users, like business-users, can be a wonderful money- and time-saving experience. Those considering computer rental for their homes should be sure to do background research on all computer rental companies before selecting one to work with.
