Canoe Bay

Rice Lake, Wisconsin is home to the beautiful Canoe Bay.  This secluded 280-acre wilderness spot may seem an unlikely place for luxury at its finest, but this resort delivers
just that.

Guests can choose between one of the five rooms within the main building, a four-room lodge or one of the several cabins available.  All exhibit either Adirondack or Frank Lloyd Wright inspired décor.  Each is also located in either a completely wooded or lake view area.  The exceptional restaurant provides breakfast in bed, gourmet lunch baskets and a daily changing four-course dinner menu.

All rooms come complete with TV, cable and VCR and some include a refrigerator and microwave.  Coffee is provided in all rooms.  Activities include picnic tables along the lake, cross country skiing, golf, ice-skating, exercise equipment and a spa. Equipment is provided for kayaking, canoeing and row boating.  Enjoy a day fishing for bass or just relaxing on the water.  For those wishing an indoor activity or on days when weather may prohibit being outdoors, an extensive library of hardcover books and magazines allows guests to catch up on their reading.

The Inn is the go-to spot in the evening, where you'll find the best food in the region served in their lakeside Dining Room. Sneak a peek, too, at their extensive red wine collection on display in the gorgeous Wine Cellar Room.

Cottages offer extreme privacy; choose stand-alone or duplex-style. All accommodations are fully outfitted with fireplace, private deck, King bed, whirlpool-for-two, audio/video system, and mini-fridge. And direct lake views are the rule!

No children are allowed at this facility, so it is a perfect adult getaway for couples that need some time alone together.  Romance is never more alive than in the private surroundings of this wooded wonderland. And you thought Wisconsin only had cheese.
