Summary:
Can prospects sense when you're assuming too much?

Article Body:
<p>We could say that Unlock The Game™ actually takes the "middle ground" between passive and aggressive by being authentically unassuming, yet effective - and that this is the most stress-free and effective way to sell.</p>

<p>What do I mean?</p>

<p>I mean that you have to shift away from assuming that every prospect is a fit for your solution.</p>

<p>It's sort of like the legal concept of "being innocent until proven guilty."</p>

<p>We can't afford to make any assumptions about "fit" until our conversation with the prospect indicates that we've mutually arrived at that conclusion.</p>

<p>The aggressiveness that turns off prospects sets in when you assume, every time you pick up the phone, that you have a solution for them.</p>

<p>Your tone of voice and language gives them that message long before they've even had a chance to agree that they have a problem you might be able to help them solve.</p>

<p>But if you can manage to find that middle ground of not assuming anything while also communicating in a low-key, unassuming manner, you'll discover a whole new effectiveness you could never have imagined.</p>

<p>Can prospects sense when you're assuming too much?</p>

<p>Sure they can -- because most of us have been conditioned to present or talk about our solution as a way to engage prospects so they'll reveal their problems to us.</p>

<p>But that logic is completely flawed, because when you launch into your solution to someone who doesn't trust you yet, all you do is allow them to pigeonhole you as a stereotyped "salesperson."</p>

<p>So how do you make this concept of being unassuming but effective a reality?</p>

<p>First, learn to start conversations by focusing 100 percent on generating discussions around prospects' problems, rather than pitching your solution the second you hear an opening.</p>

<p>Second, learn to begin those conversations by converting the benefits of your solution into problems that your solution can solve.</p>

<p>Third, after you and your prospects have identified a problem or problems, you can then engage in a discussion about whether fixing those problems is a priority.</p>

<p>It's only at that point that prospects have finally given you implicit permission to share your solution with them.</p>

<p>Jumping in with solutions prematurely will only land you back in the trap of being perceived as "aggressive."</p>
