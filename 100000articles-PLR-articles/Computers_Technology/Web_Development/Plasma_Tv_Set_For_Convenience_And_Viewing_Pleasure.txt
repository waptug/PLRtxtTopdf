Do you ever wonder about all the technologies out there used in the TVs you we watch every day?? Plasma, LCD, DLP TVs and sets are flooding the market and satisfy our viewing pleasures, but how can we find order? Which one should we pick? Here comes some help to firmly understand television sets better.

Shopping around for televisions set recently, chances are that you’ve been astounded by the wide variety of TV sets available. I’m not referring to the number of manufacturers. Apart from the brand names, most of us have grown up with; most state of the art television sets today come from the Asian region, from companies in China, Korea. What I am referring to however, is the new technologies that are available. Even though there are still cathode ray tube conventional televisions, on the other hand, there are innovative display systems like liquid crystal display televisions and even what is known as plasma televisions.

In the tried and tested regular televisions that most of us have grown up with, the technology applied is known as the cathode ray tube technology. A cathode gun fires electrons, which, when charged and excited, tend to form an image on a glass screen. These images form as pixels in the three basic colors, which when combined can produce millions of colors. While the technology itself has been improved and developed through the periods to give us great television monitors, there are certain limitations to what the conventional cathode ray tube television can do.

For one thing, being built of glass, the display of the cathode ray tube or conventional television has a size limitation. Most standard televisions which use the cathode ray tube technology are less than 42 inches in size. This size is not the height or width of the television, but the diagonal distance between one end and the other. So, the biggest conventional television you can have is around 42 inches. Small for our viewing pleasure, but trust me, more than heavy enough when carrying it around. So, conventional televisions are massive, restricted in image size and confined to the limitations of the case they are built in. This makes them big, and in some cases impossible to fit into your living room, and I’m not even talking about putting it in your car seat, when moving.

Plasma TV sets sure make our lives easier. Convenient sizes, better view, more colors, less space are only some of the benefits.

This is where newer display technologies have resulted in better, modern televisions like the plasma television. In a plasma television, the older cathode ray tube technology is left behind in favor of an atomic technology. Our ability to manipulate and control the operation of atomic particles has also enables us to improve our viewing experience. This is the science that a plasma television uses. Plasma is a gas that holds freely flowing ions and electrons. When an electric charge is passed through this plasma, photons are released, which then provide illumination. The rest of the technology in plasma televisions is concentrated on using this illumination to create the three primary colors and to display them as images. Just as the cathode ray tube televisions use different intensities of particles to produce differing colors, the plasma television also varies the strength of the illumination to produce color changes. This is why, while watching a plasma television, more numbers of colors can be seen.

The plasma television removes or negates most of the drawbacks of the conventional television. For one thing, size is no longer a restriction. For another, bulky boxes are not required and the plasma television can be as thin as you could have imagined it. Most plasma televisions nowadays appear more or less like works of art hanging in your living room. 

Do you want to try a plasma TV before buying? No problem. You can easily find plasma rental all over. Borrow one for a while; mount it to your wall, or install it on the right furniture, and see, if it rocks your world. And if you are satisfied, do not hesitate, run to a plasma warehouse and buy any one of the quality plasma TVs you can find. 

Adopt the plasma television today and see how innovations in display have enhanced the quality of our entertainment!
