Class parties

      If you volunteered to be a room mother for your child, you will probably be a part of planning parties.  Classroom parties might be different at different schools and probably applies mostly to elementary age classes.  This can be a lot of fun and helps you get to know the other kids in your child’s class.
      Our school has two classroom parties a year.  The first one is Halloween, and then Valentine’s Day.  As part of these parties, you will have specific things that need to be done.
      You can collect donations in the form of money or candy for the kids in the class.  Send home a note with the kids asking for a few dollars or a bag of candy.  Or if you are trying to reduce the sugar intake, collect small toys that can be given out in place of candy, such as pencils, erasers, and other small items.  
      Plan activities and games to do during the party.  Find out what your time frame is for the party and make sure you have enough for the kids to do during that time.  Ideas for the Halloween party include having a Halloween costume contest, making craft items, bob for apples, make popcorn hands (use clear gloves, add candy corn in each finger and fill with popcorn), and do an art project.  You can play games that involve relays or guessing.
      Valentine party ideas would be similar but adapted for Valentine’s Day.  Check with the teacher and find out if they will be trading Valentine cards before the party or during the party.  Take collections for the party and plan games and activities that center around Valentine’s Day.  Enjoy the time with your child and the other kids in their class.
