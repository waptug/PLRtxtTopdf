For many, many years now, copier machines have been a standard fixture in any office or school. They have been around even before computers became popular. Copier machines were primarily used to create black and white duplicates of documents or practically anything that is on paper.

The first copier machines produced were large, bulky contraptions, but because of technological developments, there are many copier machines today that are very compact and yet have much more features than their predecessors.

Copier machines have evolved tremendously over the years. Aside from making duplicates, today's copier machines can also be used for scanning images, collating documents, sending facsimiles, and so many other functions. Here are only a few of the common uses of copier machines today:

1. Copier machines can make colored copies of documents or images.

2. They can enlarge or reduce the size of your document according to your preference.

3. They can print page numbers of the duplicates that you are making.

4. They can also print on a variety of paper sizes and colors.

5. Many presentations and brochures today are printed from copier machines.

With these features and so much more, there is absolutely no doubt that copier machines are vital in making office work much faster and more organized.

Although copier machines seem to be able to do it all, they still need the right kind of maintenance to function well. Minor repairs like fixing paper jams and changing toner cartridges can be handled by anyone in the office.

However, a copier machine technician has to take care of the major problems. The technician also needs to check your copier machine at least once a year.

It is really amazing when you think about how far copier machines have advanced over the decades. If you think they are just for making copies of your paperwork, think again. With all their capabilities, it is not surprising if offices of the future will be revolving around them.
