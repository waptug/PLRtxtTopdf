Reflexive Verbs and Reflexive Pronouns

This Spanish Grammar online topic covers Reflexive Verbs and Reflexive Pronouns. In Spanish, a verb is considered reflexive if the subject (the performer of the action) and the object (the receiver of the action)

are the same.

 

Here’s an example of a reflexive verb being used in English:

 

I wash myself.

 

In the above sentence the verb “wash” is considered reflexive because the subject or the one performing the action (“I”) and the object or the one receiving the action (“myself”) are the same. On the other hand, if I said “I wash the baby,” the verb “wash” is no longer reflexive because  the subject or the one performing the action (“I”) and the object or the one receiving the action (“baby”) are not the same.

 

Spanish reflexive verbs consist of a verb and a reflexive pronoun.

The following are reflexive pronouns or objects of reflexive verbs.

 

            me        myself

            te         yourself (tú form)

            se         yourself (usted form)

            nos       ourselves

            se         themselves, yourselves

 

When there is just one verb in the sentence, the reflexive pronoun must come before the reflexive verb. 

 

            Me baño.

            I wash myself

 

However, when there are two verbs in the sentence, the reflexive pronoun either comes right before the first verb or follows the second verb.

 

            Quiero bañarme.

            I want to wash myself.

 

            Me quiero bañar.

            I want to wash myself.

 

Here are some examples using reflexive verbs.

 

           

            Me afeito

I shave myself

 

            Te duchas

            You take a shower

 

            Se llama Juan

            He calls himself John

 

            Nos dormimos

            We fall asleep

 

            No nos sentamos

            We don’t sit down

 

            Se enojan

            They get mad

 

            Se levantan

            All of you get up 

           

            Te cepillas los dientes

            You brush your teeth.

 

Literally, “los dientes” means “the teeth” and not “your teeth.” Since we are using the reflexive pronoun “te” it is obvious whose teeth we are talking about.

            mirarse                         to look at oneself
