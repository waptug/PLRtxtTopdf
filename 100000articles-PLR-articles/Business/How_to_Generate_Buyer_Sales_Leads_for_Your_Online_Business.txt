Article Body:
When starting an online business, you need qualified buyer sales leads to reach your target audience. Leads are people who are interested in your products or services, and may potentially become paying customers. There are two types of leads: fresh and stale. Fresh leads are those who have recently purchased similar products or at least have recently shown interest in your field. Stale leads are those who may have shown interest or made a similar purchase in the past, but are not necessarily interested now.

When seeking sales leads for an online business, you'll want to use processes that will generate fresh leads. When considering a new business opportunity, buyer sales leads should be within reach so you'll have a solid start in marketing your business. Otherwise, you might have a difficult time making the business work. 

How to Obtain Buyer Sales Leads Online

There are several ways to obtain buyer sales leads online. You can purchase sales leads from a company that specializes in generating leads. You can visit various websites that are similar to yours (not competitors), and form a joint venture to advertise in their newsletter or at their website. You can also generate leads through auctions and classified advertising online. Obviously, the fastest way to get buyer sales leads is to purchase a list of leads. But keep in mind that the more targeted the list, the more expensive it will be. Also, spamming is frowned upon, so be careful in "how" you contact leads and follow all e-mail anti-spam laws.

Business Ideas to Generate Your Own Buyer Sales Leads

If you own a home business or want to try a business opportunity, buyer sales leads can be generated through your own efforts as well. There are many ways to do this. Start your own website and place a subscription form for a free newsletter and/or site updates on all of your pages. This will generate leads from your own visitors, though it will take some time to build a solid list. You can e-mail your list several times a month manually using your own bulk e-mail software or send automatic follow-ups through an e-mail list service. You can also offer a free mini-course at your site, which is sent to each visitor automatically when they sign-up.

Another way to generate sales leads is by writing articles and submitting them to article directories. Write about subjects that would interest your potential customers, and then place a link to your newsletter subscription page at the conclusion of the article. You can generate leads through pay-per-click search engines. Also, start a contest or drawing. Many people will sign up to win something! 

For off-line lead generation, purchase a list of targeted fresh leads, and send direct mail such as sales letters or postcards. You can also generate leads through radio or television advertising, magazines, or newspapers. 

Be sure to target your audience precisely and offer something they would be interested in, such as home business tips for the home business owner or a list of work from home jobs for those who want to work from home. You might offer a list of business opportunities to opportunity seekers. Offer free home decor ideas if selling home decor products, or free gardening tips if selling garden supplies or plants and flowers. The list of opportunities goes on and on.

Use these online business ideas to generate buyer sales leads and watch your business soar to new heights!
