A woman’s closet would be incomplete if it lacks her favorite lingerie. Lingerie for most women spells out fun, sexy and nice. For some, it is even worth spending some extra dollars for.

Reality is shopping for lingerie is not as easy as picking a kilo of salt in the supermarket, for a woman of any size. Eighty-five percent of women do not wear the right bra size for their body.

For plus size women, this problem is more emphasized. Have your bra size measured when going to a lingerie store so that you would be sure you are wearing the bra with the right cup size and length of the strap. Furthermore, bring some of your tops that differ in their fit in you to try them on over your bra.

NOTE: An ill-fitting bra could make you look heavier or fatter. Consider the fit of the underband, cup and length of the strap.  The underband shold support your breasts. The cup should be the right fit. The length of the strap should be appropriate for your body’s shape and not exert any pressure on your breasts.

Bras with underwire provide the best support, especially for women with big breasts. However, this seems uncomfortable sometimes. Thus, look for a bra with a flat and paddedd underwire.

It is important to wear good bras because bad bras may cause tearing of breast tissue. This would cause the sagging of your breasts. Thus, buy bras, which provide good support for your breasts.
