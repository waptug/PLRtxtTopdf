A debt free life is a dream to many debtors. There are many options available today for you to get rid of your credit card debt, but the keys to success are your patient and consistency to carry out the plan in your selected option. This article will discuss on one of credit card debt solutions called Credit Counseling. 

<b>What is Credit Counseling?</b> 

Credit counseling was introduced by federal government to provide counseling services and help you to find out what steps you could take in order to relieve from your debt. The credit counseling companies will assist you to set up a payback plan that will help you to get out of debt within a certain years. 

The credit counseling agencies are designed to be non-profit, which means majority of your payments must be earmarked for debt payment. However, credit counseling agencies can legally collect a small fee for administrative costs, but most of the counseling services&#39; fees are paid by the lenders themselves, which send back to the services a portion of the payments received. 

<b>How Does Credit Counseling Work?</b> 

Typically, counseling services help you to negotiate lower payments with credit-card companies. Before a credit counselor proposes to you a repayment plan, he normally will do some assessment on your current financial status and get detail information on your debt condition. 

Your counselor can then map out different ways to debt consolidation, potentially pushing all or most of your outstanding balances onto one or two low interest cards or even taking out a debt consolidation loan to get rid of some or all of your credit card debt. 

<b>When Do You Need Credit Counseling?</b> 

If you are able to pay your bills and are current on all your accounts, you almost certainly don&#39;t need credit counseling. If your interest rates are too high, you usually can negotiate a lower rate with your credit-card companies just by asking or threatening to move your account elsewhere. 

You will need credit counseling if: 
<ul>
	<li>You can&#39;t pay the minimums on your credit cards.</li>
</ul><ul>
	<li>You&#39;re consistently late paying one or more of your regular bills.</li>
</ul><ul>
	<li>You&#39;re being hounded by creditors and collection agencies.</li>
</ul><ul>
	<li>Your efforts to work out reasonable repayment plans with your creditors have failed.</li>
</ul>
If you are too serious in dept, a credit counseling service may not able to successfully help to negotiate with credit card companies for a payment that will give you breathing room or get you out of debt. If that is true, bankruptcy may be the best of bad options. 

<b>In Summary</b> 

If you have unbearable credit card debt and the harassing creditor phone calls have made you in deeply stress which causes you can&#39;t think of an idea or a way to settle your credit card debt, a credit counseling service should be able to help you. By going through credit counseling process, you will have a better picture on the options available to you to get rid of your debt; enroll to propose payback plan that best suit you financial capability.
