Running a household is not easy. Between keeping up with children and pets, maintaining sanitary conditions in and around the home, and providing your family with a nurturing environment, housekeeping is one of the hardest jobs around. So how is it that you can spend all day cleaning, and your house still does not have a fresh scent? Even with the best cleaning and laundry agents, everyone needs things that eliminate odors from time to time.

If you have pets and children, you know that odors come with the territory. But other odor-causing elements can create smells that linger long after the source of the smell is gone. Take cooking, for example. If you spend a great deal of time in the kitchen, you may be releasing smells into your home that do not disappear just because the leftovers have been eaten. Fragrant vegetables, hearty stews, dishes made with fish, all of these are odor-causing meals that can linger, not only in your kitchen, but in the furniture, carpet, and curtains of your home. And just because a dish smells good when you are cooking does not mean that the remaining scent will be as attractive. Often, the smell that a delicious meal leaves behind is anything but appetizing. If you are a frequent cook, look into some things that eliminate odors in the kitchen before they reach the rest of the house.

A room freshener is good place to start. Many fresheners come in spray form, allowing you to use them on an as needed basis. Among things that eliminate odors, liquid air fresheners (Liquid Air Freshener – Rainforest) are known as long-lasting and easily dispersed through the air because they are made with scented oils. When you create a particularly fragrant meal, simply use your air freshener as you go, spraying periodically to restore a fresh scent to your home. 

Also keep in mind that if you, your family members, or your guests smoke in the house, even one cigarette or cigar can create a stale smell that rides on the smoke and embeds itself in your upholstery, destroying the fresh scent you worked so hard to achieve. A long history of smoking indoors can create a difficult odor problem that may call for things that eliminate odors on a daily basis.

Pets are a source of joy and constant companionship. Most pet owners believe that they are well worth the time and effort it takes to maintain their health and happiness. Unfortunately, many pet owners forget that maintaining the home’s freshness against persistent pet odors is also necessary. We have all walked into a home and immediately smelled the pet odors that linger in every room, making it obvious that the owners, though diligent in their pet care, have neglected to include things that eliminate odors in their daily cleaning regimen.

For persistent smells like pet odor and stale smoke, a daily upkeep of your home’s air quality is advisable. Look for a room freshener that provides a continuous fresh scent and can stand up to the everyday smells created by smoking or pets. 

One concern that many people have is what to use to eliminate odor on furniture. Upholstery holds onto smells when it has been exposed to adverse conditions. You can do a sniff test to see how strong the smells are and to help you determine what to use to eliminate odor on furniture in each area of your home. You may be able to use a spray deodorizer or simply vacuum the smell away if it is mild. When determining what to use to eliminate odor on furniture though, it helps to know if the odors come from a stain or are embedded in the entire piece. Stains can be treated with a good one-step upholstery cleaner. 

If the source of the smell is not a stain, to truly restore a fresh scent to your upholstery, you may need to take some time to clean it. When you have decided what to use to eliminate odor on furniture, keep in mind the type of fabric you have and how long it will take the cleaner to dry before you make a purchase.

Overall, there are some very efficient and cost-effective things that eliminate odors in your home. If you have trouble diagnosing your own needs, ask a trusted friend or relative to come over and give you an honest opinion. Often, people become accustomed to the smells in their homes, even the bad ones. Remember not to be offended by their comments. Instead, use the feedback to find things that eliminate odors for good. And then take a deep breath for a job well done.
