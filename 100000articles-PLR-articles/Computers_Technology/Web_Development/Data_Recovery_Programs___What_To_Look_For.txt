The easiest way to avoid losing your data to a computer crash or sabotage is to have the means to recover it. No matter how safe you think you are, a data recovery program will  protect you from being blindsided.

A data recovery program will function as an insurance policy so that even if your data is lost, you know that it isn’t destroyed and that you can retrieve it in functional condition.  Having a data recovery program will let you, after you’ve addressed the glitch in your operating system, fully access your lost data.

Data recovery programs are both reasonably-priced and easily installed on your PC. If you run an Internet search, you will even find some data recovery freeware programs which you can download at no cost to your PC. Free data recovery programs, however, may be limited in their scope; if so, you’ll have to do some research to find one with all the features you require. Or, you can look for two or three of them and assemble a data recovery “toolkit.”

Choosing Features For Your Data Recovery Program

What features should you look for in a data recovery program? The very best ones will allow you to recover even compressed and encrypted files, files deleted from your Recycle Bin, of files stored on a hard drive, DVD, or compact discs the sectors for which have become damaged. It should recover files lost due to virus and worm attacks or power failures. Good data recovery software will even bring back your deleted e-mails, and make images of your hard drive to speed the data recovery process.

The best data recovery programs will recover data from both internal and external hard drives, or that was lost after formatting. In short, a good data recovery program will have been written to bail you out of situations which may seem inconceivable, but have happened to enough people that they merit data recovery software.
