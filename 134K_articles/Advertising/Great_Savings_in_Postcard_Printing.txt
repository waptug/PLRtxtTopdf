Every penny counts. This is the reason why I am cautious where to spend it. We need to be a spend-thrift, not simply because it is wise but because it is a must. 
I am into postcards and every once in a while I am tasked to take charge of the whole process - from the conceptualization up to printing. If you are to see it in a packaging it may seem a pretty taxing process. In fact, the entire thing takes a lot of effort and money. Nonetheless, it may also be on the contrary.

Printing rate is a big factor that you need to consider in dealing with postcards. Many postcard designs are 'ganged' in order to save on both money and time. Ganging print dramatically slashes the price of each printing job at a faster printing process. Basically, that is hitting two birds at the same time. 

Ganging print goes like this, if you are going to print 12 different postcard designs on different sheets, in ganging it will be run through the press just once. By now, you can see the effect. 

Another consideration that can help you is to find a commercial printer that gives a good postcard printing deal. There are available discount postcard printing deals in the business these days. Grab the opportunity to save more.

In connection to mailing postcards, postage rate can be pretty affordable. In fact, first class mail is only 23 cents. If you are to compare it with mailing letters, it is 14 cents lower. However, if you are choosing mailing some requirements must be met by your postcards. One of the requirements is the final trim size of 5 to 6 inches in length and 1-1/2 to 4-1/4 inches in height. This postcard rate includes double postcards that have reply cards.

If you opt to make postcards online, you can use ready-made templates to save time. There are thousands of them online. All you have to do is download them. By that process, designing will be made easy and will not eat your time. 

To make it even easier, you can upload your own mailing list from several file formats. Check this mailing list against your official post office records. Change any errors to preclude you from spending further on invalid addresses. Finally, save your mailing list for future use.
