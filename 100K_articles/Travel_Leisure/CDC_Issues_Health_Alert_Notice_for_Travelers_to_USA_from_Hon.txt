The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) on Saturday began distributing cards at airports receiving flights returning directly from Hong Kong warning travelers returning to the United States from Hong Kong & Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China & Hanoi, Vietnam that they may have been exposed to cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

The cards are being handed out by quarantine officials at Chicago, O'Hare International Airport; Los Angeles; old York City, JFK International Airport; Newark; & San Francisco. These airports are the only U.S. airports receiving direct flights from Hong Kong. No U.S. airports receive direct flights from Hanoi or the Guangdong Province. CDC officials expect to expand the distribution of cards to Anchorage, Alaska & the territory of Guam later today.

The cards also offer guidance designed to assist physicians in making a diagnosis by advising travelers to tell their physicians about recent travel to the affected regions, & whether they've been in contact with individuals who displayed symptoms of SARS.

The travel cards warn those returning from the three areas that they should monitor their health for at least three days. they're also advised to contact their physicians if they become ill with a fever accompanied by a cough or difficulty in breathing.
