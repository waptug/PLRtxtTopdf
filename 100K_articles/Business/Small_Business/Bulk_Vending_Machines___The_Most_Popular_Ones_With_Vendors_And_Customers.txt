Bulk vending machines are everywhere. It is what you sell through these machines that will make or break your business. Of course, the location is important as well, but there are so many different kinds of candy and other products you can sell through the vending machines that it is hard to decide what you should start with. Candy and giant gumballs go over well, as do the bulk vending machines that sell a prize. 

There are almost as many bulk vending distributors as there are products that you can sell. These distributors have different models of bulk candy machines. Some of them are single machines, but you can get combo machines where you sell three different products in one machine. The reason they are called bulk vending machines is that they can hold a lot of candy or other products, which means you don’t have to restock them as often.

Usually bulk candy machines dispense a handful of small candy. Although the candy doesn’t last very long, it is a thrill for small children to put in a quarter and receive the candy. They will often want to spend more than one quarter in the bulk vending machines because they are amazed at how it works. You will most likely see these machines where parents take small children, even though adults like the candy from the vending machines too. 

Bulk vending distributors will be able to supply you with large quantities of candy for your vending machine business. The candy usually comes in 30 pound bags, so you have enough candy to refill the vending machines several times. The cost of the bulk candy is about $50 a box, which means that you will have a high rate of profit when you sell them all. The bulk vending machines of this nature are not expensive either and you can save money on your investment if you look for used bulk candy machines. 

Bulk vending machines are perfect for people who want to start their own small business as a second source of income. You won’t have to service them very often, so using bulk candy machines won’t take up a lot of your time. There are very few parts that can break on these vending machines because the main components are the turning knob and the coin receptacle. When you add in the fact that they do not require electricity, business owners can easily make money on your investment when they allow you to place bulk vending machines at their place of business.
