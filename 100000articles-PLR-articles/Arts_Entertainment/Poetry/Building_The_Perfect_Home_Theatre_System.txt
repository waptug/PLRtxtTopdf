Your wife finally said yes. After years of begging on your knees, buying flowers, and taking out the trash you are finally allowed to shop for a home theatre system. Know that you got the chance; do you know what is out there and how to go about buying A/V (audio and video) equipment? Most consumers see the rows of big screen televisions in their big lot stores. They stand there drooling only to find that don’t understand what brand audio will go with the best brand of video. It is a logistic nightmare if you want to learn all the information about the product and then when you get home you don’t know how to set it up.

That is why you should go to a local audio and visual event production professional. Most big lot stores have salesmen that have as much or even less knowledge about audio and visual equipment than you do. They know the electronic catch phrases like contrast and definition, but if you let them loose in your home to build it, you would find that you have bought inferior products and sound quality is way below the price you paid for it. Your audio and visual production professional is both the salesman and the installer. You will receive professional service at reasonable prices and at the same time receive quality in your purchase.

When you walk into a business that knows about the buying and selling of A/V equipment you will find that the salesman knows what he is talking about from the beginning of conversation. He or she will not ask you what you want; they will tell you what you need in accordance to the space you have and the purpose you want home theatre for. They may even schedule a trip to your home to measure the room it is going in and what kind of acoustics you have in that room. Once this is measured they will help you pick out one of the optical front projection screens that will give you the ultimate in viewing pleasure.

The screen will be the right size for the room and the angle will be set to be the viewing angle for the room and your furniture. You might even have to give your’s and your family’s height and where you sit so they can create the right angle for that perfect home theatre system experience. Next they will strategically place the audio equipment around your room to give you that authentic theatre sound. The bass, tenor, and tweak of each speaker will blend into a symphony of sound and excitement as you bring car chases, explosions, and music into your living space that will blow you away.

So don’t depend on the unprofessional experience of a big lot electronic store to set up your home theatre system. Go to the professionals who set up live events such as concerts and business conferences. If they can set up a professional event that is seen by thousands think about what kind of home theatre system they can set up for you.
