How to Find Sci-Fi Collectibles Available For Sale

Sci-fi collecting is a hobby that is enjoyed by individuals of all ages, as well as a hobby that is enjoyed by individuals all around the world.  Science fiction collectors are individuals who specialize in the collecting of science fiction merchandise.  While many sci-fi collectors focus most of their attention on sci-fi figurines and other models, there are many other sci-fi themed items available for sales.  Depending your collecting goals, these items may be of great interest to you.

Once you have decided that you would like to start your own sci-fi collection, you will want to get started with making your purchases.  After all, buying science fiction figurines and other collectable merchandise is the first step in creating a hopefully successful collection.  Regardless of your reasons for collecting, you and all other science fiction collectors are encouraged to familiarize yourselves with your buying options.

One of the best ways to go about finding sci-fi collectibles available for sale is by using the internet to your advantage.  Many science fiction collectors, especially beginners, turn to online auction websites, like eBay.com.  Online auction websites are similar to yard sales, as you never know what you may find.  There are many eBay sellers who resell mass produced sci-fi collectibles, while others have original or limited edition collector pieces available for sale.  

In addition to online auction websites, sci-fi collectors are also urged to search for professional dealers online.  Sci-fi dealers are professionals who buy and sell sci-fi collectables for a profit.  While variations are possible, many sci-fi dealers have a large selection of rare, limited edition, or special collector sets.  One of the many reasons why sci-fi dealers have the great selection is because of knowledge and research.  Many professional sci-fi dealers get a good idea of what they should accurately charge for rare and valuable collectables by examining availability and average selling prices.  This research often reduces the chances of collectors, like you, paying too much.

Hobby shops are another buying option that many sci-fi collectors have.  Hobby shops are increasing in popularity.  Due to this increase in popularity, many collectors are able to shop for potentially valuable sci-fi collectables locally.  Typically, collectors unable to find what they were looking for from their local hobby shops should still receive assistance.  For example, many hobby shower owners allow their customers to order from on hand catalogues or they give customers the contact information for local or online sci-fi dealers, especially those known to produce great results.

Traditional retail stores, such as department stores and toy stores, are a great source of sci-fi collectables, especially collectables for new collectors or children.  One concern that many collectors have concerning traditional department stores is circulation numbers.  Most department stores carry sci-fi collectibles and other science fiction themed merchandise that went through mass production.  Mass production, which often makes it easy and affordable to find sci-fi collectables, tends to reduce value or make certain collectables worthless.
Another great option, when looking for sci-fi collectables for sale is sci-fi conventions or other events, especially those with a focus on buying, selling and trading.  These events, when scheduled, are often advertised online.  In addition to gaining access to rare and valuable sci-fi collectables from other hobbyists and professional dealers, a lot of knowledge can be retained from these conventions.  Most sci-fi conventions and other events occur on both local and international levels.

As highlighted above, science fiction collectors, just like you, have a number of different ways to go about finding and buying sci-fi collectables available for sale.  If your main purpose is to collect for personal enjoyment, like due to a love for the science fiction genre, be sure to examine local yard sales, estate sales, thrift stores, and auctions, as many older and sometimes hard to find collectables make their ways these locations.  The shape of the collectibles in question will vary, but many collectors in it for the love of science fiction do not care.
