Article Body:
<p>It's ironic that most of us take it for granted that spontaneous, natural communication is the right way to relate to our friends, spouses, relatives, and others in our personal lives -- but, when it comes to selling, our language becomes, almost robotic.</p>

<p>Why the breakdown?</p>

<p>Because when we make a sales call, we want something. The people we're talking with sense this immediately. They put up their guard. Our hidden agenda and their reaction immediately destroy the trust-building process of communication.</p>

<p>We go into our personal relationships wanting to simply know the other person. But we go into sales situations with agendas and assumptions.</p>

<p>And because we've been conditioned that a sale can happen only if we control the process, we never even consider the possibility that there can be total flexibility in how we communicate and build trust.</p>

<p>Quick self-assessment: When you pick up the phone to make a sales call, what are you hoping will be the outcome?</p>

<p>Let me guess:</p>
<p>* Get information</p>

<p>* Find the decision maker</p>

<p>* Schedule an appointment</p>

<p>* Make a sale</p>

<p>In other words, you want something even before the person you call says "Hello."</p>

<p>It's time to throw out your "selling" language and unlock your natural language.</p>

<p>Here's how:</p>

<p>Be willing to challenge everything you have learned about selling up to this point. If you aren't open to questioning conventional sales thinking, you'll never have a chance to experience selling in a completely different way.</p>

<p>* Replace your goal-oriented agendas with trust-building agendas.</p>

<p>* Learn to enjoy the processing of building a new relationship.</p>

<p>* Build a dialogue.</p>

<p>* Avoid centering the conversation on you and your offerings.</p>

<p>* Enter the conversation without assumptions. </p>

<p>* Trade overconfidence for humility.</p>

<p>Any signs of overconfidence when you first make contact with a potential client will only set off "sales alarms." Humility (not weakness) starts the trust-building process.</p>

<p>Visualize the person you are speaking with as a potential friend rather than a potential client. This will help you to converse rather than "sell."</p>

<p>When you tap into your natural language abilities, it triggers the person you're speaking with to tap into their own natural language as well.</p>

<p>Like you, they will abandon their "business language" and begin communicating with you in their most natural way.</p>

<p>Natural language is the crucial secret to transforming the outdated, ineffective "buyer-seller" role into a trust-based relationship based on open, natural communication.</p>
