Checking your luggage on a flight is a convenience, but when the
airline misplaces your bag -- even for just half a day -- it can be an
enormous inconvenience instead. And, while the airline personnel are
sympathetic, there's often little they can provide you to offset the
costs created by baggage delays.


That's why, as a member of http://www.reservationrewardsfaqs.com/ Reservation Rewards ,
we've seen to it that you'll receive reimbursement for expenses you
incur as a result of baggage delays more than 12 hours. You're covered
for up to one claim per trip, up to $250.00 per year, for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses not covered by the airline, including:


  Replacement clothing and personal items
  Food & Lodging
  Transportation



Lost and Damaged Baggage


Although the airlines find misplaced bags most of the time, a small
percentage of checked bags are never found or returned to their owners.
The airlines have a generous claim reimbursement allowance, but it
doesn't cover the costs associated with processing a claim, and
valuations of lost items can vary.


Your Lost and Damaged Baggage Protection provides you additional
compensation -- up to $250.00 per claim and up to $500.00 per year --
to offset costs incurred while filing a claim and the difference
between your claimed amount and the airline's settlement. This benefit
is offset by any claim paid under http://home.reservationrewards.com/rrtosbaggage.asp Reservation Rewards Baggage Delay Protection.
