A growing number of families, girlfriends and guys are finding a beach vacation to be a terrific way to unwind from everyday stress. Some, it could be said, even take that idea to the extreme.

On Florida's Emerald Coast-located on the upper Gulf Coast-visitors can go "Emerald Extreme." From kite-boarding at Choctawhatchee Bay-Florida's number one kite-boarding location-and parasailing 500 feet over the Destin Harbor to fishing 20 miles offshore to catch the perfect king mackerel, the area offers thrill seekers an extreme array of activities before they rest their weary heads and adrenaline-rushed bodies in affordable, Gulf-edged accommodations.

Unleashing a suppressed wild side, gal pals strap in and step up to a 65-foot-high platform to take the plunge at The Track's bungee jump. Families can climb aboard 64-foot fishing boats destined for the deep blue seas, couples can soar to new highs parasailing, while the more adventurous-usually the guys-can catch an extreme ride on a kite-board. Resting after an intense "Emerald Extreme" day, people then enjoy sipping daiquiris while taking in the spectacular view of Destin Harbor.

Voted "Number One Beach in the South" by Southern Living magazine for 11 consecutive years, the pristine beaches of Destin, Fort Walton Beach and Okaloosa Island provide a utopian scenery by which to unwind from lively exploits. With spirited seaside celebrations, undeniably fresh seafood and tempting temperatures year-round, the Emerald Coast remains an ideal getaway for everyone.
