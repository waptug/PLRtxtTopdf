Why Buy A Satellite Cell Phone?

The satellite cell phone is definitely the wave of the future when it comes to mobile communication.  These phones debuted a few years back, and many people did not take them seriously. When these phones first came out, they lacked the range and roaming capabilities of the traditional cell phone that got its feed from local towers. The problem was most cell phone companies were supplying signal via nationwide towers, whereas a satellite cell phone was working off of a single satellite. This presented many problems as far as a quality signal was concerned. The first people to have a satellite cell phone complained about the quality of the calls. But this was when there were not a lot of satellites to get the signal from.

If you fast forward a couple of years, it looks like all cell phones are moving in the direction of satellites. Eventually a satellite cell phone will be able to provide the user with a signal regardless of where they are in the entire world. This is due in part because they will be using a satellite in the sky, as opposed to a tower on the ground. With the current set up, if you are not within the appropriate distance of a network tower, you cannot get the signal needed for service. As more and more satellites are being launched by service providers, the need for a satellite cell phone is going to increase.

A satellite cell phone is also able to have more features than a standard set up. One feature that is coming into its own is the ability of the cell phone to pick up satellite radio. This is going to be a huge selling tool for service providers in the next few years. In addition to being able to play MP3s, a satellite cell phone will also be able to get the signal for XM or Sirius radio.

A satellite cell phone may not be a good buy right now, but eventually this form of mobile communication will take over.
