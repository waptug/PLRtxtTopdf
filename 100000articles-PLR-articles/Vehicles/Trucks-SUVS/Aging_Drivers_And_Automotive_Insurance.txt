If you’re a driver who is aging, it doesn’t mean you are a driver who is facing a lack of automotive insurance. Quite the contrary, if you are a driver who is aging, you could very well be facing discounts in automotive insurance.

Depending on the automotive insurance company through which you are insured, you may be eligible for various discounts. For example, many insurance companies that specialize in more than one kind of insurance will offer discounts to policyholders who purchase more than one insurance policy from them. Many people choose to purchase both their automotive insurance policies and their homeowner’s insurance policies through the same insurance company, which results in a discount in premiums.

Some insurance companies also offer discounts to aging drivers who have good driving records, and for various reasons. Drivers certain ages, usually 50 years of age and older, who have been driving for many years, are viewed as being less of a risk than new drivers – especially if they have good driving records. Aging drivers are seen as more responsible. Plus, aging drivers are less likely to go “joy riding” like younger drivers are, which puts them at less risk for traffic accidents and violations.

Aging drivers who are looking for discounts should follow the same tips as any other driver. Drive a safe car, park it in a safe location, and make sure it has anti-theft safety components. Keep traffic violations and accidents to a minimum, if not nonexistent, and try not to drive a significant number of miles more than necessary a year.

Some automotive insurance companies even offer discounts for aging drivers who participate in driving programs that the insurance companies provide, or participate in with another company. These driving programs are designed to refresh and sharpen driving skills, as well as restore defensive driving tactics.

So, the next time you worry about automotive insurance because you’re an aging driver, stop!
