<b>Embroidered T-Shirts Become Messengers</b>

In 1948, presidential candidate Thomas Dewey produced the "Dew It for Dewey" t-shirt and in 1952 came "I Like Ike" t-shirts. Film stars appeared on TV wearing these t-shirts. Other factors also influenced the trend and gradually, the t-shirt gained acceptance as normal wear.

Embroidered t-shirts with sports team logos and messages, identifying their wearers as the team fans, are hugely popular. This is an excellent example of the relationship between t-shirts and brands.

In this case the popularity of these shirts would appear to come from the demand side – from the team fans. Such fan loyalty, however, will be available only to teams that perform well, however.

Advertisers were soon attracted to the new medium for sending out their brand-building messages. Embroidered t-shirts have been displaying advertising messages for two or three decades now.

The most striking trend with embroidered t-shirts has been the increasingly humorous and wacky messages that they display. These have reached a level where many people find the messages offending.

One thing is for certain; embroidered t-shirts with all kinds of messages and/or pictures are here to stay.

<b>Conclusion</b>

And people in general have used embroidered t-shirts to express their own views about everything, in increasingly humorous and wacky ways.
