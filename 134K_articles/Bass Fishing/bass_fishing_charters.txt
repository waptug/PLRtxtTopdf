Below is a list of the things that you should be reminded of when you plan to have a charter. See for yourself.

• You must have a fishing license so that you will be authorized to take or possess either saltwater or freshwater fish and have a chance to participate fishing games but you should be mindful that we are consistent with the state and federal regulations.  Securing a fishing license also contribute in ensuring the future of fishing in the state where we have the activity.

• It is also advisable that we wear a soft soled shoe for our comfort.  Boots, especially those that are intended for work, are big NO-NOs.

• Bring with you seasickness pills if you that it is needed.  It is important that you pack up enough of it for the whole trip.  You should make it sure that you are physically fit before going into a charter for you to enjoy every minute.

• Being on a charter means being exposed to the sun so you should not forget to have your sunglasses with you for protection. 

• Coolers should also go with the trip.  This is intended for the fishes that are going to get caught.  It is one of the vital things that we should not fail to remember for the reason that it would help retain the freshness of the fish.  You do not want to have a spoiled-looking fish right?

• Check the weather forecast of the day.  You would surely want to go out if the sun is up right?  But you should always bring with you rain gear for special purposes.  You should always expect for a sudden change of condition.

Well, what else should you bring?

Food, of course.  You will be out there in the middle of the sea or lake so you better bring enough food and beverage for all of you because, for sure, you do not want to eat raw fish or gulp the salty water when you get hungry and thirsty, right?

To add up, have your camera, video cam or the like so you will have something that would remind you of your trip anytime you want. Be sure that you have all of these things to have a really pleasurable trip while you are in the fly fishing charter.
