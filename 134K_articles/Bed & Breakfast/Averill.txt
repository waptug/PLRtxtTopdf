Averill's Flathead Lake Lodge

A family vacation beyond your wildest dreams awaits you at Averill's Flathead Lake Lodge in Bigfork, Montana.  

This ranch covers two thousand acres in the Rocky Mountains, just south of Glacier National Park.  The ranch is family operated, so they know what a family is searching for.  This is evident right down to the rates, which are different for each age group.  The categories are divided into adult, thirteen to nineteen, six to twelve, three to five and under three.  All rates include meals and various activities.

The activities available include supervised children's activities for kids from six through teenagers.  Families can enjoy horseback riding, lake cruising and trail hiking.  If you've ever wanted to know what it was like to work on an authentic dude ranch, here's your chance-visitors can participate in cattle roping and various other workings around the corral.

This isn't the end of the activities by far.  There is a heated pool, rec room and private beach.  Why not try your hand at white water rafting?  The water is also available for lake cruises, boating, raft trips and water skiing.  There is a private beach at your disposal, complete with picnic tables and grills.

For horse lovers, riding instruction, horse competitions, team roping, team penning and even a family style rodeo are just some of the fun events offered in the rodeo area.  Riders will enjoy morning, evening, and half-day rides through mountain country and rolling timberland with spectacular vistas.

If all this weren't enough, there are barn dances, a children's overnight campout, a bonfire on the beach, complete with s'mores and singalongs, and much more. After a day of all that activity, you can even get a massage for those tired muscles. This is truly one vacation spot the whole family can enjoy together!!
