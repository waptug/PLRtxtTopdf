When it comes to slot machines everyone is an expert. They will tell you all sorts of tricks about how to pick a winning slot machine, but check to see what kind of car this "expert" is driving.

If it is so easy to pick a winning slot machine then why are they driving a 15 year old car covered with rust? The real truth of the matter is that slot machines are designed to take your money. Yes, if you play a machine long enough you will eventually win that big jackpot, but chances are you will be broke by then. Here is a look at some of the Myths about picking a slot machine.

1. You can tell how loose a slot machine is by its location on the casino floor. This just is not true every slot machine will go thru a loose period and a tight period. No one knows when a loose run will start on a machine or how long it will last, and I promise you unless the casino suspects that the machine is malfunctioning they do not shuffle the slot machines around the casino depending on how they are paying out. Now machines do have a pay out percentage this is how much on average a winning spin will pay out and they will locate the better paying machines in areas to attempt to draw you in, but you have no better chances of winning on these machines then on any other.

2. Slot Machines pay out better during off hours to draw players in when it's slow in the casino. If this were true then the casinos would have to be rigging the machines and adjusting the odds and that would be illegal. Slot machines have their odds and computer software checked by independent monitoring groups to ensure that nothing has been tampered with and that at any time of the day, week, month and year you have the same chance of winning.

3. Using a casino club card will lower your chances of winning. There are lots of folks who actually believe this is true and miss out on hundreds of dollars in free comps from the casinos because they think the club cards reduce your chances of winning and by making any wins smaller then they would have been without the card. the casinos give you comps when you win in order to get you to play longer so you will lose the money you just won and hopefully some extra as well, so them cheating you from winning will actually cost them money in the long run, besides again being illegal.

Slot machines are designed to make money for the house, but they are fair. Today's modern slot machines use a Random Number Generator to constantly be generating possible outcomes on the machine. The computer inside the slot machine will go thru hundreds of outcomes every second and the exact moment you press the spin button the outcome is selected by whatever is currently in the RNG. So every spin has the chance to win you a fortune and if you play long enough you will eventually get that exact right moment.
