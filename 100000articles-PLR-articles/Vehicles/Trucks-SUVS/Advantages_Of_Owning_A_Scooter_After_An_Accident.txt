If you have been in an accident and you have a leg in a cast, or perhaps you have both legs in a cast, a scooter will be your leg! You can get from room to room at school or in the home. A scooter is going to put your back into action, giving you the ability to do things for yourself, without having to wait for someone to do something for you. Use a scooter to get to school, to get to church, to get to the store, or get out in the driveway and soak in some sun if you have the urge.

Advantages Of Owning A Scooter
After an accident, you want to do things but can’t move around too well. You can use a scooter to get out, get to work, get to the store and see the doctor without having to use crutches or a manual wheel chair. A scooter is going to fold up, and you can store it in a closet, by your bed, or in the van. After you are healed, and you are walking again, putting the scooter away in storage in the house is always a good idea.
