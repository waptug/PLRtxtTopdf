When it comes to taking care of your teeth, purchasing the proper dental insurance is essential. Dental insurance really comes in handy for those who cannot deal with the increasing costs of seeing a dentist. The decision to select dental insurance that is right for individuals or families (depending on the situation) becomes an important task to conclude. 

Whether you are buying dental insurance through your place of business or looking for independent options, it is vital to analyze a variety of plans to ensure you are getting the best deal. Many different factors listed below may come into play when making a final selection. 

Affordability

When selecting dental insurance, it is important to compare yearly maximum coverage on a regular basis. The amount in benefits that a plan will pay in one full year is one of the most important aspects to choosing the best dental insurance plan. Yearly maximums also renew on an automatic basis every year. It is also important to know that anything not used within a year will not roll over into the next. Many dental insurance companies only allow an average yearly max of $1000.  

Dentists

In the case of independent dental insurance, most plans will only cover your dental services if they are administered from a dentist that is contracted or participating in their network. It is important to find out if you are required to receive your dental work from a participating dentist. Some plans may allow individuals to stay with their current dentists, but checking the policy for these allowances is essential. 

Major Coverage 

Dental insurance companies separate their dental procedures into three different categories. When comparing plans, you should ask about their policies regarding preventative, major, and restorative work. Varying dental companies will view different dental procedures in many different ways. For example, one dentist may consider root canals and crowns a major procedure while another will not. This is important to know before choosing a dental insurance plan. 

Waiting Periods

The length of time that an insurance company will make you wait before you can enjoy coverage is called the waiting period. For example, some plans hold policies that make you wait 12 months or longer before you are covered for a crown. 

Cosmetic Dentistry 

If you are interested in seeing your dentist for any cosmetic procedures, such as teeth whitening or bleaching, you should know dental insurance companies rarely cover cosmetic dentistry. For the few that do, prepare for high rates.
