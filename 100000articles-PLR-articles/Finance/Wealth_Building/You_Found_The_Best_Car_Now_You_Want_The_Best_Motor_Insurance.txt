The quote you get for the motor insurance premium will depend on several factors and these include your age, your sex, the size of the car that you drive and the type of car. Of course there are many more factors that have to be taken into account when taking motor insurance and looking for the best deal, but there are ways that you can help to keep the cost down yourself. 

Parking your car on a drive by the side of the house or parking your car in a garage can often reduce the cost of the quotes you are given, you can also reduce the premiums by having an excellent driving record, for even one point on your licence can boost the premiums up. If you have no claims bonus also called NCD  -No Claims Discount) then this will also help to reduce the premiums as will installing extra security features, particularly if they are ones that are recommended by motoring organisations.
 
The size of the car that you choose will also determine in the quote for the premiums and unless you really need a big flashy car then choose your new car wisely. A car with a bigger engine size and one that is considered to be a sporty model will cost more to insure than will a more sedate, family model with a smaller engine.

If you want the best motor insurance then you simply have to let a specialist website shop around on your behalf and present you with the cheapest quotes.
