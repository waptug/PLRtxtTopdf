Article Body:
The search engines play a major part in online marketing. SEO (search engine optimization) services are provided by marketing companies to help you gain targeted traffic through Google, Yahoo!, MSN, and other major or minor search engines. But are SEO services good or bad for your business? Should you use a marketing company's SEO services or try to "woo" the search engines into picking you as a leader and an authoritative company all on your own? Here are some things to consider.

SEO Services can be Valuable

Unfortunately as a business owner, you usually are torn between two important aspects of your business - promotion and operation. You've probably heard this phrase many times... "You are too busy working in your business to work on your business." This statement still holds true with Internet business. Whether you are offering services to a small group of clients, have a giant corporation, or own an online retail store, you face the same dilemma. 

Using another company's SEO services can benefit you in several ways. One, it frees your time for other important matters. Two, you are able to receive help from someone who spends all their time analyzing and testing the search engines for results. They already know what it could take you years to learn! Three, you can save time and money for other types of promotions if you're not spending all your time trying to race your competitors to the top of the listings.

Things to Look for in SEO Services and an SEO Firm

SEO services can include many different types of services such as keyword density help for all your web pages, search engine submission, search engine optimization to target certain areas of the world or your country or state, and/or content writing services. For example, the company may offer UK search engine optimisation if your market generally lives in the U.K. They might write keyword-rich articles for you or provide you with a steady list of new keywords you can add to your site pages to make your site more search engine friendly.

Choose an SEO service that provides the most value for your money. Be sure they have experience in SEO rankings and can provide you with a valid list of company references that you can contact if needed. Check with the Better Business Bureau online to be sure the company doesn't have excessive customer complaints.

Also, choose a company that offers proof that their system has worked in the past. There are no guarantees that any system will work every time, but having proof of past successes will give you peace of mind that the company really knows its stuff. Talk with the SEO consultant to find out how they plan to improve your search engine rankings ahead of time. Ask them to explain the process to you.

Beware of Scams

If an SEO company makes amazing promises such as those promising to get your site listed at the top of Google under your major keyword within 30 days for only $19.95, this should be a red flag. This promise is unrealistic, especially if your business is brand new. Also, the company cannot actually "guarantee" a top listing. They can only guarantee that your site will get listed under some of your major keywords. You might attract traffic under hundreds of keywords after using legitimate SEO services.

The one thing to remember about SEO services is that it must be an ongoing process. Don't expect any SEO firm to work miracles overnight. They must analyze your business, study your market, find suitable keywords for your business, and begin a series of changes to optimize your site for the best possible results.
