Gone are the days when you used the audio tape to record the voice. The all new digital voice recorders have made all to forget the conventional tape and have offered us more features than we can use.

So a tape is now obsolete and has been taken over by the digital voice recorders. This small gadget has been quite useful since its launch and a great boon for professionals as well. So if there is a need to record voice, a digital recorder is what you should look for.

These new age voice recorders come as a handy solution for the busy business people who need to record notes, meetings, and ideas that can create a fuss if a tape would be used, instead of the voice recorder. A digital recorder is not all about recording voice, but it also has the capability to record and transfer information to your computer, making it easier to organize, edit and play back your voice files wherever you want.

With the increasing popularity of the digital recorders, there are many leaders in the electronics industry like Sony, Panasonic, Samsung, LG that provide the best voice recorders with the digital technology. But while buying a digital voice recorder, there are a few aspects involved in the selection of the best that you need to understand beforehand. So lets understand what a digital voice recorder is all about.

Look for the recording time.

Many voice recorders boast of the recording time by claiming the higher side of it. The recording time depends on the quality of recording and the higher the audio quality the lower the recording time would be. So rather than looking for a recorder that claims 300 Hrs of recording, look for the real picture of the recording time it can give with the highest quality.

Look for more storage options

Apart from voice files many digital recorders can store files, documents and images. These are equipped with the USB mass support class that helps them to store these files. Now with the storage comes the organizer, which is also an important feature to look for. Be sure that the digital recorder will store voice files in a minimum of three separate folders.

Look for voice recording features

The best of the voice recorders also exhibit many ‘smart' features that help you with the operations. Some of the interesting features you can find in the latest digital recorders are voice activation, which stops recording automatically whenever there is a long pause, or the cue/review feature that make it easier for you to find a particular recording part you want to play back.

It can also have a LCD screen for better operations. Some of the latest voice recorders also include software, which helps in converting the audio in a text file helping you with the transcription.

Look for connectivity

Like any other latest gadget the digital recorders are equipped with USB interface for PC connectivity. It helps a lot in transfer of files from the recorder to PC and vice versa.
