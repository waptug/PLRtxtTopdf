Article Body:
Montclair State University is mandating freshmen have a cell phone.  This gives the school the opportunity to determine where the student is at any time.  When this process began, the students were not really happy but, now, the students realize that this voluntary tracking system provides more safety.  This gives the school a better way to contact students and maintain a line of communication.

Some schools are eliminating lines and jacks from their dormitories.  Previously the schools were making money on these services.  Since more and more students don’t connect the phones, this effectively eliminated income and became a cost for initial installation.  

The University of Cincinnati has a voluntary program offering all incoming freshmen a free mobile phone.  The phone features the school mascot, Bearcat, on the welcome screen.  Some colleges are sticking with traditional phone service.  Perhaps they are worried that cellular service isn’t as reliable. 

In the future VOIP technology could be a viable alternative.  Many colleges now have broadband access which would make this a feasible way to go.

Richard Stockton College of New Jersey is expanding its housing.  The new housing will be equipped with a computer network that is wireless.  

While the choices are many, it appears that colleges are making use of modern technology and looking to the future to make more innovative changes.
