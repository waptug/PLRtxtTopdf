More and more people are beginning to hear about FOREX trading. FOREX stands for FOreign Currency EXchange Market. It was once available only to the large banks, multinational corporations, governments,and other financial markets and institutions; however it was de-regulated in 1997, and now anyone may participate.  

Many with experience in stocks and/or commodities trading who have then discovered FOREX, prefer it for its many advantages over stock and commodity trading. Many who have never invested before are also now  
successfully trading the FOREX market.

The FOREX market is open 24 hours a day, except weekends, so you can participate whenever you have time. Trading is now done online and transactions are almost instantaneous.

The FOREX market offers 100:1 leverage, so you can control large amounts of money on the market while using much less of your own money. You can start with a mini-account for as little as $300, and with a strategy, steadily build your account and confidence, until you can open a regular account. You can grow that $300 seed to substantially more money in 6 months with the right application of sound strategy. And, you can set the level of  risk you're willing to accept; and you can do this with very minimal risk.

FOREX is the world's largest, most liquid trading market. It is the best trending market, moving in the same direction (up or down) over 78% of the time, and you can learn to profit on either trend. Technical analysis works very well in this market, and there are many tools that aid in this.

Because most FOREX trading is focused on 7 major currencies, you have much less to learn than when trading stocks or commodities.  Of course you'll want to learn as much as you can about FOREX, but this can be done to your satisfaction much sooner than you might think. There are many training courses and also lots of free information available on this subject.

FOREX trading is fun and challenging, and FOREX is quickly becoming one of the investing world's hottest, most rewarding opportunities.
