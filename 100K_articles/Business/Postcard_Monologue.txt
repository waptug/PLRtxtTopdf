Article Body:
I have existed and survived for decades and decades now. Though there has been several medium swarming in the community, my value cannot be understated. 

At first, I was used as a medium to carry simple notes and keep relatives and friends connected. I can break distance, run a mile, swim across oceans and fly underneath the horizon to give your dear ones timely message and the usual hi’s and hello’s.

As years pass by, I was a bit depressed by the fact that I almost was forgotten by the people who once adored me. They shifted to the modern means made available for them. This fact made me sad. I was there longing for the attention to return by all means.

To my delight, the discovery of incorporating pictures and images gave me my most wanted return to the limelight. With the innovation, I looked stunning and entertaining. Landscape, seascape, still life – name it, I got them in my face. Funny, inspirational, satirical, enthralling…whoa! I can handle them all!

Nowadays, I still am embracing the limelight. Savvy businessmen and marketers are using me for improved purposes like advertising and promotions. I was instantly converted into a multi-purpose work of art.

To keep my aficionados, I would like to advice them several things about postcard printing and mailing. This is my way of thanking them…

First, do repeat postcard mailing. One big shot is not enough. Hence, continuous boost is indispensable. 

Second, choose not according to price but quality. The best price does not entail the best catch. Ask around to form a good choice of postcard printing and mailing services.

Third, in doing marketing through postcards, better not have them enclosed in envelopes. Making them readily open can make your message more accessible to more.

Fourth, promote singly. In one postcard design, promote only one product or service. This is to avoid vagueness and confusion. This will also encourage retention.

Finally, using me in your marketing strategy can be the be-all and end-all marketing tool. Get that moving change.
