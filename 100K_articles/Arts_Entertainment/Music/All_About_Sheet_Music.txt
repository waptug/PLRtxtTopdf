Sometimes a play set is so vast that no matter how many times you practice, it’s difficult to remember all the words and chord changes.  Using sheet music as a guide can help you build confidence during a performance.

Sheet music can be found for download at a number of sites.  Sometimes sheet music is available for free, others a small fee is required.

If you are a composer, allowing others to view or download your sheet music is a great way to expose your art to the public.  Use sheet music to learn, write and perform original works and songs by your favorite artists.
