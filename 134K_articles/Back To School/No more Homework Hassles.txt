No more Homework Hassles

	Homework time can be as bad as getting your child to clean their room.  They’ve been at school all day, and they don’t want to sit down and do any more work.  How can you help your child avoid the hassle?	  
	First, establish a specific time each day that is set aside for homework.  Having a routine helps kids know what to expect, and they adjust better.  Check your family schedule to find a time that can work consistently.
	Next, have all items needed for homework in the same area for easy access.  If your child uses a computer to type reports, make it available in any easy location.  Keep a supply of pencils, crayons, paper, and markers – as well as a pencil sharpener, nearby so that your child isn’t spending homework time looking for supplies.  
	If you kids don’t have any homework, have them use the time getting some extra reading done.  Also, help your kids keep track of deadlines for homework projects by writing them out on a calendar or another method of tracking.  
	Younger children will need help with their homework.  It can be very frustrating if they don’t understand something and there is no one to help them.  Make sure that you or someone else is available when they are doing their homework so they can get the answers they need when they need them.
	Make sure your children don’t wait until the last minute to complete their assignments.  It’s a lot of stress for them and you.  I’m sure many parents have spent Sunday night helping their child finish up an assignment they forgot about.  And speaking of forgetting, make sure they get in the habit of putting their homework away for school tomorrow.  No parent likes the phone call asking them to bring something to school that their child forgot.
