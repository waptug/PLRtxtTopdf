Article Body:
Training is essential to any employee and provides not only a benefit to them but also to the company in increased productivity and employee job satisfaction.  The high costs of travel combined with increasing strained budgets have meant that training can sometimes be the first thing to be cut when focusing on the bottom line.  Companies are turning to a more cost-effective solution through online education and e-learning.

Training an employee is essential for any business, whether it be a fast food establishment or a multi-million dollar software company.  One of the most effective ways to train employees is to let them get education at their own pace through e-learning training programs.  Not only does this eliminate costly travel expenses but it also allows the employee to take the training on their own schedule as they are available.  If an employee cannot finish the online education is one sitting they can easily come back to where they left off next time.  Furthermore, if there is a question or a concept the employee does not understand the e-learning system lets them review and go over materials as often as they desire.

One of the foremost designers of e-learning software is Gary Blum Designs.  They have developed online education systems for a number of major companies including Charles Schwab, Cygent and Sybase.  If your company does not have an internal training department then hiring an outside contractor such as Gary Blum Designs can be the best solution for getting quality e-learning materials delivered right to your employees.

Most online education includes quiz and performance evaluation software at the end of the course.  This information can be stored for use by management to see training weak-spots in the company or judge individual performance.  Many times employees can re-take missed quizzes or evaluations and never be asked the same question twice thanks to the technology behind the e-learning application.
