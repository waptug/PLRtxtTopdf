Where do you intend to purchase the necessary accessories?

This is a make it or mar it question. Many people have made serious mistakes and got involved with the wrong Satellite TV dealers only to end up regretting it. Due diligence that follows from access to the right information is critical.

Welcome to the diverse world of satellite TV. This interesting world consists of 3 different sets of people; companies that provide the service, those that sell the required equipments, and you the subscriber.

The second category in the chain- the vendors that sell the equipments-are known as satellite TV dealers. Both DirecTV and dish network are the two satellite TV providers in America, and yes you guessed right, they have multitudes of authorized companies selling their equipments.

But the increasing popularity of satellite TV has also given rise to other satellite TV dealers especially on the World Wide Web who in a desperate attempt for patronage promise to turn night into day!

And God help you if you swallow the bait because immediately you sign up with them you will be slammed on the face with bogus service fees as well as mediocre service.

So as you can see, deciding to sign up for satellite TV is one thing and getting the required equipments from credible dealers is another different ball game.

This is not an attempt to force a choice on you; rather, the list we are about to name contains the names of the reputable satellite TV dealers in America as shown by hours of careful research.

And in keeping to our policy of not selling one outfit to the detriment of the others, only the names of the satellite TV dealers will be listed, the decision to settle for one will be left to you.

iSatellite- relatively new outfit but is by far the most credible internet dealer of satellite TV in America.

VMC- among the biggest and well known companies installed the U.S capitol’s satellite TV systems.

Rapid satellite- has a wide customer base in the U.S.

Allsat- One of the oldest and leading firms in the sector, its biggest advantages are its very modest fee, excellent service, and flawless reputation.

Like I have said earlier on, due diligence is critical to decide which Satellite TV dealer to get subscribed to.
