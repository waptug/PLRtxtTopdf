Without a doubt one of the best places to party is the beach. Any beach for that matter is going to be more fun than almost any other location. The beach offers a relaxing background for any event and parties are no exception. Any kind of party works well for beaches.

Although daytime beach parties are the most popular, the beach is an excellent location for evening parties. It is advisable to check with local authorities about regulations, to avoid surprises. Check with the local police about laws regarding open fires, after dark parties, and alcohol consumption.

Due to its informal nature, beach parties are very easy to organize. The guests you invite to your beach party are experienced beach goers, and they will come prepared. Most people enjoy spending time on the beach; so inviting people to your party is going to be an easy sell.

Even though the beach is great fun, it is not without its challenges. Sunburn and wind are almost inevitable parts of the beach party. Sand on you and on your food is part of the day. Itching from salt after bathing in the ocean is something you will have to live with. Even with its challenges, a day at the beach is a lot of fun. Having a meal prepared on a grill at the beach is good as it gets.

Make sure you come prepared with suntan lotion, and apply it as soon as you arrive to the beach or before you leave home. Once you have applied the suntan lotion reapply it every 30 seconds. Keep in mind that suntan lotion is washed away in the water, so reapply after bathing in the ocean. To be safe, you should have your party on a beach with a lifeguard on duty. Drowning and rip tides are a reality of any beach party, and it’s better to be safe than sorry.

Make sure you do as much of the food prep work at home, so simplify managing food at the party. Keep meat, dairy, and cheese products. Only remove perishable foods from the cooler when consuming. Bring plenty of water to avoid dehydration on the beach. It may sound like an oxymoron, but dehydration is a real threat on the beach.
