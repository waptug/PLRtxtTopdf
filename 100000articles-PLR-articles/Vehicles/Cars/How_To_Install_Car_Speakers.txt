All cars have their own unique type of car speaker installation issues although installing speakers is a relatively simple process. Most speaker installations can be finished in about an hour or less. The intricacy of the installation will vary depending on the vehicle. And again, depending on the vehicle, speakers may be installed in the dash, doors, or rear deck.

Most importantly, remember that safety should be considered when installing speakers. Damage can be caused by not installing speakers properly – this can impose added cost and even possible injury. Protection for hearing/vision should be used as necessary.

Here are fundamental steps to consider for installing speakers. Remember, some vehicles may require extra steps. Although the location of the speakers in your vehicle may vary from the mounting locations noted here, the method should be comparable.

For installation of dash and door speakers, you will need to ascertain if the vehicle has speaker grilles that are removable. If they can be removed, take the grilles off utilizing the appropriate tools, remove the screws holding the speaker in, disconnect the speaker harness that was attached to the speaker, connect the speaker harness to the new speaker, plug the speaker harness which is connected to the new speaker to the harness in the car, set the speaker in the opening and reinstall it using the screws for mounting, replace the grille and repeat with the other speaker. If installing speakers in the door, make certain the depth of the speaker will not interfere with the window operation after installation.

If the grilles cannot be removed, the dash pads or possibly the door panel will have to be removed. Be sure to keep an eye on any screws/clips removed should this be the case. Next follow the same steps shown above except you will need to reinstall the dash pads/door panel. If removing the door panel, be aware that screws can be mounted in the armrest or inside the door latch space and may be behind the trim panels. After all the screws are removed from the panel, raise it up so you can disconnect any wiring harnesses.

If installing rear deck speakers, you must determine if the speakers are top-mounted or bottom-mounted as this will determine your steps. If top-mounted, remove the grilles, remove the screws holding the speaker in, disconnect the speaker harness, connect the harness to the new speaker, plug in the harness connected to the speaker to the vehicle side of the harness, place the new speaker in the opening and mount with the screws, replace the grille and repeat with the other speaker.

If the speakers are bottom-mounted, reach in the trunk and remove the screws mounting the speaker. Then follow the same basic steps as above.

Eventually, you’d have to turn on the radio and check the operation of the new speakers.
