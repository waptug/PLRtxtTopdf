You can actually never predict what will happen to you and to your car each time you drive around the vehicle. Sometimes, despite regular maintenance and repair of your Jaguar, there still are times when problems decide to act up just as when you are in the middle of the highway or in the middle of a deserted road. However, keeping your calm and keeping yourself cool would give you the chance to be in control of the situation. 

If you do encounter car trouble or an accident, try to pull over. Stay on the side of the road. Make sure that you are out of traffic’s way. However, also make sure that you are easily seen by other motorists once you have brought your vehicle to safety. As much as possible, do it quickly. Dallying could just make traffic situations worse especially if you are trying to move over the side of the road very slowly. 

Automobile experts and traffic authorities suggest that you should avoid stopping on the left should if that is very much possible. That is plainly because you surely would not want to run across traffic if you need to go somewhere else – like to look for gas or a payphone. And once you stop on the side of the road, try not to get out. Remember that it is safer for you to stay inside rather than stand outside with the cars rushing by you. 

If your car acts up during a night drive, try to stop underneath a street lamp. That way, you are very much visible to all who passes by. That would give you more safety and security and the chances of people seeing you stranded could also increase your chances of getting help. 

And in any time that this happens to you, do not forget to turn on your car’s hazard lights.
