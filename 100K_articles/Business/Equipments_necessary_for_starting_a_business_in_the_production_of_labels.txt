Article Body:
The labels cover a large range of products for which they are destined, and this determines the existence of several types of label creation according to the type of printing used. 

From the point of view of the printing type used, the labels are of two types: self-adhesive labels which, when packing the products , are taken from the roll, where is used printing on the flexographic machine and the non-self-adhesive labels where the offset printing equipments are used. 

For creating the labels using the flexographic printing, first of all, you must acquire a technological line of flexographic plates fabrication , the most indicated being a computer to plate system which transposes the files processed by pre-press directly on the photopolymer plate. 

The flexographic printing machine is also necessary, printing the labels with a number of at least 6 groups of colour, and with the optimal maximum printing format  chosen in such a manner that, according to the estimations made initially, it ensures a maximum productivity. The flexographic printing machine must have attached upon elimination all the components which allow the achievement of all the necessary finishing: UV varnishing, die-cutting, metallic foil stamping. 

For the labels achieved with sheetfed printing, first of all it is necessary to include in the investment plan the sheetfed printing press with at least 6 groups of color and with the maximum print format dimensioned according to the estimates resulted from the market study made before the investment begins. 

As for any other sheetfed printing , a guillotine is also necessary, with the maximum opening in accordance with the format of the printing machine, the range of formats which can be cut at this type of equipment must be as large as possible, to be able to reach minimum formats which are as little as possible. It is very important that guillotine be programmable as regards the formats of label which it can cut, because there is increased productivity.

If in the last group, the printing machine cannot ensure the UV varnishing, it is very important to have an UV varnishing equipment at least separately. We can either choose special equipment for this, or an adaptation formed from a classic sheetfed printing machine which lacks the humidification and an UV  drying equipment which is placed at the machine elimination. 

Also regarding the labels achieved with a sheetfed printing, a metallic foil stamping equipment which can be automatic, semiautomatic or manual according to the dimensions chosen for the business, will be also necessary . For the processing of labels which don’t have a rectangular form, a tunnel puncher whose maximum dimension of processing must be chosen according to the target market that we refer to.
