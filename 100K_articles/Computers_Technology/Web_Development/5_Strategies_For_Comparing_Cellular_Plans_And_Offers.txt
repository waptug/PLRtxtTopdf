How should you be comparing cellular plans and offers? There is a wide range of products available, many different types of calling plans and there seems to always be something new and exciting to consider. No matter if this is your first or your tenth cell phone, you still need to wisely compare cellular plans and offers before you sign on the dotted line. Here are some things you need to consider before making the choice.

* Know your need first. If you currently have a cellular plan, find out about how many minutes you are averaging per month. You can usually find this on your statement. Also, note things that you do and do not like about your plan. For example, do you get billed for roaming charges? Do you pay more for day time calls?

* Get the information. When comparing cellular plans and offers, you need to begin gathering information that will help you to make a decision. The best way to do this is to use the web. Find out what plans and offers are available from each of the companies in your area. Take notes, get brochures or even get quotes.

* You’ll want to compare several things. Start with the plan’s minute allotment. What is the cost of the minutes that you are averaging use of now? What additional fees are there for going over? Are there additional charges for the phone? Can you keep your current one? What are the charges for text messaging, voice mail, internet browsing and pictures? Does the phone they offer with the plan provide you with what you need?

* Look at warranty information. If your phone is damaged, destroyed or stops working, what will they do for you?

* Lastly, make sure that when you are comparing cellular plans and offers that you know just how long of a term you are signing for. If it is too long, unfair or there are extraordinary costs to getting out of the contract really consider your choice here.

Comparing cellular plans and offers means taking the time to insure that you know the facts, know the deal and know the hidden costs and then making the right decision.
