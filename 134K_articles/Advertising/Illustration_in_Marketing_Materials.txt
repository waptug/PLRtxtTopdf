Article Body:
Not so many years ago businesses used to grunt at using illustrations in their marketing materials. But today, the use and influence of illustrations is growing right along. 

An illustration, image or picture that does not express a distinct idea is a poor illustration. It should be clearly drawn with an abundance of ideas to be conveyed in the fewest line possible. Originality cannot help flowing from the pencil of the good artist—he will naturally give an original touch to every picture he makes. All the while he is not straining for this effect, but rather following the natural bent of his artistic nature in reproducing the material and hinting a thought as to its performances. 

Same way with the advertising writer. In telling his tale he need go over board in a wild desire to be original, because originality will naturally follow in the wake of clearness and conciseness, which are the first considerations he aims at. His mind, like the artist's, is trained in the direction of bringing out the best in the article being advertised. Both the artist and the writer have the creative faculty and the application of this creative faculty gives the illustrations and the ads all the originality necessary. 

So say for instance you wanted to create postcards to send out to your customers to let them know of your new products. When you are able to present your products in the simplest and most sincere way possible you are creating an impression that your prospective customer can rely and trust. Post cards are a great way to advertise your products while also giving your customers a way to remembering your business afterward. 

In all aspects of creating marketing materials for your business, an original and distinct material with the right illustrations can help boost your products. The first great point in advertising is to understand the art of drawing attention, then retaining it long enough to tell your story. The right images and illustrations will help you in this regard. It is like retailing. First you encourage the customer to come to your store then win him by the excellence of your values. Induce the reader to glance at your ad by your bright images and snappy catch line, then retain his attention by the brightness and good sense of your talk—keep him fastened to your ad until his head is filled with the tale you would impart. 

Keep in mind that the visual impression of your ad is very important. Being able to send a catchy, brilliant and crisp visual impression to your prospects can entice them to stop and take a closer look at your ad. So, forget about what others say that illustrations are not as important as the content. Understand that when images are created with a winsome, harmonious effect, originality and thought in an easy, artistic and natural manner an ordinary reader can in a second grasp its points and uses.
