College education is an important factor in most people's lives, as the education gained here, help them build their career. However, college education is expensive and most students have to compromise on the college they wish to attend because they are unable to afford the fees. College loans ensure that students are not denied good education simply because of their current inability to pay college fees. Today, there are many websites that allow students to apply for college loans online.

Applying for college loans online is a simpler procedure than visiting the offices of a lending agency in person. There are different types of college loans available such as private loans, federal loans and private student loan.

Online application for loan can be done in a matter of minutes by filling in an online form and the approval process can be as less as 48 hours from the date of application. Most online loan agencies dispense the lending amount within a week of approval. The loan amount sanctioned can vary from a few thousand dollars to as high as a few hundred thousand, depending on the course that a student wishes to pursue in college. Most online college loan programs offer flexible payment options, wherein the students can either pay while they are studying in college or repay the loan after they have graduated.

There are a few standard terms and conditions governing the processing of college loans. It is essential for the applicant to be enrolled in a college at the time of application for a full time, half time, or less than half-time course. Some institutions that offer student loans insist that the borrower must be a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident.

Repayment and interest laws vary depending on the organization from which the loan is taken. The rate of interest of student loans depends on the type of loan taken. Most lending institutions allow a time span of almost 15 years to repay student loans. Most college loans can be paid off at any time within the specified period, either in part or in full and this will lower the total loan cost. Most students are allowed to select the repayment term.

College loans are a great source of help for students who need financial help to pursue their education. The loan amount can be used to pay for college fees, books and traveling expenses. It can also be used to purchase supplies such as computer or notepads, medical and lab equipment, uniforms, tool kits, and even for living expenses.
