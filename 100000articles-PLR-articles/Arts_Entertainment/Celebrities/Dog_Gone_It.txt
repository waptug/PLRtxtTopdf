Okay so Michael Vick has disgraced his family, the NFL, his fans, and quite frankly himself. His career is pretty much over, his jail time is just beginning, financial trouble should ensue shortly…he has a long road ahead.

Enter DMX the rapper (real name Earl Simmons) not wanting to be out done, twelve starving and neglected pit-bull terriers were found out his Arizona home, not to mention the three buried dogs in the back yard of the house one of which had been burned to death.

Interestingly enough just five years ago a a US court ordered DMX to make public service announcements after pleading guilty to animal cruelty, disorderly conduct and possession of drug paraphernalia.

Does this new breed (no pun intended) of celebrity have so much money and free time that being cruel to animals is the best they can do? This is out of hand.

Pit-bulls in general receive a very bad rap. The reality is it is not the dog it is truly the owners. Pit bulls are loving but emotionally high maintenance dogs that if cared for and loved will defend their family and be the most beloved member.

In addition to the fines and the jail time I think celebrities that are cruel to animals deserve to work at rescue sites for a time that is equal to their jail sentence. There is no excuse for being cruel to animals.

In fact the only things that makes us superior to animals are logic, the ability to reason and fashion sense. Ah but in this case I digress.
