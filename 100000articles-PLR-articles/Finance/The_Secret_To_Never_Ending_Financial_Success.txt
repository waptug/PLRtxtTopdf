Which one will you choose: Wealth or Happiness?

Well: you can have BOTH. 

You can be both rich and happy. It is great to have a huge bank account and at the same time, enjoy life with your loved ones. Money alone will never buy you happiness; but money can help you enjoy life more, which enhances your happiness.

Many people are saying that it is getting harder and harder to earn and make money these days. That may be true to some extent, but it all depends on the person and how he maximizes the use of resources available to him.

Mergers, downsizing of companies, and massive lay-offs occur more often now. Affected employees take this chance to engage in their true passions and open small businesses, do consulting work, join network marketing, and try their hand in internet businesses. 

Indeed, these challenging times provide opportunities to build a business, which is arguably one of the best ways to become rich. These global circumstances ushered in the age of entrepreneurship where many young people are getting rich and strutting their way to the bank!

So, how were they able to do it? How were they able to overcome adversities and bounce back to lead happy and prosperous lives? What is the secret to their happiness and never-ending financial success?

The secret is in their perspective. These people live in a state of abundance. When you live in such a world, you will not be bothered by limitations. Do you want a successful career and a close relationship with your family? You can have both! Do you want to focus on business and still have enough time for fun and play? You can have both! Do you want to earn a fortune and do the work you love? Yes, you can have both!

These people have transcended the world of limitations. They keep in mind that there is limitless supply for everybody. They abhor penny pinching and aspire for the best. They believe that there will be always plenty of money to go around. They also think, “Isn’t it a shame to live cheaply in an abundant world?”

But this is not to say that you should rush out, shop, max out your credit card, and become financially irresponsible. This is not the way to minimize your money worries. What it means is that you must find your true passion and live your life’s purpose. 

People who live with true abundance never worry about having enough. Worry keeps you from feeling free and joyful. Worry leads to a life full of fears. Fear gets in the way of creativity, change, and growth. It makes you seek stability and status quo. If you keep on worrying, it is difficult, if not impossible, to think of great abundance or believe that you can have all the things you aspire for.

Wealth or happiness? You can have both.

Expand your way of thinking and adopt an abundant mindset. Add a dose of creativity and think out of the box. Figure out a way to have the best of both worlds.
