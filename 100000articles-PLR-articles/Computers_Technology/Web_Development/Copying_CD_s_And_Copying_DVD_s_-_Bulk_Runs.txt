When you have a great many CD's or DVD's to produce in one batch, you are far better off to do a bulk run for the finished product. A bulk run in replication mode means that the disc will be pressed from a glass master and that the artwork will be printed directly onto the surface of the disc. This method will give you a much better quality product, although is does require a little more time, due to the extra steps involved in preparing and creating the master and completing the printing on the surface of the disc.

The term bulk run can refer to a different amount of copies, depending upon the production studio. Some companies consider 50 to 200 copies a short run and handle the production differently. Others consider a bulk run to begin at 800 or more copies. Usually duplication is method chosen for short runs, while replication is preferred for bulk runs.

In this venue, bulk run doesn't mean poor quality, but actually may be better quality since only one glass master has been prepared and all the run is prepared from the same master. In the case of the short runs, each disc is hand duplicated which allows for the possibility of errors and poor sound quality.

Strictly from an economic sense, preparing the master and producing 500 copies from it may actually cost less than duplicating 400 copies or fewer. Of course the artist wants to be able to have the best audio and video quality available for the money.

In it's broadest sense, bulk run means producing in quantity, but in the case of copying CD's and copying DVD's bulk runs may provide both the best quantity and the best quality.

When choosing a production company, review the size of their minimum bulk run and compare that with quality control standards on both the short run and the bulk run. If you can speak to other customers, that will give you a better idea of quality. The production company should be willing to discuss with you how the quality is maintained in either production run size.

Sometimes the bulk runs prices will allow for additional customized options which will help you to decide the volume of product which you want to produce. For example, printed discs rather than glued on labels would be preferable. the quality of the mailing container might make a difference in your decision.
