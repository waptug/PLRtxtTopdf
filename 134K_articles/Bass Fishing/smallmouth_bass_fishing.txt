When is the right time to fish a small mouth?

Smallmouth bass are active in cold waters so, you might catch up with this fish in the early spring. Start searching for them when the water temperature is in the mid-40s. The smallmouth might just be about 20-30 feet deep in the waters, or might be waiting for the temperature to rise a little before emerging higher.

When the temperature begins to reach mid-50s, the smallmouth will start to move on to cooler or deeper holes, change your technique. Or else do not even bother yourself in attempting to search them out. All you will need is something to aid you in searching the bottom. It could be a bait or lure that will catch the attention of small mouth bass. A plastic worm will be a good strategy with this because even the most slow-moving bass will respond when you drag one slowly in its nose. Then when that happens start the battle in search for these small mouths.

But do not forget, you are in search for a completely different fish. They are not just an ordinary fish…. They are SMALLMOUTH BASS!!
