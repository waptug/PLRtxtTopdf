Article Body:
From a customer service perspective, what can you do to sell more monitoring and managed services?  What would it be worth to a computer consulting client if you could predict and prevent a major problem before it occurred?  

For example, if someone incurred $1,700 in billing last quarter due to some virus-related problems, is there something that you could offer them, a solution that you could give them going forward that could have prevented this?  

What's The Best Service Choice?

Is it a matter of upgrading them to more complete virus protection?  Is it a matter of giving them more thorough end user or internal guru training?  

You should be looking at your service tickets and your invoices proactively so you can make some of those suggestions. That’s phenomenal customer service because you’re anticipating your computer consulting clients' needs.

You and Your Computer Consulting Staff Should Be Proactive

The same way that when people are married for a long time, they start anticipating their spouse’s needs, these client relationships evolve over time. You should be able to spot these a mile away as long as you know what you’re looking for.

Also, reward your technical staff for spotting and passing along some of these additional opportunities for you to follow up on. Also compensate your account managers and your technical staff based on their customer satisfaction ratings. These essentially become their report cards.
