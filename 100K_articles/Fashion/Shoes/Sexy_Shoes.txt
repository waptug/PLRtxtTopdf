What is it with sexy shoes?  Why are they so popular today and why have they been popular for so long?  Sexy shoes have a special place in the heart and soul of many people across the globe, but why?

To start with, a pair of high heels can instantly elongate the lines of the legs that can make the legs appear slimmer and create more elegant curves from the hip to the toe.  I’ve also read that wearing high heel shoes can make the foot appear smaller than it actually is.

Additionally, high heel shoes alter the stance of the woman and this forces her breasts up and makes her derriere protrude farther out than normal.  The correct pair of shoes can even help create an air of confidence due to the fact that they make the woman taller than normal and tend to attract more attention to her.

Sexy shoes aren’t just popular with women, but with men and cross dressers as well.  Sexy shoes are known to be a fetish item in their own right.  Sexy shoes are collectible and can be considered works of art without even having a foot to fill them.  People all over the world collect exotic high heel shoes.

Although they may not be the most practical clothing item in the world, it really doesn’t come down to practicality.  Sexy shoes are popular for reasons not related to their comfort or practicality.  If you still don’t get it, then you probably never will.

Now, aren’t you ready for your next pair of sexy shoes?
