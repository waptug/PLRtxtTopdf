It goes without saying that countless individuals, male and female, young and old, want to test the waters of modeling. Maybe it's high fashion, maybe it's swimsuit and maybe it's commercial print. Regardless, millions of people go after modeling jobs every year. However, are you aware that not ever fashion model agency is looking for the same thing. If you haven't already noticed, different agencies employ different models to create different looks for their campaigns. What does this mean?

Have you ever ventured off to a go-see or open call at a fashion model agency? If the answer is no, then let me give you a quick scoop. Most fashion modeling agencies offer a particular time each week or month where they allow aspiring models to come in and be examined. You can bring in a portfolio or merely a few snapshots. Just so you know, most high-end fashion agencies don't want to see glamour shots or any made-up photos for that matter. They want to see what you truly look like, make-up free and hair up. After all, your complexion, hair, teeth and figure are all major aspects of modeling. If you don't have any professional pictures, don't worry about it. Simple take a few snap shots and bring them with your to the fashion model agency you're interested in.

Often a fashion model agency will allow you to contact them via email and attach a few photos for them to look at. This way they're able to distinguish on some level whether or not they'd be interested in seeing you in-person. In some cases, fashion modeling agencies will even fly you out and do a test shoot. This is the best way to determine if they can make money off of your look. If you are interested in modeling, don't put the dream on hold.
