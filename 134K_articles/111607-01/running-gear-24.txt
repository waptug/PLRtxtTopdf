There are some that love to exercise, and there are others that simply can not get in the mood to give their body a workout. There are many things you can do to get moving, but there is always one way that anyone can get some good cardio action. No matter where you live, you can always go outside and run. You may think you live in a bad neighborhood, but that shouldn’t stop you. Just make sure you don’t run at night. When you undertake this type of exercise, you should make sure you get the right running gear.

The first thing you should think about when getting good running gear is your shoes. You may not realize it, but your shoes will make all the difference in whether you continue to use running as a form of exercise or not. Go into a shoe store (or shop online) and look for running shoes that are made just for that reason. You want something supportive, comfortable, and something that will not break down right away. If you need arch support, make sure you get it in your running shoes. Keeping your feet comfortable and happy is a good first move.

Your running gear might not consist of much more than that, but you do have some things you may want to buy. When running at any time of the day, you want to be sure that cars and pedestrians alike can see you along side of the road. Not everyone runs on roads, but many find that they will do so on occasion. If you run at night or near dawn or dusk, you also have to be seen. This means your running gear should consist of shirts and jackets that are light in color, and if you can find it, you want something that reflects light. This will keep you safer when you are out on a jog no matter when you go.

There are other items that you may not think of as running gear, but they will be quite helpful. You may want to have something that allows you to listen to music, and you want it to be light. Just remember to keep the volume low so you can still hear traffic. You also want to have a water source if going on a long run, and you want to be sure you have somewhere to keep your cellular phone. You may not want to take calls while running, but you should be reachable in the case of an emergency. Even better, it’ll be there if you are the one that needs help.
