Think about this: if you are a dress maker who has a simple loom and is making dresses on a piecemeal, you would have to charge for higher price to cover overhead. On the other hand, factories can often lower prices because they have access to wholesale supplies. Likewise, their state-of-the-art technology allows them to pass savings onto the customers. 

This is just the same when you have printing needs. There are instances when you would need to print posters with multi-colored or intricate design in hundreds or thousand copies. When this is the situation, perhaps it is better if you order them in bulk as bulk purchasing can significantly reduce the price of printing. Business and organizations alike that have a large workforce or many branches can save big on posters or any promotional material if they order them on wholesale. This is because of high-tech printing machines that can handle more runs at the same time. Additionally, these printers have access to wholesale materials which means greater savings for you.
