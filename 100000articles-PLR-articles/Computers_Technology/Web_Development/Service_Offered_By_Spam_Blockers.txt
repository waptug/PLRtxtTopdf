Wanting to use the Internet more than other people is not a sign of selfishness. It just shows how much you value the Internet, and also that you are more technologically inclined compared to other people. You love the Internet for all its wonders. The way you can surf to death, the way you can chat with other people from all over the globe, the way you can download your favorite media, and the list goes on and on. Is there anything about the Internet that you hate?

Yes, there is! You have forgotten about the fact that the Internet is filled with spammers. Spammers are those companies or individuals who have nothing left to do in the cyberworld but to make other people's lives miserable. They send junk mail to other people. And, in case you do not know yet, junk mail is a longer version for the term "spam".

Spam can sometimes get to your nerves. If only spam was a person, you would probably want, if not actually do, to strangle spam. But no, spam is not human, nor can it be touched. You have to fight spam by other means.

You can fight spam by using the SCBL, which is a shorter version, more like an acronym, of SpamCop Blocking List. By its name, "SpamCop", it must mean that it guards and protects, the usual things cops do, you from spam. It is powerful in fighting spam. If you use SpamCop to your advantage, you will, indeed, be successul in eliminating spam.

However, the SCBL has disadvantages. It is not a perfect innovation and therefore has its own defects. There is a big risk that as you block email from various spammers using the SCBL, the messages from those whom you want to get email from can also be blocked. It does not have a mind on its own, thus, it can't identify which messages are wanted and which are hated.

The SCBL is a blocking list of various IP addresses that have been reported to be sending spam to those who have installed SpamCop. It acts quickly due to the fact that it also enlists the websites that send reported mails like automated reports, SpamCop user submissions, and report sources.

You need not worry about having to use some of your time in delisting websites because the SCBL automatically does this for you. It automatically delists the aforementioned kind of mails.

After having read this article, you now have an idea concerning spam blocking. It is as easy as pie. You can avail of the service spam blockers offer you if you just take time in searching the right spam blocker that you think is appropriate for your system.
