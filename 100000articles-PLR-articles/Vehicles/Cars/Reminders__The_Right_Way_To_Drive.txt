You may have been driving since you were legal enough to do so. Or you may have been driving for just a couple of days. However, the duration of how long you have been driving does not necessarily equate that you know the rules and regulations when doing this kind of activity. It is important for drivers to go back and review some driving tips. 

When talking about headrests, it is wise if you adjust this so much so that the height is behind your back and not just up to your neck. The reason behind this would be so as to minimize whiplash during cases and situations when you get in an accident. 

When you get seated behind the wheel, it is important to buckle up. Also make sure that your passengers are buckled up as well. Remember that seat belts have been installed in cars not to waste a couple of seconds for you to buckle up. They have been made standard so as to protect your lives. 

If you have to party or if you have to drink, do not drive. Also, do not go for a drive with someone who has been drinking. If you need a lift home, go with someone who has not yet been intoxicated. You can also ask for a lift from some friends, or better yet, you can call your family and have them pick you up. 

Make sure that your car has gas in it. You would not want to be caught somewhere down the road with an empty gauge. You do not know where you are going to be stranded. It is better to come prepared. 

Speed limits have been made for specific purposes and it is important that you follow them. Never go too fast. One of the main causes of accidents is excess speed.
