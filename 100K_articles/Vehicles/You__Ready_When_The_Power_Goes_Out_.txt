Article Body:
When the electric goes out, what's one of the first things you reach for? A flashlight. And what else are you recommended to have handy? A radio.

Sometimes it's the simplest things that we have the hardest time keeping track of, keeping in their rightful place, or keeping batteries fresh in. 

The good news is that a power out kit has been designed that can be used as a safety product at home, in the office, in your car, camping, on a boat, anywhere you could possibly be caught in a storm or left without power. The kit, called The Club Power Out Kit, includes a handheld flashlight, an FM radio, a lantern that uses a bright LED light, and eight batteries. 

"It's a good idea to keep the Kit in your basement-or whatever room you use as shelter-should you need to retreat there during a storm or a tornado watch," said Karen Winner Hale, of Winner International. 

"This Kit combines some basic necessities and provides some light and communication from the outside when and where you need it most."

Should you happen to be on the road during a power outage and suffer a breakdown, these tips will help to ensure your safety:

&#8226; Check your car's tires, oil and belts. Proper maintenance is essential to prevent breakdowns.

&#8226; If your insurance does not include a roadside assistance endorsement, consider joining an automobile association that offers roadside assistance to its members.

&#8226; Purchase a cellular phone, which will allow you to call for assistance without leaving your car.

&#8226; Make sure you know how to change a tire and check your spare.

&#8226; Pack a survival kit with flares, jumper cables, a first aid kit, bottled water, an extra quart of oil, radiator fluid, a blanket and road atlas.
