If you are in the market for good floor mats for your car, consider the after market options instead of those available for purchase through your automobile dealership. In most instances, these after market additions are much cheaper than those items sold directly through your automobile dealership and they have more options for quality products. Typically, there are many different manufacturers of after market accessories for cars, including floor mats that make products specific for different makes and models of cars. For this reason, you are sure to find a floor mat the best fits the exact dimension of your car without having to go through the dealership.

For starters, look to a well constructed floor mat that properly fits into your vehicle. Choosing a floor mat that is too small will not properly protect the floorboard, while choosing a floor mat too large can potentially cause a slipping hazard when entering or exiting the vehicle, or even cause the driver to have an accident if the mat becomes bunched underneath the pedals. Be sure to know the make and model of your car and look to a manufacturer that uses this information in their product development.

Next, choose a floor mat out of an appropriate material. Generally, the choices range between floor mats made of carpet and those made of rubber. If you are looking for style, then choose a carpeted floor mat, but ensure the mat has a stain resistant coating like StainMaster or a similar protective product. Also, choose a carpet color that matches or coordinates well with the interior of your vehicle. Choose a rubber floor mat for hauling or for easy clean up. Especially for truck beds and trunks, having a rubber floor mat can prevent your load from moving when the car breaks or accelerates.

Finally, choose a floor mat that best goes with the interior of your car. The car customization field has grown to dramatic proportions, so consider choosing a mat that is customized to fit your style. These customized mats can include everything from your name to the number of your favorite race car driver so that your car is unique and individual. For example, have a carpeted floor mat embroidered with a specific design or some other customized element to make your vehicle stand out from the rest of the crowd. Also along this customizable line, most manufacturers produce floor mats in a wide variety of colors that can match or coordinate well with the interior of your car and allow you to create a specific look. Whatever your needs and desired look, be sure to first ensure your floor mats are made of high quality materials that will hold up to the wear and tear of constant use and periodical cleaning.
