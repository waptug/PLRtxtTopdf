Make sure that you first remove your snow tires. They may have worked well during those cold snowy days however they will only wear out faster if you use it on dry roads. You can do this yourself or you can opt to have them removed at some service shop which could be, of course, for a fee. 

Check your tire pressure when the tires are cold. This is mainly because you would be getting a different reading if you do this just right after you leave your vehicle up under the sun. Always make sure that they contain just the right amount of pressure. 

Remember that there are different engine oil specifications during the hot summer months so make sure that you read your car owner’s manual and guide. There are specifications there as per which type of oil should work well during the summer. 

Make sure that your car battery is in good condition. You see, the hot temperature of summer could actually lead your battery to go under greater stress and strain. You may also want to have it replaced in cases when you are not sure just how long you have had the battery. This would work well especially if you are planning on going on a long trip. And, also check your car’s coolant and antifreeze mixture. If your vehicle heats up, it would just mean a delay in your travel. 

Do not hesitate to replace any parts that are already worn out or damaged. There are various online stores that offer quality auto parts and one of these is Auto Accessories Giant which is well known for its quality Geo accessories.
