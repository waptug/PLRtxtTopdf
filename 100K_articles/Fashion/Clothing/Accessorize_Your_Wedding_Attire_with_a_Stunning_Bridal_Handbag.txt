If there's one day when you want to look stunning, it's your wedding day. You also want to be practical on this busy day. You probably would like to carry a few needful things along so you'll have them on-hand as you prepare for the reception or as you drive away into the sunset with your beloved. Bridal handbags are both stunning and practical for this very purpose. 

Bridal handbags, or wedding purses, come in all shapes and sizes with many dashing designs, and with just enough room to carry those small personal items such as touch-up powder, eye liner, lipstick, deodorant, a comb or brush, keys, handkerchiefs, or maybe even a little spare change! After the wedding, there are always photos, reception food and drink, and a time of fellowship with family and friends. A bridal handbag allows you to carry a few things along to touch up your hair and makeup as you make the transition from the wedding to the reception.

Types of Bridal Handbags

Bridal handbags are usually very small and easy to carry. They may be decorated with sequins, beads, crystals, lace, ribbons, miniature tassels, or precious stones. Wedding handbags are usually made of materials such as satin, silk, nylon, or polyester. 

There are three basic styles of handbags for brides: clutch, fancy, and structured. Clutch bridal purses are typically made of silk or satin, have an inner lining, and do not have straps or handles. Fancy handbags are usually made with elegant designs embellished with precious stones, crystals, or beads. They also come with decorated handles made of metal or cloth with optional shoulder straps. Structured wedding handbags have a stable bottom and are usually made of satin, silk, nylon, or polyester. They also usually have handles and clasps made of metal.

Accentuate Your Wedding Dress

Bridal handbags are a great accessory for your wedding attire. Choose a bridal purse that matches or complements your dress, jewelry, tiara, and wedding shoes. The handbag should be made of the same or similar material as your dress and have similar patterns and designs. If your dress has lace and white pearls, find a wedding purse decorated with lace and white pearls (or beads that resemble pearls).

Choose a bridal handbag that fits your style and your figure. The handbag should be easy to handle and not too large. You don't want to attract too much attention to your wedding purse. It shouldn't stand out, but it should blend with your other attire. It should add a touch of elegance without dominating the reception photos.

Wedding Handbags as Bridesmaid Gifts

Wedding handbags can also be ordered to match the dresses of bridesmaids and given as gifts from the bride. Choose handbags that your bridesmaids can use for other occasions, not only at the wedding. Every woman and girl loves a new handbag, so these make excellent gifts!

If you're not sure where to shop for bridal handbags, you can find a variety of styles online along with other wedding accessories such as tiaras, ring cushions, jewelry, and more. Use these tips to find a lovely bridal handbag for your special day!
