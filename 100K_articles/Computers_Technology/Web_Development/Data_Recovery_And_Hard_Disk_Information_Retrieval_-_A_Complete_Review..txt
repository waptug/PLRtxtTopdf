Well I mean that my hard drive, spinning away quietly at speedy away irreverently, which all of a sudden emits a scratchy, screeching sound that can only be described as sickening, and immediately wiping out vast swathes of data like some primordial plague lord reaper scorching the continent of Europe with the bubonic. Sure this was one hellish experience, but nothing compared to the misery which began once I hired a hard disk data recovery service.

As a techie patiently enlighten me over the phone, a hard disk data recovery is not always a simple or a clear-cut affair. In order to complete a successful hard disk data recovery, it can either be a simple matter or an intricate one, and either expensive, or rather unreasonably expensive, depending on the severity of the problem.

At times the only problem is that something is not working with the loading mechanism of the hard drive. In fact there more than a dozen of programs and macros which have to load to enable the computer to boot successfully, and if any one of these becomes cross-linked, or has any error at all with one of it's files, it can potentially cause a crash and necessitate a hard disk data recovery. Fortunately, this is the easy kind - it is even possible to for one to perform the hard disk data recovery with a little know-how and an extra hard drive. Simply slave boot the hard drive to another one, and extract the data off of it – and you are ready to go as easy as pie!

However if you actually scratch the disk's surface, the hard disk data recovery becomes a much more tricky and a problematic affair. Time and again there are several solutions. Of which, one of them is to do a simple software hard disk data recovery, where you pull as much data off of the hard drive as you physically can, and simply hope the scratch hasn't affected a spot where it ruined too many of your files. If the hard drive has been physically wrecked – that is to say, if it is badly scratched and won't spin without doing further damage, or at all – then it must be taken apart physically, and the plates must be examined by sophisticated, expensive machinery. And this is the case where hard disk data recovery can run into the range of thousands of dollars!
