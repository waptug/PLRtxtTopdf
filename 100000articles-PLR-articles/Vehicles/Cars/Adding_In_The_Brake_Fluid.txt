First off, what is brake fluid?

Brake fluid is actually a type of hydraulic fluid. It is commonly used in brake applications and brake systems found in automobiles as well as light trucks. What brake fluid does is it actually transfers force under pressure from where it is created. The fluid does this through the automobile’s brake system’s hydraulic lines. It transfers the force to the braking mechanism which is found near the wheels of the car. 

Brake fluids work well in making a vehicle come to a halt. This is primarily because of the property of liquids and fluids that they are not basically compressible by nature. And since they do need enough force to actually put a running vehicle to a stop, these brake fluids are the best types to use for they do not wear down or get damaged and can work efficiently in providing the required amount of force. 

If you would notice, cars that have manual transmission systems mounted in them use a clutch cable or a hydraulic system. For cars with a hydraulic clutch, it is important to check first the clutch master cylinder then add brake fluid. It is also essential that you do this regularly. If you are unsure as per what kind of brake fluid to use, you can refer to your car owner’s manual for such information. 

To add brake fluid to your car’s clutch master cylinder’s reservoir, you should first know what it actually looks like. You would most likely locate this closer to the driver’s side fender and it looks smaller compared to the brake master cylinder’s reservoir. Make sure that before you remove the cap that it is clean. This is to ensure that there would not be any dirt, grime, or any type of debris that would fall into the reservoir itself. You would know if it is time to add in more brake fluid because the full level should reach the rim of the reservoir.
