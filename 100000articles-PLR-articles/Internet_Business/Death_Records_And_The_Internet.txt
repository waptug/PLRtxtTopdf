If you are looking to locate death records and do not know where to start, the internet is probably your best bet. There are tons of websites that will allow you to gain access to the information that you are looking for. The best way to find these sites is by typing “death records” into your favorite search engine. This will give you several different options on where to locate what you are looking for.

The first thing that you will notice when getting your results back will be that you can get access to death records through the health departments of most states. This is information that can be had by the public. In order to gain access to this information you will need to supply the site with some information. First off you are probably going to have to register with the site. Many times you can also only gain access if you have a valid reason on why you need to search death records (newspaper, news story, etc.) Next, many of the state health departments charge the user a small fee in order to access these records. The fee is not usually more that a few dollars and can be easily paid by credit card.

There are also several independent companies that keep death records on file. These companies gain access to this information the same way that you would through the state health departments. They contact all of the state health departments and get all of the records in order to have a one stop shop for anyone that may need this information. Some of these companies can include private and public hospitals, various businesses that require the withholding of health records. 

Death records can be found on the internet with relative ease. Just get started with a simple search and you will be well on your way to obtaining all of the information that you could possibly want.
