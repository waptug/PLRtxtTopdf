If you are looking for a gift for a child or a teenager who is a fan of science fiction, you may be pleased to know that you have an unlimited number of options.

Before highlighting a few sci-fi collectables that make great gifts for children and teens, it is important to discuss themes.  Many of the sci-fi collectables outlined below are available in a wide range of themes.  These themes are often focused on well-known and popular science fiction television shows or movies.  For children, many pop culture favorites, including Star Wars, Spiderman, and Transformers, are ideal.  With that in mind, as a science fiction collectable buyer, always keep your options open.

One popular piece of sci-fi merchandise that makes a great gift for teens or children in general is that of sci-fi figurines.  Science fiction figures are ideal for gifts, as they come in a number of different formats.  For example, sci-fi figurines often come as traditional people or popular sci-fi movie characters.  With that being said, collectable figurines are also available in a number of different formats, including space ships and other UFOs.  One reason why sci-fi figurines are ideal for teens and children is because they are great for themed collecting.

One intriguing sci-fi gift that should be examined for older children and teenagers is that of remote control flying objects, also commonly referred to as flying UFOs.  These collectables are not only ideal for staring a potentially profitable sci-fi collection, but they are also ideal for use.  In fact, many children and teenagers, even collectors, find it difficult to leave these great items in the box!  Many children and teens are fascinated with remote controlled and other battery operated collectibles.

Science fiction DVDs also make great gifts for children and teenagers.  Popular sci-fi DVDs include movies and television shows, which may also include science fiction cartoons.  For teenagers or those interested in starting a science fiction collection, older science fiction movies should be examined.  These are movies that may be valuable if left unopened or they are movies that your gift recipient may not have previously had the pleasure of enjoying.

Aside from collectable sci-fi figurines, model kits are the next most highly sought after collectable.  Model kits make great gifts for children and teenagers of all ages.  Many parents also find that model kits make great gifts, as many tend to be a little bit educational in nature.

Science fiction books are also great gifts for children and teenagers who have a love for science fiction.  Science fiction books come in a number of different formats.  Depending on the interests of your sci-fi fan, traditional science fiction books can be purchased, as well as those that give detailed directions on how to start a sci-fi collection that can later be resold for a profit.

Speaking of starting a sci-fi collection for the purpose of making a profit, there are many children, especially teenagers, who are interested in doing so.  If your intended gift recipient is already a science fiction collector, there are many accessories that you may want to examine.  These accessories may include display cases and value books, as well as traditional how-to books.

If you would like to purchase a science fiction collectable gift for a child or teenager, but if you are not a fan of science fiction yourself, you may be unsure as to how you should proceed.  Many consumers are pleased with all of the options that they have, in terms of purchase points.  Sci-fi collectables, including those that are mass produced or those sold as limited edition collectables can often be found for sale through professional sci-fi dealers, hobby shops, specialty sci-fi stores, and traditional retail stores, both on and offline.  Online auction websites should also be examined.
