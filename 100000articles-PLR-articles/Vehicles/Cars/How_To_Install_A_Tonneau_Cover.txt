A tonneau cover is an important tool for people who drive their trucks on a daily basis. It will protect your cargo, and will also help you conserve fuel. A locking tailgate is a device which helps keep the cover closed. In this article I will show you the first steps for installing a cover. In this example we will be using a Ford F-350, but the same basic rule applies to most trucks. Your cover is likely to come with a manual, and you will want to refer to it also.

The first thing you want to do is remove the cover and the accessories from the package. You want to make sure you follow the instructions of the manufacturer when doing this. You may also want to use a soft cloth in order to keep the rolled top from moving back and forth while inside the container. Connect the lock arm onto the bottom of tonneau handle. Once you have installed it the lock should be able to reach over the edge in order to lock the top. You can test the lock by using a key to make sure it works.

Now you want to take the cannister and place it on the rail of the truck. Place it in the area where you want it to be, but make sure you don't connect it right now. Take off the side channels and other things from the packaging to insure it is the correct length and will fit on the side rails. When you unroll the cover, it will move back inside channels that are attached to the side rails of the truck. This stops the cover from becoming loose due to wind. Take a measurement of your truck bed to make sure the channels will fit.

If the channels are too long, you may need to cut off the parts you don't need. Once you've attached them you want to make sure the tailgate has enough space to close. You will need to mark the spots on the rails where you will be placing the screws. You can add a clamp to the track while you are taking your measurements to make sure they are accurate. A grease pencil can be used to mark the locations. After this you will want to take off the clamps and get ready to drill the holes. Make sure you drill them in the correct location.

After this you will want to attach the track onto the truck bed rail. You will need to use screws for this. These are the basic steps for installing a tonneau cover, and should give you a good idea of what you will need to do.
