What is direct satellite TV? This is satellite broadcasting you can achieve through the use of satellite dishes. Before satellite television became popular in the market during the early 1990's, satellite dishes were costly metal equipments that occupy a large space of the home yard. In early times, those die hard TV fanatics would endure all these hassles and avail these expensive equipments just to set up their own dish.

Satellite TV provides a lot of solutions to cable and regular broadcast TV dilemmas. With the continuous development of satellite TV, it is becoming the popular option of numerous TV viewers.

Satellite TV is not like the usual TV broadcast. It’s using a wireless system to hand over TV programming straight to a consumer's home. Both satellite and broadcast stations transport programming through radio signal.

Broadcast stations utilize a strong antenna to transport radio waves into the surrounding field. Consumers can obtain the signal through a smaller antenna. The primary boundary of TV broadcast is range. Radio signals that are employed for TV broadcast beam a straight line from the broadcast antenna. To be able to pick up this signal, you must be in the scope of the beamed signal of the antenna. Little obstructions such as trees or low buildings are fine but huge obstructions such as land mass will mirror the radio waves.

If the land mass is flat then you would receive the TV broadcast even if its miles far from the source. But due to the shape of the land mass of the Earth the signal breaks out. Another problem that occurs with TV broadcast is it the signal becomes distorted. If you want to have a clear signal like what you can have with cable tv then you must be situated pretty near the broadcast antenna and there must not be any obstructions in sight.

What did satellite TV came up with to solve these problems about range and distortion? The problem is solved through transporting broadcast signals coming from satellites revolving around the planet. Because the satellites are high above the sky, then a lot of viewers are in the scope of the signal. Satellite TV systems transport and picks up radio signals with the use of specialized antennas known as satellite dishes.

When you avail of a satellite TV, you are on your way to viewing TV programs with much clarity and gives out 100% digital-quality broadcast and audio on each channel. Don’t be fooled by so called digital cables because they still broadcast analog channels.
