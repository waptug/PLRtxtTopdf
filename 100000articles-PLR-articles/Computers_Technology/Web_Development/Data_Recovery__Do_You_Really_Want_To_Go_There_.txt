Data recovery. Let’s hope you are never, ever, ever faced with the task of serious data recovery. If you are, it probably means your hard drive is blasted and you precious computer folders and files are nowhere to be found. Your passwords, your photographs, your secret musings, or even worse, your critical business files, bank statements, invoices, and tax records are all being held hostage in a foreign sector of cyberspace, waiting for your data recovery operation to begin.

And it didn’t have to happen. Data recovery is necessary because you just never had the time to unwrap a CD, insert it in your D: drive, and back up all those personally cherished and professionally essential files. So here you are, wondering exactly how to begin the process of data recovery.

You can start by finding the name and number of some data recovery specialists. If you have access to a functional computer with an Internet connection, just run a search on data recovery specialists and try to find one in your area. Data recovery is big business, and there are data recovery specialists everywhere there are personal computers.

When you’ve located a specialist, you can extract your fired hard drive from your PC and either take, or ship it, to the data recovery center. At the center, a data recovery specialist will examine your hard drive’s memory to determine how much of your data is recoverable, and call you with the results and the estimated cost of getting it retrieved.

The data recovery process isn’t cheap, because it requires your hard drive to be worked on in a clean room, which has to be kept completely dust free. And the data recovery specialist has to use extremely precise instruments with meticulous care to salvage as much of your data as possible, so data recovery is a slow, tedious process.

Some masters of the data recovery process have been known to salvage the files from computers which have been tire food for heavy equipment or dropped into water. Hopefully your hard drive has not been subjected to that sort of abuse, and you will have a relatively”normal” data recovery process.

Recovery specialists are professionals in getting your beloved files back to you safe and sound. They take your hard drive apart piece by piece in a clean room and recover each and every file they can from your drive.
