Cash Advances Can Be Addictive

Once you have gotten a cash advance you will feel good and happy that you overcame a financial problem, and when you have paid back all the money plus the interest you owed will feel even better.  Who wouldn’t?

But, you may become to dependant on cash advances and think "well I’ve had a cash advance and I managed to pay back all that money without a problem, so surely I can get another one if I have some more financial trouble." Maybe you can, but that could be where the trouble starts.  

You can’t become too dependant on cash advances to keep bailing you out of a hole if you keep getting into trouble.  Of course if you keep paying them back on time, then the cash advance company will be more than happy to keep doing business with you and will keep giving you the money when you request it, but dependency can be a bad thing.

If you get into financial trouble, then you will obviously want to get out of it; that is natural.  Imagine how you would feel if your friend helped you out of the same situation?  You probably wouldn’t feel too good about not paying them back.  That is what a cash advance is like:  a friend paying off a bill for you.  But if you pay off the bill, the company is off your back, and you will feel better about yourself because you did it with your own money and you didn’t rely on anyone else but yourself to get that debt off your back and out of your system.

People have been known to rely on cash advances too much, if they get in a financial bind then they can say "oh well, I’ll just give the company a call and they will help me out."  One debt will lead to another and before you know it your money will not be your money if the bills keep on piling up on you.
