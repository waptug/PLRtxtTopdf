But packing for traveling is almost like an art; and if you’re not careful you invariably end up forgetting something vital. So, it always helps to keep a bag packed and ready in case you need to rush off, out of station for a day or two.

Your travel bag

Choosing the type of luggage bag or box that you will need depends on how much you're going to be carrying and whether or not you are going to be traveling light. Ideally, for an overnight trip a small suitcase enough to fit one set of clothes, your toiletries, and perhaps your laptop or files would suffice. Try and get yourself one of those compact bags that have a telescopic handle and can be rolled around easily. They’re a lot easier to move around than draping a luggage strap around your shoulder. Also make sure you get a bag that’s large enough to contain all you need, yet fits the norms required for airline cabin baggage.
