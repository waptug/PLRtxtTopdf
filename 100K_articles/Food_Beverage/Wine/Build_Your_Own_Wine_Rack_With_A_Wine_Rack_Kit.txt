When it comes to household decorating, a new crop of do-it-yourselfers has emerged, eager to spackle, paint, measure, hammer, and hang. To keep pace, manufacturers of household products work diligently to provide the weekend warrior a bevy of projects. For wine enthusiasts who like to display their wine as well as drink it, a wine rack kit offers the perfect opportunity to build your own dynamic showcase.

A wine rack kit contains the essential parts for building your own wine rack. Just like a wine rack that you would purchase completely assembled, a wine rack kit comes in a variety of materials, styles, and sizes. So prior to choosing your wine rack kit you must first decide your preferences regarding its overall look.

First and foremost, you must consider your home’s décor. If you prefer contemporary décor then clearly you should choose a wine rack kit that blends with this style; the same holds true for a home decorated in any other style such as country or eclectic. The materials that make up the wine rack kit range from solid wood of all varieties, to metal and wrought iron. While a wood wine rack would complement a home with country flair, a wrought iron wine rack may look better in a more eclectic home.

When considering a wine rack kit it is important to evaluate the space with which you have to work. For someone living in a smaller environment, a hanging wine rack may be best suited for this space; this particular model hangs from the ceiling in any area of your home, keeping wine bottles out of the way while making a beautiful showcase for your collection. If you have a larger living space, then you may want to consider a standing wine rack that fits into a corner or against a wall. Either design is available for assembly with a wine rack kit.

Also consider your wine collection when purchasing a wine rack kit. If you prefer to only display a few nice bottles of wine, then a smaller wine rack kit that offers a smaller space for bottles will make the most sense. For a larger collection, or for the ability to also store or display stemware and barware, then a larger, more comprehensive wine rack kit may be in order.

Find your wine rack kit at any home good store – including the larger retail outlets. Or shop online to find some great deals. Either way, the wine rack kit is an inexpensive design feature and an enjoyable do-it-yourself project.
