The leaflet-label combines both the advantages of a self-adhesive label and a consumer leaflet. It can be applied directly to the product or container using conventional label applicators. The leaflet becomes visible when a resealable tab is peeled back on the outer label so the leaflet remains with the product throughout its life. Alternatively, the leaflet-label can be totally removed without damaging the product’s surface or integrity. The attached leaflet can be folded in a number of ways and it is possible for the leaflet to incorporate up to 16 pages in a fanfold style which can be a major benefit for product promotions. It can also benefit any product, such as pharmaceuticals, where additional information is needed to meet legislative requirements.
