While approaching loan provider for an unsecured debt consolidation loan, there were several fears in your mind. Many of your colleagues were against unsecured debt consolidation loans because of the very high rates that they come with. However, there was little choice with your house already serving collateral for mortgage.

However, it will be clear very soon why unsecured debt consolidation loans be used as the first preference rather than the last resort.

The very first advantage of unsecured debt consolidation loans is that home or any other asset of borrower may not be used as collateral. Thus, loan provider does not have a direct charge on the borrower’s home. This may not have any particular advantage during the normal course of the loan. However, when repayment on the unsecured debt consolidation loan has not been made, borrower gets time and opportunity to re-negotiate repayment. Loan provider however will not lose time in repossessing collateral on secured debt consolidation loans.

Debts keep on adding to themselves through interest. The larger is the time that the loan provider takes in approving loan and thus in debt settlement, the larger will the additions to debt be. Through an unsecured debt consolidation loan, borrower can safeguard himself from these unduly additions to debt. Since property valuation is not involved in unsecured debt consolidation loans, they are faster in being approved.

However, the borrower needs to be clean on the credit front. Credit history is an effective method to determine the credibility of the borrower. Loan providers will fear offering loans to borrowers with bad credit history where no collateral has been pledged.

However, this may not reject the loan applications by borrowers with bad credit altogether. There are loan providers who are risk taking and allow lending with a moderate risk. Loan providers are slowly realising that borrowers bad credit is not an absolute indicator of credibility. Many a times, borrowers with good credit too default on loans and debts. Unsecured debt consolidation loans for people with bad credit are costlier than the regular loans.

Unsecured debt consolidation loans may not allow the borrower to draw as large an amount as the secured debt consolidation loans. This is a method through which the loan provider aims to cover his risk. This again depends on the lender. A borrower whose needs are larger and instils sufficient faith in the loan provider can hope to qualify for a greater amount of unsecured debt consolidation loans.

A peculiarity of debt consolidation loans is that the loan provider designates experts to work along with the loan provider to eliminate debts. The facility extends to unsecured debt consolidation loans as well. Thus, borrowers who feared that they would have to counter debts on their own can heave a sigh of relief.

The borrowers have only one task to perform in the debt settlement process. Loan providers ask them to total the various debts that they want settled. It is recommended to include every debt, whether big or small for the purpose of debt settlement. There are two reasons in support of the statement. The borrowed amount will not increase much through the inclusion of a small debt. These small debts gradually become big by adding up the interest.

The remaining task has to be performed by the loan provider and their trained representatives. It is they who would deal with the several creditors, a duty most debtors would love to be relieved of after the regular haggling with the creditors. These trained representatives are behind the negotiations that take place on the debts. A better negotiator can help bring down the repayable amount, and thus saving a part of the unsecured debt consolidation loan for other purposes. It is to be pointed at this stage that an unsecured debt consolidation loan is a personal loan and can be used for any purpose other than debt settlement. Therefore, the loan proceeds can be used for purchasing car, financing holidays and also for undertaking home improvements.
