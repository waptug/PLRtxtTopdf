An apple a day may keep the doctor away, but it's also a healthy reminder of favorite flavors and aromas, such as homemade cider, fresh apple pie and autumn adventures to go picking in the orchard. 

Now there's a new apple in the grocery store that's likely to please the pickiest of palates: Cameo® apples are a gourmet variety noted for their thin skin. Whether eaten fresh out of hand or used in a favorite recipe, Cameos have an irresistible combination of sweet-tart taste and crisp crunch.

Born in the U.S.A., the Cameo apple was discovered as a chance seedling in the 1980s and has been grown commercially for the past six years. Cameos are a good source of fiber, vitamin C, folate and potassium-and they're rich in cancer-fighting antioxidants. Plus, one medium apple contains just 80 calories.

Here's one simple, delicious and zesty way to enjoy this Washington beauty:

Cameo Apple Salsa

Preparation time: 5 minutes

Refrigeration time: 1/2 hour

Makes: 4 cups

2 cups Cameo apples, diced 

1/2 cup red onion, diced

1/2 cup (1 large) Anaheim chili pepper, finely chopped

1 jalapeño pepper, finely chopped (optional)

1/4 cup lime juice

1 Tbsp. chopped fresh cilantro

1/4 tsp. salt

1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper

Combine all ingredients in large bowl and mix well. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes or until ready to serve.
