}Does My Credit Card Cover Air Ambulance Services During Travel?\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Credit cards
 seem to fill the pockets and purses of nearly every traveler around the world.  
Premium credit cards frequently offer benefits and perks for travelers.  These little
 extras lure consumers into using their specific credit card to make travel purchases
.  If you use credit cards when you travel, it is important to learn about the specifics
 for your particular card.  Does your credit card cover lost or stolen items away
 from home?  Does the card cover air ambulance services in an emergency?  Learning
 about such benefits will help you prepare for your next trip whether it is across
 the country or around the world.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Begin your
 quest for answers by digging out your paperwork from your credit cards.  Start 
combing through the fine print to see what your premium credit card covers and what
 exclusions apply.  After doing a little detective work, you will undoubtedly realize
 that you do have some coverage during your trip away from home.  Credit card companies
 will typically pay for lost or stolen luggage or other personal goods during a 
trip, but this feature is only effective after a deductible has been applied.  Of
 course, all credit card agreements are different, so check your card to be certain
.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 If a medical
 emergency should arise, the credit card coverage may pay to have you transported
 to the nearest medical facility.  Your premium credit card may even pay to have
 someone fly to be with you.  Yes, this is quite a nice benefit, but the card will
 not cover expenses to fly you home on an air ambulance to the hospital of your 
choice to be near family and friends.  Also, it will not cover the added expenses
 of hotel rooms, food, and other expenses associated with the family member traveling
 and staying in the area so far from home.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Due to this
 vulnerable situation, many cardholders decide to purchase a membership to an air
 ambulance service that will cover any fees associated with getting the patient 
home.  Such a company will charge a set fee, typically charged monthly or annually
.  For this fee, the covered person or family can choose to fly via air ambulance
 from any hospital far from home to the hospital of their choice.  All of this is
 at no additional cost.  Since such a flight home on a medically staffed air ambulance
 is expensive, this membership can save a great deal of money.  One trip on an air
 ambulance can cost between $10 and $75,000.\par}

 credit card won\u8217\'92t cover those expenses.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Before traveling
 away from home, it is crucial that you learn the ins and outs of your coverage 
from a credit card.  Even premium credit cards with fabulous benefits may leave 
you open and vulnerable in a medical emergency.  All credit card agreements vary
, so read the fine print very carefully.  If you are not guaranteed coverage of 
a flight home on a medically staffed air ambulance to the hospital of your choice
, then you are not adequately covered with your credit card.  Additional coverage
 is necessary to protect yourself, your family, and your wallet.    }}
