Cheap jet ink cartridges mainly come in two forms – remanufactured cartridges and compatible cartridges. Remanufactured cartridges are recycled OEM cartridges that have been disassembled, refilled and reassembled and tested. Once the recycling process is complete, the remanufactured cartridges are put up for sale. Compatible cartridges are third-party cartridges built by various manufacturers who make cartridges for different types of printer models. Of the two options available remanufactured cartridges do not have incompatibility problems.

You can save a lot of money if you buy cheap jet ink cartridges. Online sellers offer huge discounts on purchases and you may be able to save more than two-thirds of the original price. It is advised that you visit four or five websites and choose the cheapest option.

Many people are skeptic about buying cheap jet ink cartridges. But there is no need to worry if you are buying from a reputed dealer. Online sellers are able to give discounts because they don’t have to spend money on retail store expenses such as rent and electricity or paying the salesperson at the store.

Quality of print is a concern for many. Remanufactured cartridges can deliver results that could match any OEM cartridge. Compatible ink cartridges are also good. Users say that there is no difference between an original cartridge and a cheap jet ink cartridge as long as printing is restricted to plain black text. However, if your printing job is related to photographs and graphics then OEM cartridges are a better option. If you have to take printouts in large numbers make sure you gather information on the number of printouts the cheap jet ink cartridge will be able to deliver.
