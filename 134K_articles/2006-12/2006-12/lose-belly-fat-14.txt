That extra bit of padding around the middle is a fact of life for many people. With a little tweaking of the diet and some extra exercise it can be a distant memory. However, if you really want to lose belly fat you have to have the willpower and the commitment to make some important life changes.

One of the contributing factors to heart disease is being overweight. Some experts have suggested that your risk is even more increased if you are carrying that extra weight in your belly. This seems to be a bigger concern for men, but it’s not something women can ignore. If you want to lose belly fat you need to devise a plan and then strictly stick to it.

Diet is difficult for many people to change. They become accustomed to eating the same foods, many of which may not be good for them. Fast food restaurants are a favorite of many families yet they contain foods that have little nutritional value. If you want to lose belly fat, fast food has to go.

Fruits, vegetables and whole grains should form the foundation of your diet. Adding some lean meat and protein will keep it balanced and will help you to lose weight. We all hear about the importance of drinking eight glasses of water each day and it’s true that there are many benefits to doing this, including reducing your weight. Calcium should be added to your diet as well because it’s believed to help cut through belly fat.

Exercise is something of a four letter word to many people but it’s essential if you want to make a change in your waistline. If you aren’t an active person consider walking as a way to begin a program to lose belly fat. Even just walking fifteen to twenty minutes a few times a week, to start, can make a huge difference in the way you look and feel.

When you begin to notice your middle shrinking, take that as encouragement and use it to help push you along to losing more weight. It can be tempting to cheat or skip your daily exercise when you feel yourself becoming thinner, but that can sabotage all the progress you have made. If you want to be successful in your quest to lose belly fat you have to stick with the changes you’ve made for the rest of your life. 

Not only will you look great when you’ve reached your goal weight but you will also be much healthier. It pays to lose belly fat and the rewards are huge, considering that the pay-off may be a few more years alive with your loved ones.
