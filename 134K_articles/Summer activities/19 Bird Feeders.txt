Bird Feeders

Kids are naturally attracted to animals and will love the birds that come to eat off of their 
homemade bird feeders.  The following instructions are for a very simple bird feeder that 
can be made again and again.  Once you put out food for birds and they start coming on a 
regular basis you should continue to feed them as they are rely on the feeders as a food 
source.

What you will need for this simple bird feeder is a piece of string or yarn, cereal in the 
shape of an “O”, peanut butter and birdseed.  It is going to be hung from a tree branch 
once completed. 

Give each child their own piece of string (can be anywhere from 6-12 inches) and have 
them string the cereal onto the string until it is full with about one inch left on each end.  
Take the string back and tie the ends together.  If you do not want this to turn into a 
messy activity, you can take the bird feeders outside as they are and hang on a tree 
branch.  

But to make them even tastier for the winged friends who will come you can smear 
peanut butter onto the cereal.  Once there is a coating on all the cereal pieces roll the 
string in a birdseed mix and it will stick to the peanut butter.  Bring the bird feeder 
outside and hang it so birds can come to eat.  

Be sure to place the bird feeder in a location that can be seen from inside the house.  The 
children are going to want to watch as the birds enjoy the meal they made for them.  As a 
bonus part of this activity, see how many different birds they children can identify as they 
come to eat the food.
