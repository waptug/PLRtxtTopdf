Romantic weekend getaways can be a second honeymoon or your first vacation together. When you don't have the time or money for a long trip, try one of the following.

<P><b>Luxuriate Together</b>

<P>Spending time at a nice hotel is the most obvious and common romantic weekend getaway, and with good reason. It is wonderful to be waited on and relax in a hot tub together. The best hotels for this will have a pool, a hot tub (preferably in the room) and even a lounge where you might be able to go dancing.

<P>In Michigan, this might be the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island. This is where they filmed the Christopher Reed movie, "Somewhere In Time." There are no cars, so you'll have see the island together by horse carriage. 

<P><b>Romantic Weekend Getaways - Outdoors</b>

<P>If you both enjoy getting outside, you may want to consider a camping weekend. Whether you want to really rough it, and put on the backpacks, or just rent an RV and find a beautiful park to visit, this is a great way to have some quality time together. Wherever you live, there are great outdoor destinations within a couple hours.

<P>A great example is the Hot Well Dunes Recreation Area, near Safford Arizona. There are two hot spring pools to soak in, and millions of acres of desert to explore. My wife and I loved collecting beautiful rocks together, and sitting around the fire with fellow campers each night. We also enjoyed regular soakings in the hot springs.

<P><b>Doing Something New Together</b>

<P>It can be very romantic to share new experiences together. Even when things don't go as planned, you are creating common memories that bring you closer together. Why not try something new this weekend?

<P>An example of this could be mountain biking in Moab, Utah. If you live near Seattle, you might consider a guided climb up Mount Ranier together. If you are near the coasts or the Great Lakes, you could take a charter sailing or fishing trip together. Amtrak has some great scenic routes you could travel in a weekend.

<P>Are romantic weekend getaways expensive? Sometimes, but the only requirement is that they are romantic. There is a way to get away no matter what your budget is. Why not start planning now?
