It doesn’t matter if you’re staying in Florence or Fiji, you can find a hotel that suits you from one of the categories below.

Truly luxurious

These hotels are designed and run to ensure that you want for nothing during your stay. From chauffeur-driven airport transport in anything from a Bentley to a seaplane, to breakfast prepared to your exact instructions, the sole purpose of these hotels is to immerse you in luxury from start to finish. Although prices for some of these hotels can be high, particularly when they are set in exotic locations, the standards of design, décor, furnishings, facilities and service make every penny count.

City chic

Eclectic furnishings, complementary textile and ethnic accessories; or modern designer sofas, white walls and exclusive dining – city boutique hotels can either be an oasis of calm amid the hustle and bustle of a 24-hour metropolis or they can put you right in the heart of the action. These hotels are often the best way to experience a new city, because the staff can help with maps, directions, tickets, dining and anything else you need in order to make the most of your stay.

Rural retreat

Using wonderful buildings such as old chateaux, mills and castles, and taking advantage of acres of vineyards or olive groves, or fabulous views across the countryside, a rural retreat hotel could be exactly what you need to turn your trip to Tuscany into a delight of the senses. Design always complements the surroundings and these boutique hotels offer peace and solitude, with activities and visits never far away for those who want to explore.
