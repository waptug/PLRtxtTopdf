Home study is one of the most popular ways to learn anything,and has been for a while. You may find this especially useful as a method of learning another language, as it allows you the freedom to go at your own pace and learn at your own speeds. This will make sure your knowledge and vocabulary is thorough, rather than being patchy. Modern home study courses can include anything from CDs, MP3s, even video to help you get your pronunciation and accent down.

Another traditional method of learning another language is a night or evening class. These can usually be found in your local community centre or community college. Courses like this are not expensive, and you will often find that there is some form of concession available, or even lessons that are free altogether. Benefits of learning to speak French like this can be the opportunity to interact with others, as well as participation in field trips and even some real trips to France. Nothing will better your accent than speaking to French people!

For those that perhaps already have some experience of speaking French or working with a French accent, there is always the idea of a French study vacation. These are readily available and easily found on the web, and what better excuse to travel to Paris and see the sights? Obviously, learning a language in this fashion is just about the best way to actually get to grips with it and put it into use, but the downside is that travelling to Europe is a whole lot more expensive that travelling to your local college!

Another method of learning French that may fall on the expensive side is some private tuition. If you can afford it, this is great, possibly the next best thing to travelling there as you will often find that the teachers are native French speakers, with a wealth of experience of teaching people how to speak their home tongue. Many tutors will have their own tips and tricks to get you remembering and expanding your vocabulary on a daily basis, so if you opt for this choice be ready to make some fast progress.

As you've seen, learning French is not as difficult as it first seems-with the advances of modern technology and the internet, you are only a click away from a French lesson whenever you want one.
