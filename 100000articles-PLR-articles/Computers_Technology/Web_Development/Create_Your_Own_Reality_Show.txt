Do you love watching reality shows on television? Have these captivated your mind since becoming popular a few years ago? If so, there is a chance that you have thought about creating your own reality show. After all, the ideas have to come from somewhere, right? But before you get too excited about this, you should know that working with the big producers is tough business. They hear thousands of ideas a year, and even if you get through to the right person you are going to be hard pressed to win their business. So what is your other option? Simply put, you can look into creating your own reality show. This is easier than ever before thanks to the ever increasing popularity of the digital age.

Believe it or not, with the technology that is available you can create a reality show without the backing of a big producer or television station. This is not to say that you are going to be able to do this in a matter of hours, but if you are serious you can get the job done sooner rather than later.

There is a lot that goes into creating a reality show; even if you are working on your own. First off, you need to come up with an idea. If you have made it this far there is a good chance that you already know what you want your reality show to be based on. Your next step, and most important, is to decide how you are going to shoot the shows. This is the biggest obstacle, but the one that the digital age has helped with in more ways than one. When it comes down to it, you do not need tons of expensive equipment in order to create your own reality show.

You will need to have a quality video camera to start. While these can be expensive if purchased new, you can get a used model for half the price if you search far and wide. Make sure that you get a camera that not only produces quality video, but also something that you are comfortable with. Remember, this will have a lot to do with the way that your reality show turns out.

Finally, it is time for the fun stuff. Once you shoot the first episode it is time to make it live via a streaming web video. Of course, you may want to have your own website set up before you finish so that you can upload the video right away. If this does not suit your situation, why not upload your reality show to a site such as http://youtube.com? This is a great way to get your streaming video in front of those who will be able to give you feedback, and maybe even create other opportunities for you.

As you can see, through the use of streaming video you can create your very own reality show. Who needs a big budget or well known producer?
