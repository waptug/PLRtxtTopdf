The holiday spirit brings many forms of celebrations, gifts, decorations and stationery. Stationery means the letterheads and cards that are sent and exchanged in holiday spirit amongst family members and friends. This stationery makes the holiday season feel more special. The main reason stationery of any form is exchanged or sent to anyone is for correspondence or for sending wishes. Instead of sending plain stationery, the holiday spirit can be spread by sending personalized stationery designed for the holiday season. 

Personalized holiday cards give your holiday cards a special touch and makes it stand out in the holiday season. Nowadays the demand of personalized holiday cards has increased so much that there are lots of firms found both online and off line that produce such cards for people&#8217;s use. These holiday cards are usually silkscreen printed that are printed on bright white and cream papers. One of the main reasons for using a silkscreen card is that it produces vibrant colors and rich metallic. This silkscreen printing is a lengthy process wherein each card is run through the press for each color. So if the design has four different colors, it goes through the press four different times before it is actually complete. 

The printing firms of holiday themed stationery have separate categories for different seasons and holidays. We have to decide on the design series that fits your needs and ideas for the printing of the stationery. Once the design is fixed on, you then have to choose the greetings card and texture of the paper you wish to use for the card. It is always better to choose paper that has a rich look as it makes the recipient feel happy as you had spent so much for him. If required, you could also choose to have your return address printed on the back envelope flap for the convenience of the recipient. The holiday card gets a better look if you also get a matching envelope lining for the card. This also enhances the holiday spirit with both a holiday spirited card and envelope.

While making your holiday greeting card, you could also include your logo and a picture of your department, company or organization for an extra personal touch to the card. So it is always better to create a logo for your company using vector graphics so that the logo can be resized both big and small for the convenience for printing. This logo can also be used to print holiday themed letterheads and business cards for the holiday season. If required, you could also add a holiday message to give the personal touch to the stationery.
