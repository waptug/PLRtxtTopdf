All of your copies should be correctly formatted with no errors or discrepancies. The CD or DVD duplication services should also guarantee a time frame for your CDs/DVDs to be done.

<b>2. Provider should employ the latest technology</b>
The next set of tips you can use is to find CD or DVD duplication services that employ the newest and latest technology to produce the duplications. Some of these can be operated by a computer and some of then can even operate without the use of a computer. 

When you check around for duplication services, ask the staff about the technology they use. If the staff does not seem very knowledgeable about what they use for their CD duplication, then you probably shouldn't use them for your duplications.
