For some families, Grandmother's warm apple pie or Aunt Jean's chocolate chip cookies are traditions without which family meals are not complete. But this season, Americans may be taking a different route to a great-tasting dessert. 

Now, it is easier than ever before to cook and bake reduced-sugar treats by using the all-new SPLENDA® Brown Sugar Blend - a mix of brown sugar and Splenda Brand Sweetener - great for those looking to lower their sugar intake without sacrificing taste. Splenda Brown Sugar Blend can be used almost anywhere brown sugar is used because it retains its sweetness under high temperatures with a great molasses flavor and moistness.
