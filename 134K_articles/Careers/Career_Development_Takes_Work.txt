Do you currently have the career of your dreams? If so, congratulations on all your hard work, because I'm quite sure that your success and accomplishment didn't happen over night. If you do not have the career you have always dreamed of, do not worry, you can get there. Career development isn't easy, but it is definitely worth it.

Career development can mean a lot of things. Here, for my purposes, I simply mean doing the things you have to do to get the career you really want. The first step in the process of career development is to figure out - really figure out - the career you want to have. This may be harder than it seems. You really need to know yourself, know what you're good at, and know what excites you. Not many people last long in a career that they hate. Career development begins with taking a close look at yourself. See a career counselor for even more help or to take tests that will help you to determine your personality and jobs that will fit it well.

Once you have determined a career or two that seems like it will fit you and your dreams, continue with your career development by discovering what needs to happen for you to be qualified for the career you want. Career development does not happen in an instant or even in a year, it may take years of hard work to get to where you want to be. It is important to be realistic about your goals and about the process. Does more education need to take place for your career development? Or perhaps you just need some special training courses in your field but you do not need another degree? Find these things out and then begin pursuing it.

Career development is important because I am convinced that it is important that people spend their lives on things they care about and feel like they can do well at. There is nothing worse than spending years of your life in an unsatisfying career. Fortunately, you do not have to let that be the story of your life. Take proactive steps that put you in control of your career development.

I guess what I'm simply trying to say is this: life is hard. Work is hard. Work is much easier and life is much better when it is doing a career that you love. Believe that it is possible for you to have a career that you love and then commit to whatever career development is necessary for you. It will be worth it for years to come.
