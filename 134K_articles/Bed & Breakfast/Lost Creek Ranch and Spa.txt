Lost Creek Ranch and Spa

Located between Grand Teton National Park and Bridger Teton Forest, in Wyoming, is an incredible family vacation spot called Lost Creek Ranch and Spa.  Your vacation will start off right with the complimentary transportation they offer from the nearby airport.  Rates for the ten cabins and twenty rooms include all meals.  That is just the beginning.

Children under the age of six stay completely free and staff will provide cribs upon request.  During the day, there are supervised children's activities so the adults may enjoy some time on their own.  Activities include a heated pool, whirlpool, exercise equipment, tennis, hayrides, lawn games and a game room.  Ridding instruction is available for both children and adults.

The spa offers a sauna and team room as well as massage.  What a wonderful way to spend the evening after a long day of vigorous activity.

Each of the cabins includes a private porch, refrigerators and fireplaces.  Picnic tables provide a nice outdoor experience for the whole family.  The staff will also do your laundry free of charge so you can spend your time doing more enjoyable things.

Dinners are served family style and offer two choices each evening.  Breakfast can be either a full continental one or your choice from a large menu.  Lunch is served buffet style and offers a large variety of choices.  Kids can either eat with their parents or enjoy a special kid's dinner with their newly found friends.  They have a special menu of kid-favored food to choose from with the second option.

Not only is the staff highly trained in their particular occupation, but Lost Creek Ranch offers something found rarely elsewhere, a one to one staff and guest ratio.  No matter what you need or want, there is always someone ready and willing to accommodate your wishes.
