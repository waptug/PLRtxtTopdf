Bass fly fishing is a type of fishing that involves using an artificial fly. It is different from traditional fishing methods in that fly anglers cast a hook that generally has bits of feather, fur, foam, yarn, or other similar material attached using thread to form what is referred to as a ‘fly', as opposed to using worms or other bait. 

Pro bass fishing is just like the ordinary fly fishing that we know. The only difference is that it entails the presence of professionals in fishing. These professionals are those that are well respected in the line of fishing. They were considered professionals because of their dedication and love in fishing including their contributions. 

There are the types of fly fishing. The best known and the most classic is he dry fly fishing. The fisherman uses an artificial fly, which he casts so that it will float on the water. The fly will pass over the fish, which will hopefully rise up and bite it. The fisherman then tries to control the fish's attempts to escape, tiring it enough to bring it in to be retrieved from the water with a landing net. 

Many anglers prefer this type of fly fishing because everything can be seen - the angler casts at a fish he can see, the fly is easily visible on the surface of the water, and he can see the fish take the fly. The only drawback to this is that trout and other fish tend to feed underwater, and therefore are not as likely to come up to take a dry fly. 

The second form of fly fishing is what is known as nymph fishing. When the flies lay eggs in the river or lake, the eggs hatch out as nymphs, make their way to the surface and they hatch into a fly. Therefore, nymph fishing utilizes imitations of different nymphs that are weighted to stay below the surface of the water. This type of fishing is often considered more challenging, as all the action takes place beneath the surface.

Bass fly fishing has become an increasingly popular sport, and most anglers will agree that it's not just about catching fish. Some anglers would even regard fly fishing as a kind of religion, and most consider it a relaxing pastime that can be enjoyed by people from all walks of life. It also appeals to the more environmentally conscious, as it is less harmful to the fish than many other techniques, and most anglers return their catch.

For beginners, a basic rod-and-reel set is enough; the features and materials aren't necessarily important. It is more important that the beginning fisherman learn how to use the rod, and become comfortable with it before moving on to more complex pieces of equipment.
