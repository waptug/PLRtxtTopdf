Often, people find the need to purchase another car than keep mending the current one, because of their poor decision making when purchasing the existing one.

Scam and con artists are skilled at getting into you head and detecting something you have an emotional or preference stake in. Keep focused on buying a car and try to avoid the small talk with the salesperson.
