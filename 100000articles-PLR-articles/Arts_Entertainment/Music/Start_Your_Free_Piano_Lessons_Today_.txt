How fast you learn depends on your desire to play and succeed.

Piano lessons are structured for the beginner who wants to learn, as well as for the experienced piano player who wants to take a refresher course to improve their playing skills. Courses are structured so you learn to play by ear and rhythm in such a way that you can duplicate any song or sound you hear.

Once you learn about notes and rhythm, you will be on your way to playing simple songs and then building your skills and confidence to a higher level of experience. All you need to do is make sure you complete each lesson and learn it well before you move on to your next lesson.
