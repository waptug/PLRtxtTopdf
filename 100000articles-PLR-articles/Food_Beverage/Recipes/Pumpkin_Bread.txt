Article Body:
Now here is a recipe that can be used during the Thanksgiving season as well as the Christmas season although when it comes to food and of course I know how to prepare all the recipes that I share with everyone everyday can be a holiday for me depending on what my taste is for a particular day.
Every persons taste is different and that is what makes the world go around, but there isn’t much that I don’t like when it comes to the sweet things.
Remember your ingredients should be at room temperature.


1-2/3 cups all purpose flour
1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon cinnamon
½ teaspoon salt
2 large eggs slightly beaten
1 ½ cups sugar 1 ½ cups canned solid pack pumpkin
½ cup vegetable oil
1/3 cup each walnuts and raisins


Preheat your oven to 350 degrease. Grease a 9 x 5 inch loaf pan.
In a 5 quart mixing bowl combine the first 5 ingredients then add eggs, sugar, pumpkin, oil and mix until well combined then add your nuts and raisins and mix until smooth.
Pour your mix into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 70 minutes or until a pick placed into the center comes out clean.
Cool in pan on wire rack 10 minutes then remove from pan and continue to cool on same rack.
Well now it’s time to eat it, get out the butter and coffee and “enjoy”.
