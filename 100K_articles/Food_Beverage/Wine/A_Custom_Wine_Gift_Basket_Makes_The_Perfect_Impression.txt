With wine gaining in popularity over more traditional beverages, a custom wine gift basket makes the perfect gift for almost any occasion.  Most people are becoming aware of not only the health benefits of various wines, but the enhancement qualities of wine when complimenting almost any meal.

A reason to give a custom wine gift basket to a special friend, family, or business acquaintance, is that wine is an excellent addition to food in general.  In the tradition of European dining, a plate of cheese, bread and crackers complimented by a fine bottle of wine, can make a meal in itself.  An elegant dinner would be flawed without a good bottle of wine, red or white, to compliment the entrée.

A Wine Gift Basket Can Make Any Occasion Special

If you need a gift for a special occasion, like an anniversary, birthday, or holiday, a wine gift basket with select food items is always a ‘hit’.  A gift basket for your wine lover friends can turn a standard dinner affair into something very special.  For an anniversary, why not include a nice bottle of champagne and a set of champagne glasses to the basket for the celebration.

A Custom Wine Gift Basket for that Personal Touch  

There are many fine merchants that provide ready-made food and wine gift baskets, but if you really want to give a gift that is remembered and cherished, why not personalize your gift basket? 

Custom wine gift basket merchants offer a service that lets you pick and choose what items you want included in your gift basket.  This allows you to select only those items that you know the recipient of the wine gift basket will enjoy, and therefore, make it more personal.  For example, if the wine basket is going to an avid golfer, items such as golf balls, tees, divot tool, or golf towel could be added.

Another nice personal touch is to select a wine gift box set that has the name of the individual imprinted on the box.   Some merchants offer boxed sets that allow you to select the person’s favorite wines to add an even more personal touch.

The ultimate in personalization is to give a custom wine gift basket with the individual’s name, or special occasion, printed right on the label.   Even the recipient’s picture, or a company logo, can be added to fit the occasion.   You might think that this wine gift idea would be very expensive, but it can be done quite reasonably and in relatively small bottle quantities.    

Give a Wine Gift That Will Be Remembered

The key to making your custom wine gift basket special is to know the likes and dislikes of the person receiving the basket.  Does the person have any favorite hobbies or pastimes? If you are not sure, why not ask a mutual friend or family member.  This little extra effort can make all the difference in how the gift is remembered.  Why not let the person know that you care by giving them a custom wine gift basket with their favorite items?
