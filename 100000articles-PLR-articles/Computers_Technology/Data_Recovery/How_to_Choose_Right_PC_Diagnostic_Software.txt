Computer Diagnostics is a need to keep a healthy operating system and vital for business productivity, where a failure can be a costly mistake. PC diagnostic software can determine hardware and software conditions and possible failures, as well as current settings and connectivity.

A PC diagnostic program can also suggest the best performance settings in order to get the most of your system according to your hardware specifications. In addition, a PC diagnostic tool can help you to identify potential problems that can damage your hard drive or any other piece of hardware.

Some companies provide troubleshooting tools to test your PC’s electronic circuits, in the form of system plug-ins or stand-alone applications. Computer Diagnostics should also be able to check other computer components such as the BIOS, serial and parallel ports, USB and Ethernet ports, etc.

Choosing the best PC diagnostic software depends on your computer related knowledge. You may find a PC diagnostic program worthless if you do not understand what a benchmark diagnosis means, or cannot make changes in the settings that the PC diagnostic tool may suggest.

Computer Diagnostics provide end user with intuitive diagnostics tools for troubleshooting while improving performance. However, some of them can be risky if you do not understand what they can do, like those including the ability to reformat any type of hard drive.

Most software developers state, "use it at your own risk" because of the lack of knowledge that can lead also to massive data loss. Although data can be recovered, it is a painful process because of the required proper software or you may have to take the hard drive to a service center that can restore and reformat your hard drive.

Even then, there are no guarantees of getting 100% of your data back, so be careful choosing software intended for Computer Diagnostics, and always read before clicking any "OK" message that may pop up. 

If a PC diagnostic tool returns the parameters of the hard drive, and allows toggling the IRQ directly to determine which I/O port is at which IRQ, make sure you understand what all this means before proceeding, because the software can read, write, overwrite and edit most values.

Perhaps the best PC diagnostic software is that which can only read, generating log files or an overall detailed report of your computer including all its components. 

If the PC diagnostic program cannot write, the possibilities to damage your hardware or destroy your content are very low, although other problems such as a buggy, unstable version can ruin your operating system.
