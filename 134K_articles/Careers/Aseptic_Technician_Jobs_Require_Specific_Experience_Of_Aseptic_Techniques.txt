<b>Aseptic Techniques and Technicians</b>

Aseptic techniques aim at keeping the concerned area free of microorganisms that cause the contamination etc. People are the greatest source of contamination and at the same time, people are needed to carry out processes. Aseptic technician's job is to help achieve desired levels of sterilization in the environment where processes are being carried out and monitor contamination levels.

Use of barriers between people and processes, clean rooms, sterile gloves and such practices help eliminate or minimize levels of possible contamination. The aseptic technician has to be familiar with the practices adopted and must have the training to understand the issues involved.

In pharmaceutical production, aseptic techniques involve mechanical aspects such as ensuring that the equipment, clean rooms and utilities are operated and maintained in a way that lead to an aseptic environment in production areas. This typically requires a mechanical aptitude, and engineers with relevant experience are considered for aseptic technician jobs.

In addition to aseptic practices and industry standards, the aseptic technician will also have to be familiar with applicable regulations so that the person can oversee compliance with these.
