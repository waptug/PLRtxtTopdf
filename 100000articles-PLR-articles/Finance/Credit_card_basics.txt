The Negative Aspect of Surge in Credit Card usage

•	Generally everybody does not meet the eligibility criterion to hold a credit card. yet in order to enhance their sales and as part of marketing strategies, companies, private banks etc. do away with giving these cards to who so ever caters even to the minimum terms and conditions.

•	The loan factor-the cards provide you with huge credit limits. The consumer ignorant of the forthcoming trouble, keeps on drawing money from his card and most often when he realizes his mistake, it is too late. He not only comes in the debt of the money he withdrew but also the massive interest that is charged by these companies and banks.


•	Many credit card companies provide lucrative offers almost every month in the form of incentives. These incentives are basically meant to boost the sale of their product. Incentives like travel programs, gas purchases etc. are a very common phenomenon these days. But one should not get lured by these for it is well said that everything that glitters is not gold. Initially the cards might be promising for some cheerful moments but once you become habitual of them they can land you in soup.

•	The addictiveness- it is most often the addictiveness of these cards that is a source of trouble. People, who keep on drawing from the bank’s or company’s credit, suffer largely.


•	Debit cards are believed to be different from the credit cards. But actually the difference is minute. A debit card can also be used as a credit card at times and there are some eminent banks that charge fee with the debit cards too. So more or less the situation remains to be the same.

When you make up your mind to go for a debit card, consult some advisor. Know the details of the interest rate, the tenure to repay the amount and other such things. Do not be carried away by brand names. Just make a survey first and then decide which one to go for.
