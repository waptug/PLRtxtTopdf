Highland Glen Lodge


Moose don't have their own bed and breakfasts, or do they? Don't be surprised to find these Alaskan natives visiting Highland Glen Lodge in Anchorage, Alaska. This quaint Tudor mansion belies the elegance within. Your first view makes you think you've stepped off American soil and straight to the English countryside. Highland Glen Lodge is in the shadows of the Chugach Mountains with breathtaking views of the rugged mountains and Cook Inlet. 

The English theme carries through to the breakfast fare. You are treated to a blend of English/Scottish country dining mixed with the flavor of the Alaskan frontier. After a delightful breakfast join your family and guests in the Great room. Relax over coffee on the plush furnishings. Floor to ceiling windows offer a spectacular view of the Alaskan countryside. 

For your first or fiftieth honeymoon, a stay in the Highlander room is a must. Not only is there a king sized bed, but also a tower and a balcony. You can go from the lounge into the double Jacuzzi for added enjoyment. To make the honeymoon complete, in room breakfast is available. The Glen View room also has a king sized bed with a beautiful view of Cook Inlet. Planning on having three or more in your party? Then The Birchwoods has the extra room with a twin bed. For the ultimate in a family or group gathering, the three room Woodlands Suite is just what you are looking for. There is a private sauna, one king sized bed and two queen sized. Alaska may seem to be the last frontier with civilization many miles away; each room does have Internet access. Although out of sight of the world, you are still in close contact. 

All of the rooms come complete with a hot tub and access to the roof patio lounge.
