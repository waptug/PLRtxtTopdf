Why You Need An MBA!

The massive expansion in MBA provision has, in many ways, made the qualification more attractive to employers. This is because of a shift in emphasis in MBA content, and a major change in those studying for the qualification. Both changes were pioneered primarily in the UK, where the typical student is now in their late twenties or thirties, has considerable management experience, and is more likely to be studying while working rather than incurring the opportunity costs of full-time study. In fact, many managers are now studying MBA programs from around the globe, without detriment to the quality of their student experience or the value of the qualification.

Marketing: People who are in charge of marketing the goods or services of any organization need to be able to create effective marketing strategies and convey their message to people efficiently. An MBA program equips its students with theoretical knowledge as well as practical marketing skills, which can help in getting jobs in the marketing field. With the MBA degree, you can look to become no less than a product manager responsible for marketing.

Am I A Good MBA Candidate?

As the MBA is a very intense program, not to mention very expensive, schools are looking out for those applicants who come across as having prior knowledge about the program and are also clear about what they want from the program.

You must have a really solid and complete application file. List down all your qualifications and your work experience in a way that complements them. Do NOT leave any part of the application form blank.

If your MBA application is as good as it should be, then you may be short listed for the interviews. This is another critical aspect of the MBA admissions process and here the interviewer can physically determine how good a candidate you are for their MBA degree.
