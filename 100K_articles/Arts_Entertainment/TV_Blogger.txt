Summary:
I suppose it's a good thing when it's damn near impossible to choose the DVD of the month. Both Extras and Weeds are so brilliant shows you couldn't go wrong with either. I chose Weeds for the simple fact that it's comprised of 12 episodes as opposed to Extras' six.

DVD of the Month - Weeds: Season 2

The second season of Weeds took it to another level. Mary Louise Parker is absolutely amazing (although she refuses to marry me) as Nancy Botwin, the matriarchal drug dealer. Parker manages a comedic touch in the face of dramatic obstacles with an understated elegance. Meanwhile, Doug (Kevin Nealon), Nancy's business associate and accountant, proves himself one of the funniest characters in comedy today (He's Dwight Shrewt funny folks). The rest of the cast is wickedly funny

Extras: The Complete Second Season

Don't take this as a knock on Extras in anyway. It's as much a masterpiece and deserves all the credit in the world. In fact, I already gave it some love.
