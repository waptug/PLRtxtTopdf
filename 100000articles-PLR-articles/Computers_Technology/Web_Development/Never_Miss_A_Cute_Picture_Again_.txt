How happy would it make you to buy a small, easy-to-use, light-weight Digital Camera which takes clear, crisp photographs for less than $100.00? What if we added to that a rugged, fast, reliable Camera? Well, that's what the Kodak EasyShare C530 offers you. Are you ready to buy? Well, not so fast. As good as it sounds, this might not be the Camera for you.

To start with, this camera is not perfect, better than it's predecessors, but not without it's drawbacks. More importantly, though, you should never judge a camera solely by it's features.  Rather, you should judge it by your needs. Figure out what you really want out of an inexpensive digital camera and you will know whether or not the Kodak C530 is right for you.

Do you crave richly detailed, zoom shots? Do high quality, rich, vibrant photographs make your eyes light up in excitement? Then you may want to check out higher end (and higher priced) digital cameras. However, if all you want is a rugged, simple, easy-to-use digital camera which you can take virtually anywhere with you, then read on! The Kodak Easy Share C530 may be everything you need.

3 Great Uses for the Kodak EasyShare C530

1) Do you like to hike? Go backpacking in the great outdoors? Well then, a solid little digital camera which you can easily pop into your backpack or pocket is a nice deal, isn't it? After all, you may not want to lug around a large, heavy camera while trekking through the woods. At the same time you want something that can take a beating, at least a light one. If that's the case, then consider the Kodak C530. This small, light-weight camera is great for outdoor trips.

2) Do you have kids? Do you like to photograph them (I hope so). Well, then, owning an easily transportable digital camera which you can take out at a moments notice helps ensure that you never miss those precious, once-in-a-lifetime shots. Just drop this camera in your pocket or purse and you're prepared whenever cuteness strikes and begs to be photographed.

3) And speaking of kids, perhaps yours would like a digital camera of their own. If so, what more could your kids want than an easy-to-use digital camera which takes good quality photos and easily hooks up to the computer? Your kids can almost literally take this camera out of the box and start shooting. What's more, this camera is the perfect size and weight for those small, little hands.

At the end of the day, whether or not you should buy the EasyShare C530 depends on what you want to get out of your digital camera. For the photo enthusiasts out there, consider spending a few more bucks and getting a digital camera which will make you happy. You'll feel too constrained with this camera. For those of you on the go, this portable, inexpensive Digital Camera allows you the comfort of knowing that you always have a decent digital camera on hand. And, as we mentioned before, you can get it for less than $100.00 (that is, if you take advantage of the discounts available at websites like Amazon.com). Better digital cameras do abound, and you may want to consider them. But if your wallet looks like it's been on the Akins diet, then the C530 may provide you with an affordable digital camera solution. And let's not forget your kids! The Kodak C530 makes a great introductory camera for your children, offering virtually everything a budding, young Ansel Adams needs to start his or her illustrious photography career. And if they just want to have fun with it, it's great for that too!
