Article Body:
Newsflash: someone said that you are a lowlife. Not directly, of course. But they said it.

If you've ever had a brief period of financial trouble, and couldn't pay your obligations for any reason, and you had the opportunity to listen to what others said about people in your same situation, you've know what people think about people who don't pay their bills. They are labeled as less than human, with no thought to the individual's situation.

They are labeled as bums and deadbeats. They are blacklisted as the scum of the earth. Snakes are better than a person who doesn’t pay his bills on time. They're deadbeats. And because they are considered this, and you hear it, might be inclined to put yourself in this same class because of their accusations.

In short: you've labeled yourself as a very bad person because of the things that they have said..

You've heard that, and you have applied all that talk to yourself.  Those around you would never say such things to your face, but when they talk about others that have bad credit, for whatever reason, they always speak about them in a negative light, and you feel something deep inside..

They speak as if nothing bad every happens. That life sometimes takes people down a path they didn't want to go down. That sometimes, people unknowingly dig financial holes they can't handle. That sometime people are just stupid, and make stupid mistakes.

Yes, life does happen, and people do stupid things, and people go down paths that they can't control. And the worst thing about it all is, it could only be for an instant or a season, these side paths. But sadly, in many cases, they have a long-term impact on one's financial future.

But, even if you're going through one of these times, it doesn't have to be that way. With a little persistence, you can find lenders who are ready an willing to give people a second chance. 

If you need a car or a truck for transportation, and can't get financing because of a past mistake, or a series of mistakes, you should consider taking a look at a bad credit car loan. There are many people who automatically think that a bad credit car loan means high, rip off rates, but that doesn't have to be the case...if you know how to shop for a loan.

You can get a bad credit car loan for very comparable rates with a regular loan. Consider that 6 out 10 people do no shopping for a car loan at a competitive rate. That means only 4 out of 10 people actually took the time to find another offer outside of the one that they got from their bank or the dealer. That's money that they could have saved, and extra savings that they left on the table when negotiating a new or used car purchase.

Our site has a comprehensive list of the top 10 dealer and financing auto rip offs. You should check it out, as well as our mini-fact page with more information of getting the best deal (even with bad credit) and bad credit car loan lender listings.

Because even so called "bad people" need a break once in a while.
