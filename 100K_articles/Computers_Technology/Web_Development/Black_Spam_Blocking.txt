What is it meant by the term "blacklist"? It can be interpreted in various ways. It can be defined in relations with culture, hobbies and many more. But, in this context, the definiton of blacklist is, of course, computer related.

A blacklist is actually just a simple list of email addresses or websites that have gained the fame when it comes to sending tons and tons of spam. If a specific email address or domain is part of this blacklist, then that link is therefore blocked. This means you will never receive any form of email from them ever again.

It certainly is such a big help when it comes to blocking those annoying emails you get. If you are experiencing problems regarding spam mail, then you can try using blacklists to ease your problem.

But still, it can sometimes be fooled. Nowadays, people are getting smarter and smarter by the second. They have found ways to be able to deceive blacklists. If he or she is an expert on this topic then his or her email address will not be blocked.

This proves that blacklists are not as effective as they are initially thought to be. They are now so easy to fool that spammers just get pass them. If you think or believe that your blacklist is not doing any good against these said spammers, then you should just uninstall them and put them away.

Blacklists are sometimes thought to be such a waste of time because it just makes you expect of good things to happen. But actually, they do not do anything against spam. They just let them pass. This means that blacklists need to be developed some more. There is a huge space for improvement.

You just do not have any idea about it, but some viruses may have invaded your computer's system. You now have to dillemmas to solve. You need to free your computer space because of the enormous space spam took. And you also have to worry about having your hard drive scanned. You just get more hassles.

However, do not just think of trashing your blacklists. Why? It is because they can still be useful. They serve as pressure instruments in preventing Internet service providers from relaying spam. They are, in fact, very good with this. But still, this is probably the only thing blacklists are good at.

To sum it all up, blacklists are good with blocking spam, but it is absolutely no match for those advanced spam mail. You can also get other spam blocking software just to back you up.
