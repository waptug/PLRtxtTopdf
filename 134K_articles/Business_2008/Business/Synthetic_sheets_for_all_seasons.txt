A company has introduced Polylitho self-adhesive sheets as a ready-to-print product designed for conventional litho and letter-press processes. It is also suitable for screen printing and for variable information systems such as dot matrix, thermal transfer and certain types of ink-jet printing. And it may be over-varnished.

Made of good clay coated polyolefin film with a matt finish and smoothness, Polylitho is laminated to a heavy bleached kraft backing material. This ensures appropriate dimensional stability, flatness and troublefree machine feed, says the company.

Polylitho provides a water, grease, oil and tear resistant sheet labelling material that is ideal for prestigious promotional and point of sale applications where durability is a criterion.

Promising clean, sharp print definition and clear contrast that enhances scanability, it should be particularly suitable for bar coding. Typical end uses include luggage, forestry and horticultural tags, labels for goods in transit, and plastic bottles.

As the coating applied to Polylitho’s film surface is slightly absorbent, conventional litho inks designed for coated papers may be used – as long as the ink/water balance is well controlled. For close register, multi-colour work involving high solid colour areas, oxidation inks are preferred.

Polylitho prints, converts, feels and looks like a coated paper and yet offers the strength and durability temperatures of minus 60 to plus160°F. Humidity has no effect on its diamensional stability and, because of its UV resistance and weathering characteristics, Polylitho will not shrink or become brittle and may be used outdoors for up to one and a half to two years. It is also recyclable as an HDPE.
