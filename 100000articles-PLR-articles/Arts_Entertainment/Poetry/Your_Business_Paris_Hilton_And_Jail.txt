Even in Jail Paris Hilton knows how to create buzz. As a business owner creating a healthy dose of buzz about your business is a must. Of course, you want your business to be known for skills more valuable than getting yourself in trouble.

You have to be determined to generate buzz about your products or services. The buzz has to be based on fact not fiction, but don’t worry it doesn’t have to be something outrageous that will land your name in the gossip magazines.

If you are waiting for the next big idea to hit you on the head, you are going to be greatly disappointed. You have to take a proactive measure in creating buzz about your business.

The Internet enables small business owners to create buzz quickly and inexpensively. With technology you can communicate with, entertain, and educate your customers. When you succeed you create an effective viral marketing campaign that can spread like cyber space fire.

Engage your customers on your site by asking them to respond to a site survey. Such survey engages your customers and it provides your company with quick information. If you don’t have a lot of traffic post your survey to Web sites with significant traffic such as some of the more popular social networking sites.

Whatever method you are utilizing to create buzz around your business, you have to be able to measure it. If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it. Once you have a system in place to measure the effectiveness of your buzz marketing campaign, you can quickly make adjustments to improve its effectiveness.

There are several factors to measure such as the number of new users, email registrants, and time spent on your web site. Don’t just measure once in the beginning of your campaign. Measure religiously and keep measuring. To compare the rest of your site’s performance with your buzz campaign performance, you should create a landing page. The landing page enables you to study the results isolated from the rest of your site.

Wouldn’t it be nice to get the kind of buzz Paris Hilton gets without having to get arrested?
