Article Body:
Neck tie has become a fashion statement not only for them who wear it at their offices or workplace but also those who wear it casually at other functions.  Many a times, when you are out at a lunch meeting you find it hard to manage your neck tie that hangs into your plate or gets dirty with spots such as oil. This really makes you embarrassed before the person to whom you are presenting your professional work. Also when you work or play, it is hard to hold your tie to place it at one place. 

<b> Types of neck tie accessories </b>
The important types of neck accessories include tie bar, tie clip, tie chain, tie tack and tie strap.

<b>  Tie bar </b>
A tie bar is also known as tie slide. It is a thin piece of metal that you slide across middle part of your tie so that it is attached to your shirt. These come in many shapes like simple, creative in the shape of fountain pens and odd shaped. 

<b>  Tie strap  </b>
 A tie strap is a device that keeps your neck tie in its place without restricting its vertical movement. You need to slip it through the label loop on the back of your tie and then button it on your shirt buttons above and below the label loop. It is usually made up of transparent cloth or plastic that makes it invisible with your tie.

<b> Tie clip </b>
 A tie clip is also called as tie clasp and is very similar to tie bar. Unlike tie bar, you need to clip it horizontally across your tie thereby attaching it your shirt.  You can choose from different shapes and material tie clips.

<b> Tie chain </b>
 The upper fixed part of tie chain is a bar that you need to hook to one of your buttons of your dress shirt and then put the neck tie through the loop of the chain such that bar is hidden behind the tie and the chain is visible on the front of the tie. These are made up of silver or gold. 

<b> Tie tack  </b>
 Tie tack is much different from the tie clip and tie bar both in shape and function. A tie tack is made up of two parts; one is the decorative with a pin on the left and back or base along with a chain on the right. You need to remove the pin from the base, then pierce through the cloth of your neck tie, connect the base to the pin and slip the metal weight and chain through button holes of your shirt. It comes in many designs like badges, flags but should be used properly else it can damage your tie.
