I know many people who trade stocks. Most of the US house holds have stocks in various companies. Have you tried options?

Many people think Options are only for professional traders and the big boys. It is not so. Let me explain in simple terms what are the pros and cons of options.

Here is how the option works. Assume that you see a house in your street and the owner is planning to sell it retiring and moving to Florida within one year. The current market price for the house is $215,000. You go and talk to the owner Brad and tell him “Hi Brad; I would like to lock in this house for the price of $220,000; I will have the right to buy this house for this price for one year (i.e. till December 2006). For this I will pay you $2000.”. Now you and Brad come to an agreement; Brad gives you the right but not an obligation to buy the house till December 2006 at a price of 220,000. You have the right and not the obligation that is important which means if the house price goes down you don’t need to buy it at 220K.

Now in end of 2006, the house prices came up and now Brad’s house is now worth $235,000. Now you call a real estate agent sell it for 235,000 and give 220,000 to Brad and pocket a profit of 15,000 (minus your option premium of $1000). So your net profit is $14,000 on an investment of $1000. That is like 1400% return on your money.

If you had bought the house at 215,000 and sell it for 235,000 you might have made 20,000 or about 10% return on your money.
