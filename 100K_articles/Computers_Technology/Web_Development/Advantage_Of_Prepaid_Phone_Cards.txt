In making a call from the streets of Australia to a friend who is drinking coffee in a café located in an avenue in France, one may consider using a prepaid phone card that you can easily get with the help of the world-wide-web. Why go for online prepaid cards, you ask? Let us count the ways.

For one, prepaid online phone cards are way convenient to get. You simply turn on your personal computer, choose from a number of vendors and supplier websites where prepaid phone cards are offered and register in. Make your order and in minutes, you will get an email with the personal identification code or reference number which you can use to load your phone with the credits it needs to make calls. No more driving to the nearby grocer or going to the phone card store to buy one. No dodging with traffic, no expense on fuel cost and there is minimum or less effort on your part. Your fingers basically do the walking so your feet get to rest on their laurels, figuratively speaking.

The convenience of prepaid online phone cards does not stop there. They generally can be used to contact your friends or relatives who may be anywhere in the world. They are flexible enough to accommodate calls not just within your local range but across the seas as well. Being able to hear a friendly hello or a birthday greeting from a special loved one on the other side of the globe may not be impossible and that difficult to obtain with the help of online prepaid phone cards. And you might be surprised to know that international rates are not that high with online prepaid phone cards. Because these online vendors are saving on marketing and other operational costs thru their internet shops, the customers are also able to benefit from their savings. It is noted that with prepaid phone cards, one may be able to avoid the cost of taxes which come with the use of standard telephones in making international calls.

Most people avoid making international calls because they are afraid to look at the high charges that they get billed for at the end of the month or billing period. But with online prepaid phone cards, this nightmare of a scene can now remain within the realms of delusions and hallucinations. This is because there is no such thing as monthly phone bills when it comes to online prepaid phone cards. Since the cards are prepaid, we get to control our phone spending budget and limit our calls to the basic and the important. After each use, we can check the balance of our phone credits and plan on our future calls. With this feature, we can monitor and track our call history as well. There are no contracts for us to sign so we need not worry that we might have neglected to read the fine print that could cause us to pay for other additional charges and fees.
