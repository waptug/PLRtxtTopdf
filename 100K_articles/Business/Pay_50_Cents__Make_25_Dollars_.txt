<b>If you have never heard of affiliate marketing, or you have but you are not doing it, you are missing out on one of the world's greatest opportunities to make enormous amounts of money!</b>  Affiliate marketing is where someone advertises for another website and in return, that person receives commission for each sale their advertising brings to the website.

To get a person to visit their site, you need to have them click through your affiliate link which has your special code in it so the company knows it was you who sent the customer there.  The more people you send, the more chance there is of someone buying a product, obviously.  So it comes down to one question: How do I get people to click on my affiliate link?

The answer is simple.   Pay for them to do so!  There are many Pay Per Click advertising programs on the internet, such as Google Adwords, where you make a little ad, set the amount you're willing to pay for each click (usually between $0.05 - $1.00) and just sit back and watch the sales roll in!

So let's say, for example, you paid $0.50 to send someone to a website and they buy a $50 product, and you earn a 50% commission, then you just made $25 - $0.50 = $24.50!  Now imagine doing this a couple hundred times a day!  <u>All you did was set up a little ad and you watch the profits roll in!</u>

Surely, not every person is going to buy something, but even if 1 in 50 buys, you're still ahead!  Now set this up over and over again, and you could be on your way to earning <b>HUGE</b> amounts of cash every single day for the rest of your life!
