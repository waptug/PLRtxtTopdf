Whether you have wide or narrow feet, you know that finding special sized shoes is difficult. The most difficult type of special shoe to find is one for a wide or large foot. Having large feet does not have to mean you should pay high prices to have custom made shoes. There are a large number of online shoe stores that concentrate on large men and women’s shoes almost exclusively. In addition, a great many of those sites offer the shoes at reasonable prices and are what you might expect to find at a regular shoe store. Both men and women have a hard time finding shoes when they are relegated to hard to find large sizes. There are ways though; that you can get the specialized shoe that will work best for you.

For women, the quest for large shoes can end up with the purchase of large sized men’s shoes just for the sake of comfort. The problem is that when the occasion calls for something beyond casual or athletic wear. If a woman should need to wear a shoe that goes with more formal attire, then she will not have anything that works with her clothes. Wearing men’s shoes may be an easy solution, but it will not serve you well if you are in need of formal women’s shoes.

If you are a woman who wants good looking shoes for all occasions, then try checking out strapless shoes and sandals. These shoes are available in large sizes, but will not cost a lot of money. If you are a man, you may also need large shoes for every occasion whether it is athletics, formal wear, or even slippers. For men, if you contact manufacturers online or via the mail, you will find that many actually do offer the shoe sizes you need. It is just a matter of ordering them, and they are often much less expensive than you may think.

One thing to keep in mind when you order special sized shoes online, whether you are a man or a woman, is that most stores do not stock large amounts as a general rule. Instead, it may happen that you will find larger shoes on backorder. This most often happens when the style is popular or trendy. If you do end up with a backordered pair of special sized shoes, then the website will usually let you know how long you will have to wait.

When it comes to women’s special sized shoes, there are other things to consider, as well. The same size in each style may not fit you every time. For instance, when it comes to wide shoes it is possible that a large shoe with elastic will help you just as much as a specially ordered shoe. If the shoe has narrow toes or a high heel you will likely need to order something a little larger than you are used to. The idea is to make sure you know what is going to be best for your feet with regard to the type of design. 

Keep in mind that if you do have very large or very small feet, that it is no reflection on you as a person. It is easy to complain about your shoe size or to be embarrassed about having to buy specialized shoes, but there is nothing you can do. Instead, concentrate on getting yourself shoes that fit properly so that you can walk in comfort. In addition, shoes that fit your feet correctly will actually help them look normal in size. If you take care of your feet, they will take care of you. 

If you have feet that are either too big or too small, you may feel a little embarrassed in addition to having trouble finding the right shoes. You may have been told or feel like you should have to pay a lot more then you would for regular shoes. The truth is that some places may actually do that by telling you that custom shoes are more expensive. However, if you search online you will find a shoe that fits you and is at a price you can afford. Whether you are a man or a woman, you just need to make sure you are getting a shoe that fits you well so that it is not only comfortable, but also healthy for you and your feet.
