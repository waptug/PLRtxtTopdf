Some scales will give you a comparison rate for other services such as UPS, DHL, and Fed Ex. This is a major benefit that allows your business to save even more money by practicing economical savings.

Postage Meter for your Shipping Supplies

The postage meter differs from your postal scale in the fact that your meter is the part that actually stamps the postage on your mail. A postal scale simply gives you a weight. According to federal law the USPS cannot sell a postage meter - they can only lease one to you.

Your postage meter will save you tremendously on your shipping supplies. Not only can you handle major shipping projects from the comfort of your home office, you can conveniently have all of your business mail professionally stamped with the "metered" mark.

If your business spends more than fifty dollars per month in shipping, then you will most likely benefit from a leased Postage Meter. Your Postage Meter will hold up to $1,000 worth of postage at a time. If you need to order more postage, you can hook your phone line to your meter and download more postage from your USPS store. This saves time in the fact that you won't have to keep running off the store, every time you want to mail a business letter or package.

Digital Postage and Shipping UPS Scales

You can also purchase digital shipping scales that are compatible with UPS. These scales are perfect for both shipping and receiving. A Postage UPS scale is perfect for mailrooms and handling office mail. Again, make sure that your selected scale of choice can handle the weight limits that you need as well as weighs in the form that you require.

Some features that may help influence your choice of UPS scale include, easy digital readouts, ability to connect your UPS scale to a computer, readings in precision increments, shock and overload protected, ability to handle gross weight measurements, and rechargeable batteries.

By using UPS compatible scales, you can rest assured that your business will be able to handle all of its mailroom needs, shipping and packaging needs, as well as handle weights for warehouse operations.
