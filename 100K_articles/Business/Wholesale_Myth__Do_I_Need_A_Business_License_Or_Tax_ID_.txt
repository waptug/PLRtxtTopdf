One of the myths that are still prevailing in the wholesale business is the business license and tax I.D need in order to achieve wholesale success. It is a big mistake to get such an opinion as a fact and then making such message viral all across the Internet.

First of all getting a business license I.D is truly necessary is a true necessary step to make when you plan to incorporate your wholesale or reselling business. In my advance wholesale business opinion, it is important to get a business license if you plan to sell one hundred thousand dollars a month in sales from a retail, wholesale or reselling business. However, there is no need to get a business license when there are many wholesalers and distributors that can cut you deals for wholesale merchandise in single or in bulk amounts legally.

There are different laws that regulate the reselling and wholesale business in many states in the USA, however, that is not an implication that you need a business license to sell wholesale merchandise.

For example: Check out maxamwholesale.com wholesaler, such wholesale giant has been around for decades and they don’t require you to have a business license or tax id in order to resell there wholesale merchandise.

Most of the wholesalers that have a website require you to enter a tax identification number, business license or both. One of the techniques I use to eliminate this kind of hassles to immediately establish a business relationship with them is to call them directly at the phone given in their website.

I then immediately notify the wholesaler that I am highly interest in knowing the wholesale prices of such products they have in their catalog in order to have an instant buying conclusion for making business with them today.

More than 90% of the time they will send you their wholesale catalog through the mail or they will give you a username and password to access the prices in their site for immediate business. Once you have access such site and notify your objective with them, you can start buying directly from the wholesaler or distributor online and by phone without owning a business license or tax identification number.
