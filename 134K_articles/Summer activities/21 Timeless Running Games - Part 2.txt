Timeless Running Games – Part 2

Some running games are best done in teams of four or more children per team.  These are 
great activities for a summer birthday party of if a large group is meeting up at a local 
park.  These games involve all of the children and no one is going to feel left out.

Red Rover is a game made up of two teams with equal numbers on both sides.  The two 
teams face each other in a line holding hands with their team members space about 20 
feet apart.  The first team calls over to the other team, “Red rover, red rover, we call 
child’s name over.”  Once a child’s name is called, they run towards the other team trying 
to break the link of two children holding hands.  If the running child is successful and is 
able to run through he or she gets to return to their team.  If the running child is 
unsuccessful and can’t break through the held hands, they then join that team.  This 
continues back and forth until there is only one team left or a halt is called to the game.

Soccer is always popular and everyone knows the basic rules.  If there are no nets, make 
some with either rocks, natural posts such as trees or use outdoor toys.  The same idea 
can apply to football, don’t worry if you don’t have the right kind of ball anyone will do 
– kids have great imaginations.

Or run just for the sake of running by having a relay race.  You can use sticks as the 
batons or get more creative.  Have the kids say silly word or a joke as the pass-off instead 
of physically passing something back and forth.  Or it can be a getting to know you came, 
each kid has to tell their partner something about themselves for the pass-off.
