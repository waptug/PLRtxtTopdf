Telecommuting is basically web sites that are set up to assist the would be home worker. They have lots of job postings on them. Jobs range from proof reading, freelance writing and reviewers. Telecommuting is basically the job bank for people who wish to work at home and make money online.

But the telecommuter should beware. Some of the jobs can be scams that are geared towards taking money from the unwary. Never pay to get a job. If the job requires that you pay a fee, it is probably a scam. If they want you to work, they will pay you, not the other way around.

There is also no guarantee that you will get paid. The best way to guard against this is to only do a small amount of work before getting your first pay. If the employer values your work, they will pay you to continue. Never do a large amount of work based on promises to get paid.
