Start a Reading Club

Reading is an activity that should occur all year round but it can be made into a fun 
summertime activity too.  If each child doesn’t have their own library card yet, that is a 
good place to start.  While you are there, see if there is any summer reading programs 
available to join.  If there are, great sign-up the kids but if there isn’t start one of your 
own.

Most summer reading programs will focus on getting children to read as many stories as 
they can in a set period of time.  For younger children who can’t read yet, each book that 
is read to them will count as one book towards the final tally.  You may want to break the 
program up into smaller chunks, either two-one month programs or hold one every two 
weeks.

Have the children keep a list of the name of the book they read and the day (or date range 
if it is a chapter book).  You may find that you are taking frequent trips to the library as 
your kids are going through the books, but that is a great thing!  This will teach children 
to be responsible for their library books and the importance of taking care of things that 
do not belong to them.

You can award prizes to the child with the most books read, something small like a 
bookmark or you can take them to a book store to purchase a book that they can keep.  If 
you do decide to give out prizes, consider having small second and third place awards 
too.  Whenever children are showing an interest in reading your want to cultivate and 
encourage it.  Something as simple as a blue ribbon or a certificate printed from the 
computer with their name on it saying they completed the reading contest will be fine.
