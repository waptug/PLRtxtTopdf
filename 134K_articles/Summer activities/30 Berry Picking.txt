Berry Picking

Towards the end of the summer all the different kinds of summer berries will start to 
ripen and be ready for picking.  If you don’t have any bushes or berries in your back yard, 
take a trip to a local berry picking farm and bring home some yummy and nutritious 
snacks.

Most places that you can go berry picking advise you to bring your own bucket.  Each 
child should have a bucket of their own and depending on how many you want bring 
extra buckets too.  Strawberries and blueberries are the most popular pick your own 
businesses.  If you know a place where blackberries or raspberries grow wild (and they 
aren’t on private property) take the family for a walk and pick those too.

When getting dressed to go to a berry patch, don’t wear clothing that you will be upset if 
it gets stained.  It can be hard to bend over the whole time and you are sure to find your 
children sitting on the ground as they pick (and sample) the berries.  Berries will be 
everywhere and it is guaranteed they are going to get berry juice on their clothes.

Once you bring home the fruits of your labor give everything a good wash and decide 
what to do with the berries.  There are many options for eating berries.  If you have 
brought home too many you can freeze a portion in air tight containers or freezer bags.  
Some eating suggestions:

*	Sprinkled on top of an ice cream sundae
*	Added to a morning bowl of cereal
*	On their own with some milk or cream
*	Baked in a pie
*	In a crumble with oatmeal and brown sugar

Berry picking is a fun activity but since it is done outdoors in the summertime, be sure to 
wear hats and put on sunscreen.
