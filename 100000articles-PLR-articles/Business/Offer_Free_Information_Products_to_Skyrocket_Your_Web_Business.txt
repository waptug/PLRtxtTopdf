Article Body:
If you've worked on the Internet for any length of time, then you probably realize how important it is for websites to offer valuable information. Many companies offer free information products to grab a targeted audience. There's no doubt that Web surfers are seeking information, and the Internet is often called "The Information Highway." So, what's the key to success for your Web business? Offering valuable information about your niche market!

Why Offering Free Information is So Important

There are several reasons why offering free information is important to your online business. 

One, it gives your visitor a reason to fill out their name and email address and sign on for your mailing list. The more subscribers you gain, the more opportunity you will have to sell your products. Many consumers buy only after being contacted several times; it builds trust for your online visitors. Promise to give your new subscribers a free information product such as a free e-book download. Your profits will grow as your mailing list grows - and you'll improve cashflow for your business as well.

Two, you can increase profits by adding content within the free information product. When you compile a free e-book for your visitors, you can include anything you want in the e-book. You can offer other products that pertain to your website. Your visitors are already interested or they wouldn't be reading the e-book!

Three, you can establish a solid reputation with visitors. Offering free information products helps you build a good name on the Web. You can even allow other websites to offer your free e-book to their clients. This helps you build a name for yourself on the Web while eliminating the risk in the minds of your potential clients.

Of course, there are many other benefits such as search engine optimization, multiple streams of income, etc.

Types of E-books

E-books can be about any subject - gardening, cooking, Web design, graphic design, writing, insurance, car buying, mortgages, finance, home business, office tips, computer tips, etc. Choose a topic that you enjoy so your business won't become a dreaded task. Find a niche in that field and offer free information about that niche product or service.

How to Offer Free Information Products

There are three prominent ways to offer free information products. One, write an e-book yourself. Two, hire someone to write it for you. Three, find public domain information that you can sell for profits or offer to your visitors free.

Public domain information can be books, articles, brochures, government information, magazines, etc. that are available for anyone to use, sell, or offer for free. This means the copyright has expired or never existed. There are even public domain packages you can purchase that contain many public domain products. Anything that's "public domain" can be turned into a free e-book download for your clients. It's a business opportunity that many online business owners don't realize exists. 

There are endless books that are labeled public domain. Just be sure they are actually "public domain" before using them. With this little known secret, you can turn your free information products into profits in no time.
