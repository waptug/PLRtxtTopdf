When you go to a hobby store that is specializing in RC cars, one purchase could cause a grave dent in your pocket. This is because most hobby stores are of a professional grade. The hobby RC cars they are selling are designed to perform like the real thing – real cars, trucks, boats and airplanes.

Some of the hobby-grade RC cars are unassembled while others come in partially assembled RC car kit. However, if you want to break free from the hassle of assembly or if you know nothing about the thing, never dare to do it by yourself. Instead, you can opt for an assembled version of the RC car. They are offered by RC car shops. Remember that it is better to let the experts do the assembly for you rather that having it your way and destroy your precious RC car.

If you want your kids to enjoy the adrenaline rush of RC's, you can purchase RC toy cars for them. The latter are designed for children and amateurs alike.
