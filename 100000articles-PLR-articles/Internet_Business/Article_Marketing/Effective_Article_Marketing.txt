To be an effective article marketer is to give your audience what they want. Also, remember that all your readers are the Very Important Persons (VIP) in the web. Some web articles are read but, regrettably, most are not. 

Since the internet is the one that seems to rule the world in development and advances in businesses, e- business is the article marketing. 
Today, businesses are turning to the internet to conduct their business.  If a novelist needs inspiration and research in order to achieve things, he searches for related articles.

And people, being critical, have the tendency to judge your whole site just by reading one of your articles. So write good quality articles for your audience. This will serve as the link between you and your potential clients. Just like your website, articles must be considered to be your alter-ego.

The most effective and suggested way to write an article is easy, as long as you know the basics.
It is important that you research what are peoples questions and then write articles answering their queries.

Make it as interesting as possible, for it will serve as the link between you and your site, and to submit it to free articles posting sites and the rest is history. Just remember that when your article is more of promotion rather than giving information, it will certainly be rejected at article directories.
Never write about something that is too difficult to follow. Write articles that serves other poeple's interests rather than your own.

Make your reader believe that you know what you are writing about. It will determine how much traffic your article will get back to your site and the resource box will make it possible for many people who would get to read your article, to  visit your site and get to know more about you.
