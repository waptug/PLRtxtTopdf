Most don’t even know what medical transcription is, but it’s very simple. When doctors see patients they must take notes and update charts. Many have too many patients to see and they simply do not have the time to write everything down and update the charts. This is a huge problem for those working in the emergency room, as they really have to hustle between patients. Many times, those doctors talk into a microphone and then someone else has to type out and enter the information by listening to the tape. That is what medical transcription is all about.

If you want to work in medical transcription, you have to be a fast and accurate typist, but there is much more to it. You also have to understand medical terms of all kinds. If you don’t know much about anatomy, you will have to learn everything a doctor knows about the parts and pieces of the human body. Otherwise, you will not understand anything you hear when listening to doctors tapes. You also have to know much more, and you learn all of that when you take a course in medical transcription.

As with medical coding and billing, you can usually find many great medical transcription courses online. You may not be able to do all of the courses from home, but you can complete some of them this way. You can learn at your own pace this way, and you can save money by not having to travel. The extra expenses that go along with attending class can add up, and you can avoid some of those when you choose to study medical transcription from the comfort of your own home. Make sure the program you choose is legit, and then go ahead and see what various places have to offer. These courses should move rather fast, but it will depend on how much time you can put into your studies each week.
