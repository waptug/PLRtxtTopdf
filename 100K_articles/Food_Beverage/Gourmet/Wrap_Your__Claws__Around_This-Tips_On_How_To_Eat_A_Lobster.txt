For the ultimate seafood experience, it's tough to top the sweet flavor of a tender lobster. 

Here are some succulent suggestions from the experts at Red Lobster on easy ways to crack and eat this delectable dish. 

Step 1: Where to begin? The claws, with meat that is tender and flavorful, are generally the best place to start. After removing the two front claws, use a nutcracker to crack them open and a lobster fork to remove the meat.

Step 2: The tail meat is considered the sweetest part of the lobster. Turn the lobster on its back, holding the body with one hand and the tail with the other. Gently twist the tail to detach it. Remove the end flippers. Using a fork, you can then pull out the juicy meat.

Step 3: There's plenty of meat in the body of the lobster. Flip it over and unhinge the back by cracking it apart lengthwise and pull out the tasty meat with a pick. The greenish-gray tomalley in the body cavity is considered a delicacy (the sand sac near the top of the lobster is not edible, though).

Step 4: The last step is enjoying the meat in the legs. The meat here is delicious and can be sucked out like a straw.

Whether you enjoy lobster "as is" or prefer dipping it into melted butter or a savory sauce, this deep-sea delight can be a dining experience like no other. Plus, it's a low-calorie, low-fat source of protein: 3.5 ounces of lobster meat has only about 96 calories and less than 2 grams of fat, according to the seafood specialists. 

Succulent and good for you-how many foods can you say that about?
