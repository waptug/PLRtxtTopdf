Over a decade ago, the fist print/apply label applicators were introduced.  These products were designed to handle both the printing and application of pressure sensitive labels at the same time.  Touted as an “all in one” solution, the print/apply machines entered the marketplace slowly.

Today, print/apply label applicator solutions are becoming more commonplace.  Improvements in technology and efficiency have spurred increased use of these applicators.  Is a print/apply label applicator right for you?

The answer to that question will be based on a few considerations.  First, print/apply technology is perfect for those who will be using the same conveyor to process a number of different products in smaller lots.  New print/apply technology allows the label applicator to “see” the object and to then make a determination of which label to apply.  This means one can avoid having to reload their applicator each time a different product is processed.  It also eliminates the need to maintain several different label types, as one basic label can be printed in a number of different ways, as necessary.

If that kind of flexibility sounds attractive, you may also want to consider some of the other benefits of print/apply applicators.  They can help to decrease overall labor costs, as they combine what have traditionally been two different aspects of processing into one step. 

If you are currently using a traditional label applicator, you may be less than thrilled with its accuracy in label placement.  New print/apply equipment, outfitted with “smart technology” boasts very accurate placement and can consistently apply labels to designated areas--even on irregularly-shaped items.

Retooling the labeling system on your line may seem like an expensive and time-consuming endeavor.  However, many print/apply users believe the machines compensate for the initial cost and inconveniences quickly via improved quality and efficiency.
