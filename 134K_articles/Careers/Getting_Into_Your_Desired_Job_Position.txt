Article Body:
When we look for a job, we wanted to be working in the field we specialize or plainly have an interest with so we can utilize our knowledge and talent. Some of us successfully got what they want while others looked for different fieldwork due to different circumstances. 

In these days, it is hard to look for a job. Employers look for an edge that makes you different from the rest. Moreover, the edge that employers look for is experience. When applying for a job that you desire you must at least have the experience or have knowledge on the position you are applying. However, when an employer sees that you have the potential, they will provide a free training for the position we applied.

How employers knew who would fit for the position? The answer really depends on us applicants’ performance during the application. When we pass our resume either online or walk-in, the employer must get a good impression from the resume that we submitted. What we wrote in the resume is what exactly we can offer to the company, so be careful not to be too arrogant in making a resume, be precise, limit yourself on what you know. Never put anything in the resume that we actually do not know.

When an employer likes what he sees in your resume immediately he will ask for an interview, now during the interview it is ok to be confident but not too much. Just be yourself, if you do not know the answer to his question just politely say you do not have any idea. Just make it a point that the employer sees in you the interest in the position you are applying, and it is enough for the employer to hire you.
     
From the job given to you, we must learn from it, not just work it. Learn how to enrich your knowledge. Never stop, always aim higher, take it gradually to the position you really wanted to achieve.
