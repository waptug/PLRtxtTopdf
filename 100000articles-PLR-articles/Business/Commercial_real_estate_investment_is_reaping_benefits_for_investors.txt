Why invest in commercial property?
Unlike residential real estate, Commercial real estate investment is evaluated, bought, and sold based purely on numbers - on a set of factors that describe what kind of return on investment you can expect with the property. Most Commercial real estate investment is expected to make a return for you on an on-going (monthly) basis. With the retail boom and increasing return on investment in the commercial real estate market, the value of commercial real estate have grown by leaps and bounds, particularly, in the commercial areas, where the local retail shops and shopping complexes have been replaced by huge and swanky malls. 
What to expect?
Remember though! Commercial real estate investment is a long term opportunity, do not expect to increase you net worth over night. No one is going to profit all the time. Real estate investors have to suffer through times of little to no cash flow - it is part of the game. 
This may cause panic but if you can stick with it for the long term, cash flow will increase. Investing especially in real estate is not for the weak of mind or body. It can be frustrating, and stressful. But for successful investors the rewards are priceless.
