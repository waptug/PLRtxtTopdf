Stop the whines and moans by giving the kids some great things to do while you enjoy adult conversation and have fun watching the kids play. Here are some great BBQ ideas that are kid-friendly.

1. Place a big basket of outdoor toys that are age related outside near the BBQ area. This will help keep your children occupied so that they will also be having a great time.

You can choose toys like dump trucks, little cars, shovels, or other things that your kids will enjoy.

2. Encourage your friends or family to bring their children. The kids will love getting a chance to play together while the adults converse.

It is also a great excuse to get the extended family together to let the cousins play with each other.

3. Set up the sprinkler a good ways from the BBQ area, but still in sight. Let the kids put on their swimsuits and splash around in the water.

This is a great thing for a summer day, and one of the greatest kid-friendly BBQ ideas. If the weather is not warm enough, you may want to skip this little idea.

4. By adding some soft plastic on the ground, your kids can run and slip and slide across the plastic. You can use a commercial one if you want, but it's just as easy to make on out of house plastic or a very soft tarp.
