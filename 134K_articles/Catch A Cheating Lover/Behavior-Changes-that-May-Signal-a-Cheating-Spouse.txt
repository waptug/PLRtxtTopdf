Behavior Changes that May Signal a Cheating Spouse

Do you think that your spouse is having an affair?  Many times, it can be very difficult to tell if your spouse is cheating on you.  Fortunately, many cheating spouses eventually show signs of being unfaithful, most of which are associated with their behavior. Outlined below are some signs that your spouse might be cheating on you.

Your spouse joins a gym.  This is a major sign when it is something that they never had any interest in doing so before.  If you never had a problem with your spouse’s weight before, why would you now?  This could be a sign that they are trying to impress someone besides you.

Your spouse does not have time to sit down and talk anymore.  Did and your spouse talk about their day?  If you never seem to have the deep or intense conversations that you once had, there may be a major problem.  Cheating spouses often try to distance themselves from their relationships at home.  This is a sign that your spouse may be cheating on you.

Your spouse may act differently during sex and want to try new things out in the bedroom.  If your spouse suddenly wants to try new things in the bedroom or if you just notice that the sex is different, they may be cheating.  In fact, you may be left wondering where they learned that from. 

In keeping with sex, your spouse may want to have it less.  A decrease in sex frequency is a sign that your spouse may be cheating on you.  As for why sex occurs less when cheating is involved, they feel guilty about what they are doing or they may be getting enough sex already.

They may also get angry easier and more often.  Your spouse may also be touchy around you.  This may lead to more arguments and disagreements in your relationship. Things you do may annoy your husband or wife.  They may actually go as far as to leave the room.   Be sure to observe the changes in behavior that your spouse has towards other members of your family as well.

They want to buy a whole new wardrobe, in a way, reinventing themselves.  This works in conjunction with joining a gym to lose weight.  A huge sign of cheating is when a new wardrobe is purchased and when more skin is being shown.

Unusual behavior when your spouse is on the phone is another sign of cheating.  When they are talking on the phone near you, do they try to lower their voce or even leave the room?  Hanging up a phone quickly is another signal to watch for.  Be cautious of increased cell phone use, as many cheaters prefer to use their own personal phones, as opposed to family phones.

In addition to examining the behavior of your husband or wife, the behavior of your friends should also be examined.  The friends you share together may start acting differently towards you.  This is often because your shared friends might know more than you do.  Even if a friend does not outright tell you that your husband or wife is cheating, they may intentionally or unintentionally show you the signs.

These above mentioned signs may be an indicator that your spouse is cheating on you, but there may also be reasonable causes for these behavior changes.  For example, your spouse might want to look great for you and you alone, or they also may simply want to improve their health.

Since there are no guarantees that cheating could be going on, even with the above mentioned signs present, additional steps should be taken.  These steps can and should include monitoring cell phone calls, viewing the cell phone bill, or hiring a private investigator.  Never confront your husband or wife without the proper proof.  Be sure to get solid evidence of cheating, otherwise you could be creating a whole new problem in your relationship.
