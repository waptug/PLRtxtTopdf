Article Body:
Malmo is the capital of the province of Skane in southwestern Sweden. In the 16th century it was a major fishing port, competing with Copenhagen as Scandinavia`s most influential city. Today the city is well-known for its busy harbor, as well as for its rich architectural heritage.

The imposing 16th-century Malmohus was built by the Danish king Christian ²²², when Skane formed part of Denmark. It contains the Malmomuseer (Malmo Museums), which include the Art Museum, the Museum of Natural History, the City Museum, the Science & Technology and Maritime Museum, and the Kommendants Hus (Commander`s House).

The Dutch Renaissance style is evident in Malmo`s impressive Radhuset (Town Hall), which dates from 1546 and dominates the city`s main square, Stortorget. Northeast of here is the 14th-century St. Petri`s Kyrks, built in the Baltic Gothic style. The Church`s most beautiful features include the altarpiece (1611), Scandinavia`s largest, and a wonderfully ornate pulpit. Admit the city`s maze of pedestrianized streets, lined with shops and cafes, is Lilla Torg (Little Square), with its cobblestones and charmingly restored houses. The square has a lively atmosphere and draws crowds of tourists and locals alike, especially in fine weather. At the northwest corner of the square, the bustling Saluhallen is a covered market, with many restaurants, cafes, and specialist food stores. Heading east from Lilla Torg brings you to the Rooseum. This excellent museum of modern art was founded in 1988 by the Swedish art collector and Financier Fredric Roos. Retrospectives of a number of leading international contemporary artists are held here regularly.
