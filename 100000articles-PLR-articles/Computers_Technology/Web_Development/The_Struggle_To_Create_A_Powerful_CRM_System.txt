Almost every business owner is aware of the importance of an effective customer relationship management system in the modern marketplace. But still there is a struggle to create a powerful CRM system that works and is affordable.

Marketing departments fully understand how important a good CRM system is and that is must include pertinent customer information such as email, phone, and web info. Sales departments also fully understand the importance of quality CRM software to build a strong customer database.

However the message of how important a CRM system that unifies all departments seems to get lost. You would assume that CRM experts or IT personal would be quick to point this out however many don’t assuming that the business owner knows this.

You might be surprised at just how many poor CRM software choices are made because business owners either don’t understand what it is that is needed for a successful CRM system or are trying to keep costs down.

Surprisingly it is common for the companies that can most afford it to spend a great deal of money on their CRM software systems. For example recently I had some dealings with a nation wide cellular company that had been promoting several packages and bonuses to encourage. My first bill arrives about 45 days after I had signed up and to my surprise I had not received the promised free minutes and activation.

When I called no one at the company was familiar with the discount package that I had been offered in an effort to steal clients from another cell provider. Because of their very poor CRM system not only did not all staff know what packages had been offered they also didn’t know which customers had taken those offers.

This is a company that makes over a billion dollars in sales every year and they are running a pathetic example of a CRM yet they could afford the very best which would be beneficial to customer and staff. This scenario isn’t that unusual.

Customer Relationship Management Software is a powerful tool that offers all kinds of tools. Costs can range from just a couple of dollars to thousands of dollars. And although you might be a bit shy about the initial costs the long term benefits and increased profits are certainly something to talk about.

If there’s a lesson to be learned here, it’s that the larger companies have a lot to learn and that the smaller companies are much quicker to react to market demands and invest in products that will improve customer service, keep adequate potential customer and existing customer records, and to provide information to help their business grow and prosper, and increase profits.

Your CRM software should provide all departments with the information they need. Sales departments will want history of sales and inquiries as well as solutions. Marketing departments will be interested in the type of products that are selling and how much of each product. Accounting departments will be interested in profits and in accounts receivables. And management will be interested in seeing everything about their company.

Although there is a bit of a struggle to create a powerful CRM system that’s affordable and provides the needed business tools and information. The right CRM software is the most powerful tool your business can have in this modern day era.
