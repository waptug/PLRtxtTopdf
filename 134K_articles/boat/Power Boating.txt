Power Boating


Power boating is becoming a rapidly growing sport all around the world.  While many people think of a power boat as simply a really fast speed boat, the reality is that a power boat is so much more.  It is a high performance machine capable of very fast speeds and is usually used in racing competitions.

The sport of power boating requires the use of a highly tuned boat that is capable of high planing or skimming the water.  This allows for higher rates of speed and easier handling.  That’s why power boats are used in racing competitions.

There are all sorts of power boats that are used in power boating.  In fact, there are over fifty-three categories of power boats and within each category there are many, many makes and models.  Following are some of the more common power boats:

* Bow rider
* Power catamaran
* Classic or antique replica
* Deck boat
* Express cruiser
* Hovercraft
* Jet boat
* Runabout

The type of engine you have on your power boat is a very important consideration.  Because these boats are meant to travel at high speeds, you will want an engine that will complement your performance boat.  Make sure the horsepower is high enough that you will be able to get as much power out of your boat as possible.

Now many people still do use power boats for recreational activities like skiing and wakeboarding.  Just be sure that when you are towing someone behind your boat, you aren’t going too fast that they will lose control and risk injury.

You could really consider power boating as the operation of any craft that derives its power from an engine as opposed to human power.  But real power boating and racing boats go hand-in-hand.  If you’ve ever seen a power boat race, you know that these machines are finely tuned crafts capable of amazing handling as they skim effortlessly across the water.

When you are captaining a power boat, you need to be fully aware of the capabilities of your craft.  Operate the boat safely and keep a good eye on the other boaters around you as well as any natural barriers or aspects of the body of water you are on.  It’s very easy to have an accident when piloting a power boat, so take boating safety seriously when at the helm.

Power boating is a great sport that can give even the most experienced boater a thrill.  Take up power boating and learn what boating is really supposed to be about!
