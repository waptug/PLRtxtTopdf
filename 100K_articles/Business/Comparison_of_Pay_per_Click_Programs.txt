<b>Google Adsense</b>
If you dont know what Google AdSense is then youve been living under a rock. 
This is pretty much a must have if you want to make money from a blog. Google 
display simple text and image ads on your blog that are targeted to what youre 
writing about. Google has been a consistent money maker for this blog.

<b>TTZ Media Network</b>
This is my own ad network. Its ideal for technology and shopping related sites. 
TTZ Media provides product based ads that are trigger by keywords. The ads show 
products that are based on the keywords entered and a list of online stores 
where the products can be purchased. A reader clicking on the product will be 
taken to the store offering the product for sale. Money is generated with a CPC 
model. A reader need only click on the banner and visit the advertiser in order 
for the site to make money. The reader does not have to purchase the product 
from the advertiser. CPC rates are based on product categories and number of 
clicks the affiliate can generate. Our tech/review site based affiliates realize 
eCPM as high as $12.

<b>Pepperjam Network</b>
Founded by my friend Kris Jones, Pepperjam Network represents an evolution 
in affiliate marketing. The creation of Pepperjam Network represents eight years 
of research and development and the combined ideas, feedback, and intelligence 
of hundreds of affiliate marketers and advertisers. Pepperjam Network offers a

<b>Kontera ContentLink</b>
Kontera ContentLink allows you to make money from advertising without giving up 
any current advertising spots. Their technology reads your post and turns 
certain words into an ad. The highlighted words are double underline and an ad 
pops up when you hover over it. Normally Kontera requires a site have a minimum 
500,000 page views per month before being accepted into the program. However, I 
have a partnership with Kontera that will allow smaller blogs to use their 
ContentLink service.

<b>Text Link Ads</b>
Text Link Ads is one of my favorite ad networks. They help me make money online 
by selling those text links you see under Featured Sites. The links offer 
advertisers traffic and search engine benefits and readers dont seem to mind 
them at all because they are not intrusive. Your link price is set by Text Link 
Ads and is based on Alexa, Google PageRank, number of RSS subscribers, and other 
factors.

<b>Bidvertiser</b>
Bidvertiser, a CPC ad network that competes with Google AdSense. It main 
advantage over AdSense is its low $10 payout. You only need to make $10 in order 
to be paid. Big publishers wouldnt care about this but for many small blogs 
that are still waiting to hit that magic $100 Google payout level, getting pay 
at a lower level is quite attractive.

<b>AzoogleAds</b>
AzoogleAds is one of the largest performance-based online advertising networks 
in the world. They offers some of the best and highest paying affiliate deals in 
the industry. No matter what topic your blog covers, you can find a deal that 
matches your site. The payout range from $1 to over $100 per action. Affiliate 
marketing is one of this blogs biggest moneymaker and AzoogleAds is the 
affiliate network that offers us the best payouts.

<b>AuctionAds</b>
AuctionAds is one big eBay affiliate. What AuctionAds does is put all their 
publishers into one big collective to go after the higher revenue share. 
Publishers can leverage AuctionAds creative delivery of eBays auctions and 
AuctionAds ability to achieve the higher performance incentive tiers with the 
aggregate volume of traffic to make more money than they could with their own 
eBay affiliate relationship. Right now, affiliates will get 100% of any money 
they make from the system. As the collective moves up the eBay revenue share 
tiers, AuctionAds will start to take a cut of revenues. The goal is for you to 
make more with AuctionAds than directly with eBays affiliate program, which 
will be the case as the network increases its volume.

<b>ReviewMe</b>
ReviewMe is this biggest money maker, accounting for $2,400 of the 
$8,545.25 March income. ReviewMe allows advertisers to buy sponsored reviews on 
your blog. Review prices are based on your blogs Alexa, Technorati and 
estimated RSS numbers. Publishers can set their own pricing if they dont like 
the price ReviewMe set. Reviews can be positive or negative. The only 
requirement is the post must be at least 200 words long.

<b>DealDotCom</b>
DealDotCom offers a two-tier affiliate program. When you refer others to 
DealDotCom and they get a free account, they are marked in the system as having 
been referred by you. Anything that they buy will nets you a 35% commission. 
Unlike other affiliate programs that place a time limit your your commission 
(like AuctionAds 5% for 6 months), the DealDotCom commission is forever. Thats 
right, forever. It doesnt matter if they buy something tomorrow, next week, or 
fifty years from now - you are going to get paid. Whats more, anyone that they 
refer to DealDotCom goes on your second tier. Anything people on your second 
tier buy nets you a 15% commission, forever.
