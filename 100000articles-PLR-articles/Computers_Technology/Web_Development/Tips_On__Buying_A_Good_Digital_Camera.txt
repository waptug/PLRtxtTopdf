One of the top selling items on the market today is the digital camera. People enjoy taking pictures when on a trip or vacation, at sporting events, when the flowers are in bloom and just about any other occasion that may arise. Countless teens are taking pictures at the most random events in order to put them on their “myspace” page. Pictures capture moments and preserve memories. With a digital camera you are able to save these photos on your computer and print them at your convenience. Instead of wasting a roll of film that you used to use in a regular camera, you are able photograph as many things as you want and delete the bad shots and save only the best digital images. So the real question is; which digital camera is the best to buy?

There are so many digital cameras on the market today it can be very difficult to make a decision. If you go to any store with an electronics department or if you are looking online, you are bound to see a whole line up of different digital cameras promising the best product with highest quality photos. It is helpful if you have a friend who is knowledgeable about digital cameras. They can possibly steer you in the right direction.

If you are not lucky enough to have such a friend, I have listed a few key things to look for when shopping for a digital camera. One of the first things to look for in a digital camera is the amount of mega pixels. The higher the mega pixel the digital camera has the better photo quality you will receive. This means that when you try and enlarge the picture, the resolution of the photo is going to be better or possibly worse depending on the different mega pixel levels. If you have a one mega pixel camera, when enlarging your photo, the quality is going to quickly deteriorate. The opposite will occur with your digital photos when you have a seven mega pixel digital camera. Another thing to look for when selecting a digital camera is the LCD screen. The better digital cameras will provide a LCD screen so you can frame your picture easier. Try to find a camera with a LCD screen about 2.5 inches or larger for maximum results. Also notice the zoom strength when you are researching digital cameras. The best digital cameras will provide up to a 10x digital zoom for your all your close-ups.

It is not always necessary to spend a lot of money. Keep your eyes open for the sales. We were able to purchase a very high quality digital camera with 7.5 mega pixels on sale and have been very satisfied with our photos.

Taking pictures with a digital camera is a great way to capture moments that will stay with you forever. It is important to purchase a high quality digital camera in order to save these precious moments. There is a variety of digital cameras available on the market, so do your research before choosing the one for you.
