When planning a trip why not consider a Cruise vacation.  Having sailed on Celebrity Cruise Lines after reading many cruise reviews, I can highly recommend Celebrity Cruises for a great cruise vacation.

Scuba diving? Exotic cuisines?  Going to a spa? Different activities for a vacation you can choose from, but why not do all of them on a Celebrity Cruise vacation.

A Celebrity Cruise is a cost and time efficient vacation. You won't have to go to different destinations to enjoy the above activities. On a Celebrity Cruise vacation all the amenities you want, fitness center, restaurants, swimming pools, casino and gourmet food can be found on a Celebrity cruise vacation.

You do not have to worry about your luggage.  You drop if off at the pier and it will be delivered to your stateroom.  Unpack once and you're done for the duration of your cruise vacation. After you have unpacked go to lunch, one of the best cruising activities is the parade of delicious dishes in Celebrity Cruise dining rooms.

 Each Celebrity Cruise vacation has its own restaurant administered by the finest chefs in the world. Best of all, every meal and snack are included in your Celebrity Cruise package.

All cruise lines offers these services to their passengers, however Celebrity Cruise Lines does it just a little bit better. Celebrity Cruise Line is one of the best cruise lines available in today's market. They offer competitive packages and are just one step above other cruise lines. They have onboard upscale boutiques and entertainment ala Las Vegas, which was created and designed exclusively for Celebrity Cruise Lines by Cirque du Soleil.

You can try your luck at the Casino or even purchase some fine art at the onboard auction. Late in the evening check out The Bar at the Edge of the Earth, an exotic lounge provided exclusively by Celebrity Cruise Lines.

If you feel the need to relax, visit the famous Aqua-Spa by Elemis. There, you will experience a deluxe manicure, facial treatments, and a relaxing massage. Celebrity Cruise Lines also has onboard acupuncture center if you want to feel renewed and invigorated.  You can book spa packages before you go on your cruise vacation over the internet

Your kids will also enjoy their cruise vacation on a Celebrity Cruise vacation. Celebrity offers the X-Club Youth Program exclusively for your kids. It has activities and entertainment for specific age groups. 

A professional staff administers all of these activities, which include science and nature exploration, treasure hunts, talents shows, dinner parties, and more. Celebrity Cruises have reserved areas on the ship for younger seafaring passengers such as the Shipmates Fun Factory, teen center, and pools. This allows your kids enjoy their own activities while you are off enjoying yours.

Celebrity Cruise Lines has designed its ships to accommodate mobility-impaired passengers. There are staff members that are always ready to attend to any of their special needs. Celebrity has an onboard clinic staffed by a licensed doctor and nurse who can speak foreign languages 

Food on a cruise vacation is available 24/7 in cafeterias and dining areas. You can also request room service if you want to have a romantic dinner with your spouse. We did this while we did a European cruise and the dinner came with a white linen table cloth, china, silver and crystal glasses. It was really beautiful and I have never experienced that on other cruise lines.  There are formal dinners in the famous Celebrity Cruise Lines dining rooms two or three times during the cruise vacation, depending on the length of your cruise travel. If you do not wish to participate in this cruise activity there are casual restaurants that you can visit instead.

Celebrity Cruise Lines has a variety of itineraries from which to choose.  Some of them our very exotic like the Galapagos or Australia.  No matter which itinerary you choose you will always feel pampered on a Celebrity Cruise vacation.  Celebrity Cruise Lines staff always go the extra mile to please you.  Read some other cruise reviews and see if they don't agree with me.

Enjoy cruising with Celebrity Cruise Lines!
