The aftershave colognes came in both liquid that you can splash on your face or in the spray bottle.

The pricing of the Boss Cologne product lines varied.  There were some at the low end of the price spectrum for thrifty shoppers that want a name brand at an affordable price. There were additional product lines at the higher end of the price spectrum as well.

Some online shops offer very low product prices and make up the cost difference with extremely high shipping and handling fee charges.
