Then they will ask you for the requisite debt that is required. Depending upon the relationship that you enjoy with your bank, you can get the amount required. You may also get 80% or 90% of the amount. In case you approach organizations, which specialize in helping, you pay back your debts; they may also charge a certain commission dependent upon the value of your cumulative debts. In most cases banks will ask for a security or collateral against which they would give you a loan. For debt help, these can range from your immovable property such as house and business property to movable such as your car etc. 

Banks always would like to make their investment safe while at the same time giving you debt help. In the event that you are unable to pay them back the principal amount, they will have rights to your property. In most cases however, the banks will structure a loan whereby it will become easier to pay the interest as well as the principal without affecting you further. There are many non-profit organizations, which are willing to assist you in paying back the loans. In this way they can also be categorized as loan helpers.
