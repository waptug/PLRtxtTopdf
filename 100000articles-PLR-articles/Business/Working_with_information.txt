Who can encounter such difficulties? 
First of all, people who need to carry a lot of data with them. For example, travelers, who cannot do without their favorite movies and music and don’t want to carry a lot of discs. Businessmen who spend a lot of time in business trips need to have a lot of information close at a hand to succeed in negotiations or presentations.

Sometimes you have to make urgent changes in a huge report or presentation and send it to your boss immediately. Or, being a member or a fan of some sports team, which played some out match, you want the video from the game to appear in the video section of you home University news as soon as possible. The only appropriate decision is to upload your file and send a link. It saves a lot of time. People don’t have to wait till your arrival.
