Gambling is an activity that seems to work well in keeping the mind young in many people around the world. There are many people in their 80's that have been playing in a regular poker game for years. Not only is poker a game that requires the use of several parts of the brain it is also a social experience. While you are playing you are also talking and joking around with the other players, which also keeps those different parts of the brain well lubricated.

Blackjack is another card game that is good for the brain. Blackjack requires the use of short term memory. Exercising this part of the brain is very important in the fight to stave off senility. Most people think there is nothing to blackjack except trying to get a hand as close to 21 as possible, but there is much more to it then that. Players need to know how each card affects their hand and the dealer's hand. If you have ever sat at a blackjack table in a casino you will see its not really about getting the best hand its all about trying to get the dealer to bust, and this takes a good knowledge of the odds and memorization.

Where as a game of skill will exercise the brain and help keep the mind working most games of luck will not have the opposite effect, you do not start becoming senile faster because of the game you play, but a game that requires skill to be good at the game will slow the process and keep you feeling young will into your golden years.

But not all games are good for the mind. Some casino games can actually have the reverse effect. Playing the slots will not speed up the slowing down of your brain, but it does nothing to stop or reverse the effects of old age. Games like slot machines and roulette are games of luck with no real skill involved. Games like this have no beneficial traits for keeping a strong and healthy brain.

Gambling is not the only thing that can help. Anything that forces you to do some thinking and concentration is healthy for your mind. Believe me exercise your mind and it will stay young longer.
