Wedding etiquette for groom’s parents during the wedding<br><br>

The father of the groom’s responsibilities during weddings are often overlooked. It is because they are just always tasked to escorting the mother of the groom, and that role is still conditional if they are in good relations---that is, they are not divorced.<br><br>

The groom’s mother can be busier. Women are very particular to dresses and that is where the groom’s mom should first strike.<br><br>

The groom’s mom should leave the role of dealing for the bride’s dress to the bride’s mom. She should also not mind the dresses for the maid of honor or bridesmaids. The groom’s mom should only compliment the gowns to be worn by the bride’s mom and bridesmaids, not overdo or outdo them.<br><br>

The groom’s parents are expected to follow customs and traditions during wedding ceremonies. They will be led by ushers as where they should be seated in the wedding venue.<br><br>

Other important roles for the groom’s parents<br><br>

It can be funny, but in the Western or modern culture, the groom’s parents are mainly involved just in funding or shouldering wedding-related bills.<br><br>

Among the other things the groom’s parents should pay for are the bride’s wedding ring, the clergy fees in the church, transportation expenses of groom’s men, gifts or tokens for groom’s men as well as lodging costs if necessary, gift for the bride and the bouquets, boutonnieres and corsages.<br><br>

Wedding ceremonies are just that---ceremonies. The marriage will not principally depend on the wedding, but a good one will make a good start for the couple. The groom’s parents should be as supportive as ever for their beloved son is embarking on a new life.
