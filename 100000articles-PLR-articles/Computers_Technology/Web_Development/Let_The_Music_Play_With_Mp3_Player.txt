Music is the ultimate source of entertainment for many people in the world. It is one of the most effective sources of refreshing and de-stressing oneself, when one is burdened with stress and anxiety. It has always been on top of people`s popular priorities, to listen to music as a regular part of their lives.

The invention of gadgets like Mp3 player and iPod has now enabled them to listen to their favorite music, even when they are on the move. This very fact has largely contributed to the growing popularity of the Mp3 player devices among many people across the globe.

Nowadays, Mp3 player manufactures are coming up with the different types of designs to suit the varied needs of all customers. Customers these days have become more prudent than ever before and now they want to choose gadgets that are multi-purpose in use. For instance, there are sunglasses with Mp3 player devices, Mp3 player with GPS (global tracking system) and many other useful combinations. These combined devices not only help users to save their budgets but also offer them comfort of using or carrying them. On the other hand, the manufactures are also able to introduce their products to customers with different features which, in turn, establish their credibility in the market as well. Hence, the whole market of music-oriented gadgets and devices are just growing day by day.

Depending on their functions, Mp3 player gadgets can serve a wide-range of purposes. A recently held study shows that an average teenager spends about U$350 a year on consumer electronic devices, whereas that of an adult sums up to U$1,200. Usually, customers have different buying behaviors and they take different features into account while they buy audio devices. For example, some people want to listen to music while they are working out on the treadmill, and some people want to amuse themselves by listening to their favorite tracks while commuting on public transport. Due to this difference in the life-style of people, manufactures are coming up with Mp3 player devices of different shapes, sizes, styles and storage features.

Since almost all the Mp3 player manufacturers are offering devices with the same features, making their products stand out from the rest is becoming an issue with them. Hence, now they are launching their products in different sleek designs and sizes to attract the attention of their prospective buyers. As a matter of fact, market research studies show that excepting for a few discerning buyers, most of them are influenced by the looks and design of the product. Hence, the audio player marketers are vying with each other to get the customers` attention by introducing their audio player devices with unique and sleek designs. As a result, we can find that most Mp3 player products are getting smaller in size day by day and their looks are just getting swankier.

Mp3 player storage capacity and battery life are some of the important features one should look for. Moreover, file format is not also a problem as most of these portable audio devices play all types of music files.

Despite all these Mp3 player features, people have now started picking only those music devices that have multiple functions. For example, products that do not have either a video player or GPS or a camera are less likely to attract the buyers these days. Many others customers are also searching for Mp3 player products with a screen facility to choose and play their favorite tracks whenever they want. So before you buy an Mp3 player, know what else you want from it apart from music. This will help you decide whether you should go for a mono-purpose or multi-purpose audio device player.
