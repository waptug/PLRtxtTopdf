Bows and arrows, the indispensable parts of archery, are of different variety. 
Longbow, shortbow, flatbow, recurve bow, crossbow and compound bow are the different kinds of bows which are being used by the archers. Each one has its own individual characteristics. 

 Longbow is very long; the length of the bow is equal to the height of the user and in some cases even exceeds the height of the user.   The limb of the Flatbow is wider and the cross-section is rectangular in shape.

Shortbow is shorter in length; it is light weight and has a short range. It was basically used for hunting purpose.   In crossbow the limbs are mounted in a horizontal manner and not in a vertical manner. The archer finds it very easy to mount the arrow on the compound bow.  

Shaft, arrowheads, nock and fletching constitute an arrow.  Aluminum alloy, carbon fiber, wood and fiberglass are used for the construction of the shaft.  Depending on the usage the choice of the arrow will differ from person to person.  

The arrow should be tight and not flexible. At present arrows made of carbon alloys are popular; these arrows are used even in Olympics. 

The arrow will be able to hit the target only when it is shot at a proper angle; when the arrow is in the air it should be able to use the air pressure to hit the target.  The arrowhead and fletching provides the requisite balance to the arrow.  

The arrowhead of arrows needs to be made of some hard materials like metals; it is actually the arrowhead which directly strikes the target. Fletching which is at the rear end of the arrow provides balance to the arrow. Bird feathers were used to make fletching but now plastic is also being used. 

In order to hit the target it is necessary that the arrow is shot at an appropriate angle; this will be possible if the bows and arrows are made of fine material.  Archery research will help you make the best use of bows and arrows.
