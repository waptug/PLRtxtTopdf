Iphone's are proving to be tremendously popular, and one of the most popular things to go with it is to download some music videos for it. The Ipod beforehand has proved to be a very popular device, and it's now likely for the Iphone to repeat that success.

In order to download the music videos for the Iphone, the first thing you need to do is to make sure the videos you are downloading are in the MP4 format, as this is the only video format the Iphone can currently support. Luckily you'll find that most sites are primarily based around this format anyway.

The toughest thing about downloading the music videos for the Iphone is actually finding them. It's pretty tough to find the best download sites unless you know where they are. There are several different kinds of site, some of which may well prove to be a lot more trouble than they are worth. Probably the biggest danger is to use a peer to peer site for your downloads. Whilst these sites have been popular in the past, it's best to avoid them as they are breaking the law, and so will you be if you download anything from there. Another major danger is the software itself-you can seriously damage your computer and Iphone by using these sites, as there is no regulation of what is uploaded by the users. This means hackers and spammers use sites like this as a method of introducing new viruses to the internet, putting you at direct risk.

The good news about this is that you can now find a few sites which can offer you all the positive sides of the peer to peer sites, but very few of the negatives. The way it works is that you pay a one off fee to join the site, and in turn they give you unlimited downloads. Because you pay the sites a fee to join, they use the income to keep their downloads clean and regularly add new downloads to their stocks. You'll also find that these kinds of sites keep a lot more in their database than music videos-you'll also find movies and games as well as TV shows. This gives these kinds of sites a tremendous amount of value for money.

If you are looking to download some music videos for your Iphone, this article will hopefully let you know anything you need.
