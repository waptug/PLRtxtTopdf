"There are two kinds of people in the world: those who love chocolate, and communists." - Leslie Moak Murray
I can't help but love that quote. When I was a kid, my grandpa always called any store bought cookies that somehow made it into the house "Commie cookies." For him, it was Grandma's homemade cookies or none at all.
There's just something special about homemade cookies, especially chocolate chip cookies, so far as I'm concerned. It's a great family activity, something even children can help with, and everyone loves eating the results.
Here's an easy recipe for chocolate chip cookies I think you'll enjoy:
Chocolate Chip Cookies
1 package butter pecan, chocolate chip, chocolate fudge, devil's food, German, chocolate or yellow cake mix
1/2 cup  butter or margarine -- softened
1 teaspoon  vanilla
2 eggs
1/2 cup  chopped nuts
1 (6 ounce) package  semisweet chocolate chips (1 cup)
Heat oven to 350º. Combine half of the dry cake mix , butter, vanilla and eggs in large bowl and mix until smooth. Stir in remaining cake mix, nuts and chocolate chips.
Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls about 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until edges are set (centers will be soft). Cool 1 minute; remove from cookie sheet to wire rack.
