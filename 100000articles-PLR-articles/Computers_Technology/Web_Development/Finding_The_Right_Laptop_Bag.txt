Laptop bags come in all shapes, sizes, and colors, but nothing says style and sophistication like leather. The luxurious smell and rich feel of leather simply can't be beaten, and the impression it leaves with other people is subtly unrivaled.

More importantly, a leather bag can provide the best protection for a laptop. After all, that wireless Bluetooth connectivity, 80 GB of hard drive space, powerful processor, and 15 inch display cost a bundle, it only makes sense to shell out a few additional dollars to safeguard that technology. The cheap bags that are often included free with the purchase of a laptop purchase are a perfect example of getting what is paid for. Even heavy-duty nylon construction provides limited protection compared to the natural cushioning a high-quality leather bag possesses.

Premier leather laptop bags are going to be well stitched and constructed with the finest materials. There's no reason to worry about the bottom seam spontaneously failing, allowing the computer to slip out. Furthermore, the leather itself acts as an additional layer of padding to protect the notebook from impact, not counting any actual protective padding sewn into the bag. This padding is particularly reinforced at the bottom of the bag, which cushions the laptop against potential harm with each and every time it is placed down on a surface.

Leather is, of course, not without it's drawbacks. The one burden of leather is that some care is required for it to maintain its supple texture and luster. There are a number of ways to take care of leather, including spraying it with water repellent when it is first bought. The leather should also be cleaned regularly, conditioned, and protected with lubricants and oils to prevent it from hardening, drying out, or otherwise becoming damaged by age. This extra chore is inconsequential compared to the joy of owning a premier bag to carry and protect a computer.

Because of the popularity and commonality of laptops in modern society, the price and selection have switched places. While selection has exploded, prices have steadily dropped, suddenly putting laptop ownership into the budgets of unprecedented numbers of people. This trend means that it is now possible walk into nearly any specialty leather store, department store, or even an office superstore and find good quality leather laptop bags that will fit any taste and budget.
