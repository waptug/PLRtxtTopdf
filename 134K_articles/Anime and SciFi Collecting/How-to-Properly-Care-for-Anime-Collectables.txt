How to Properly Care for Anime Collectables

Are you one of the millions of individuals who enjoys the anime genre?  If you do, you may enjoy watching anime themed movies or television shows, as well as reading anime books.  If you so, have you ever considered started your own collection of anime collectables?  If not, this is a hobby that you may want to examine.  Many new collectors are amazed with just how easy it is to properly maintain and care for an anime collection.

Before focusing on ways that collectors are encouraged to care for and store their anime collectables, it is important to focus on the purposes for collecting. There are a number of different reasons why anime collectors start anime collections.  One of those reasons is for making a profit.  There are a number of rare, hard to find, and even limited edition anime collectables that can be purchased and later resold for a profit. On the other hand, there are anime collectors who are considered pure hobbyists. These are individuals who collect anime collectables and other anime themed merchandise because the genre interests them.

Regardless of the reason for collecting anime collectables and other themed merchandise, all collectors are encouraged to take proper care of their collectables.  One of the best ways to do so is by leaving all new collectables in their original packaging.  This step is one that is advised for collectors who have hopes of later reselling their anime collectables for a profit.  Generally speaking, most collectables retain their values when left in all original packages.  In fact, many collectable pieces will actually increase in value.  Even collectors who may not plan to sell their anime collectables are encouraged to leave all new merchandise as is in the original packaging.

Safe and proper storing is also important.  Many new collectors are pleased with their decision to leave all anime collectables in the original packaging, but many do not take any additional steps from there.  To increase, as well as maintain value, anime collectables, themselves, should not only be well cared for, but their packages should be as well.  For many professional collectors and dealers, the condition of the original package is just as important as the collectable piece itself, in terms of value.  Be sure to choose a location that is safe, clean, and dry.

For collectables that are removed from their package or purchased used, display cases should be used.  Display cases come in a number of different sizes.  There are a wide range of display cases that are designed to fit a number of collectable pieces, including movies, books, trading cards, figurines, posters, and much more.  Display cases can often be purchased online or from local hobby shops.

Despite the fact that many anime collectables can be properly and safely stored in display cases, other options may need to be examined.  For example, anime costumes may be unable to fit into most traditional display cases.  In these instances, the anime collectables in question should be properly and safely packed away.  Collectors are urged to choose clean and dry boxes.  Additional collectable packing supplies, such as silica packs and acid free tissue paper, are advised.


The proper care and storage tips highlight above are just a few of the many that collectors, especially investors, are encouraged to examine.  Those looking to make a profit from their anime collectibles are encouraged to remember that the most money lays with collectables that are properly cared for and well maintained.
