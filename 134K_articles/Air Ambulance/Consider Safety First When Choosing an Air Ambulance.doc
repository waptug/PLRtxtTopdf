}Consider Safety First When Choosing an Air Ambulance\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Times of 
stress often leave people feeling drained and unable to think clearly.  When you
 or a loved one are suffering from medical conditions, stress levels are high.  
It is important to think of safety first when deciding on which air ambulance company
 to use.  Here are some suggestions to help you put safety first in the decision
.\par}

\'92t let the stress and circumstances cloud your mind.  Research the air ambulance
 service thoroughly before making the decision to use their services.  Learn about
 the company and their history.  Find out what certifications the pilot and flight
 crew must possess.  Do the pilot and other crew members meet all FAA requirements
 and certifications?  Is the pilot required to have flight-simulator training?  
If so, how often.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Some companies
 will permit only a single pilot to fly the aircraft.  Although this is not deemed
 unsafe, it is a good idea to fly with an air ambulance service that offers two 
pilots in the cockpit.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Inexperienced
 pilots may not have the hours and background to safely transport patients on a 
medical mission.  Locate an air ambulance company that uses pilots solely dedicated
 to medical missions that require numerous hours of flight time.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Ask about
 the company\u8217\'92s safety record.  Although most companies who offer air ambulance
 services have excellent safety records, you can never be so sure.  Find out for
 yourself.  Do your homework to make sure the company follows the strictest guidelines
 in the industry.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Find out 
if the air ambulance company is a member of CAMTS.  This means that the company 
is certified by the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Services.  
Membership varies throughout the industry, but with no federal standards in place
, it is a way to be certain that minimum competency and safety standards are being
 met.  To receive certification, the company commits to being evaluated on educational
 standards, safety, equipment, staffing, maintenance,\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Communication
, and administration.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 When considering
 an air ambulance transportation service, find out if the company employs a medical
 director.  This person should be a licensed physician trained in all the areas 
of critical care and emergency treatment.  This person should be available for consultation
 during a transport if questions should arise.  Also, to encourage quality control
, this individual will review the circumstances of the transport to ensure that 
all medical protocols were followed correctly.  This person oversees the training
 of medical staff and is responsible for the actions of the medical team during 
the transport.  A company with such a person on staff has a lot at stake, so quality
 and standards will be high in such a case.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 How many 
medical professionals accompany the patient during transport?  In many situations
, an air ambulance service may only send out one medically trained person on each
 flight.  In some instances, this is safe for patients, but if an emergency should
 occur, it is best to have a minimum of two medically trained personnel on hand 
to completely handle the emergency situation.  The trained staff should have experience
 in emergency treatment and critical care.  In specialized cases, more members should
 accompany a patient and the number of the team increases.  This is true in cases
 that require a  respiratory therapist, for example.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Investigating
 air ambulance services may seem overwhelming at the time, but knowing that the 
patient\u8217\'92s needs should come first is important.  Safety of the patient 
is evident in companies that strive for excellence.  Check out the air ambulance
 company and their safety record for an indication of the company\u8217\'92s quality
 and level of experience before making the final decision.    \par}
