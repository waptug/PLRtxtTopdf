Well, well, well.  I had always thought that the inefficiency of the slow moving bureaucracy that is humankind would have put off hell freezing over for at least 10 or 15 years.  But, I am a big enough person to admit when I am wrong.  But perhaps finding sufficient market demand to allow consumers to pay for and download TV shows that they simply weren’t capable of rearranging their schedule to accommodate for further pop culture consumption must be one of the signs that such a point is closing in upon us.  Welcome to ipod shows.

So, you unfortunately have to go to a funeral that you just can’t get out of, but it happens that the new episode of Monk is on at the same time; and the network has really been touting this week as a blockbuster episode.  Well, no problem, all you need to do is log on to the apple website and go into the istore where you’ll find all things ipod.  Once you’ve found ipod shows you just need to choose the network and the get to the show and you can purchase it and download it.

Having Monk as an ipod show on your ipod is almost better than having skipped the funeral and watched the show at home, even if you taped it for later viewing.  This way, you’ll always have it to watch as many times as you’d like, plus you don’t need to sit on your couch to do so, you can run all over town watching the show if you want.  But, its not to say that you couldn’t also still just sit on your couch and indulge.  Ipod shows are here so download them while you still can, because I can hear the crackling of forming ice in the living room of Beezelbub’s rec room.
