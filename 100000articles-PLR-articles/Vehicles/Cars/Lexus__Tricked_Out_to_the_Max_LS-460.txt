Article Body:
Driving enthusiasts have come to expect more and more technological features equipped with their new cars. Just one generation ago, getting something above an AM radio was considered a bonus, but today there are so many electronic devices out there, that motorists expect more…a lot more in fact. Lexus is about to push up the ante a bit more by introducing its all new LS-460, a car that has been electronically “tricked out” to the max. If you thought your personal computer had power, just wait: the LS-460 will likely have you beat by a high tech mile.

The world’s love affair with all things high tech continues unabated. Personal computers, cell phones, wi-fi, IPODS, are some of the electronic devices we use on a regular basis. Imagine a world without consumer electronics…a scary thought, right? Well, the good folks at the Toyota Motor Company don’t want you to be without as evidenced in the cars that they are building. Toyota’s luxury division, Lexus, is a leader in providing top quality, extremely reliable luxury cars, but the company doesn’t stop there. Many models are equipped with all of the latest electronic gadgetry and the coming LS-460 will be the leader of the pack as it will offer the following features:

-- A 30GB hard drive which will be partitioned for music and navigation.

-- A touch screen and voice activated navigation system.

-- Bluetooth phone control technology.

-- 19 speaker audio system that reads MP3 audio formats.

-- 3 onboard cameras to warn drivers about lane departure and to assist in parking the car.
 
-- Monitored telematics with live traffic reports.

Of course, what good is any car if it is nothing more than an electronic play station? In the case of the LS-460, the vehicle will lead in many different engineering categories including:

-- The LS-460 will feature the first 8 speed automatic transmission.

-- A 4.6L V8 producing 380 hp and 370 lbs of torque will be standard. The engine will feature a dual fuel induction system combining direct and port fuel injection.

-- The LS-460 will be a certified ultra low emissions vehicle able to go from zero to 60 in under 5.5 seconds.

Lexus lovers will also likely be drawn to the car’s improved chassis, more refined suspension, and rakish body style which now will include a long wheelbase version topping out at a whopping 203 inches.

Yes, the LS-460 is one “tricked out” luxury car. Retail prices haven’t been set yet, but expect this technologically charged luxury liner will likely sell for in excess of $60,000. Chump change for the rich and famous, agreed?
