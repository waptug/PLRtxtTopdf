The better they know you as a consumer, the better are the chances of their making up more money.

Your opinion is precious to the company whose products and services you use. As they spend numerous pounds on advertising after making new products, they wish to know what you as a customer think. They pay you for your feedback in online surveys, discussion forums, product testings and interviews. It works simple. As they pay you, it makes them earn more, they also learn what you prefer and wish for. Thus, the companies are indeed ready to pay more for the valuable consumer opinions. 

While marketing the products this way, they are not making any favor to you but actually seeking favors from you. And it is for this favor they pay to encourage you.

The old fashioned ways of collecting data was expensive because the old ways had a normally less response rate.

There are companies who are ready to pay you up to $ 99 for each online survey. Online surveys are the regular forms that are made by the marketing research companies. They generate them with the aim of getting information on any specific product or service. Further a detailed investigation is performed on your feedback and is passed on to the top companies.

Internet has introduced a new medium for the companies to get the data of market research. As most of the ventures are present on the net, market research by online survey is a fast-evolving field.

Each company has a little different approach to motivate you to make you fill out the online surveys. The one thing that they have in common is that they have a complete registration process and qualification process. Get registered, enter your detailed profile and get a user name and password. Considering your profile the companies make out who is eligible for their surveys.
