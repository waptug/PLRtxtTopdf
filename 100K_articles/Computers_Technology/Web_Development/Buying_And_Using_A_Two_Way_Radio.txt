Two-way radios are fun and useful tools. You can use them for safety, or just for fun. The type of two-way radio set that you buy will depend very much on what kind of usage you want to get out of it. There is a huge variety of features that are included with two-way radios. Someone who is new to them may not be aware of all these features, and would therefore not know what to look for. So read on to find out some of the basics of two-way radios.

First you should consider the basic components of the two-way radio. Batteries are important, and there are quite a few different possibilities. One type that many people prefer is an internal rechargeable battery. This means that when your radio is low on power, you just plug it into the wall and let it charge up. Other people prefer standard replaceable batteries, so that they can simply buy some new batteries and swap them out at a moment’s notice. It all depends on your personal preference. If you don’t mind bothering with regular batteries, then that option is probably more flexible – especially if you won’t be able to recharge for a few days. Otherwise, you can probably save money by getting an internal battery.

Some two-way radios have special functions built in that will help you to navigate outdoors. Compasses are particularly popular. If you plan to use your two-way radios for outdoor activities such as hiking or hunting, then a compass could come in handy. There are even high-end systems that combine GPS systems with two-way radios to make the ultimate outdoor gadget that will prepare you for exploration and adventure.

With some two-way radios, GMRS channels are available. That stands for General Mobile Radio Service. This opens up a range of exclusive frequencies routed through GMRS stations that will facilitate better reception with your two-way radios. It does slightly complicate things, as you will have to obtain a GMRS license. The process is fairly simple, and as long as you are over 18 you should have it within a few days. GMRS functionality is considered slightly extravagant when buying a two-way radio. For casual usage, you aren’t likely to make much use of it. But if you are a two-way radio enthusiast who depends on his radio to be in range at all times, then it could be a worthwhile investment.

Two-way radios are not only fun to mess around with, but they’re also important tools to bring with you for all sorts of activities. If you get trapped in the wilderness or lost while hunting, a two-way radio might just save your life. So, look into the possibility of buying a two-way radio. Make sure to get exactly what you need, and no more. You can spend a lot of money getting the most state-of-the-art radio possible when you actually won’t use half of the features you get. Being informed of your options, you will hopefully be able to make the best choice and get a two-way radio that will serve you well.
