What is franchising? It is the method of entering a franchise agreement wherein two parties agree to do business with contractual provisions. The setting would be, one party has an idea of the business while the second party will do the business of the other party and pay for its name and reputation.

Many prefer franchising than setting up their own name. That is because they do benefit from it. One benefit it provides is the speed of expansion that one may get once he has entered the franchising world. There is already a brand image since the company will have one common system that will be followed.

Franchisees may also enjoy from discounts on the supplies and raw materials needed in operating the business. Franchise networks buy in bulk, which makes more room for greater discounts among franchisees. Therefore, if the supplies and raw material are cheaper it will be easier to compete with other establishments.

There is also a greater opportunity for a higher profit. The return of investment is higher since the return of revenue will be lower. This means that the percentage of pure profit is higher.

Franchisees that are within the network are able to offer knowledge that has been learned based on their experiences in the field. This is a knowledge that is not learned in business schools. Getting connected with experienced franchisees can also help in expanding the business overseas where there are greater opportunities.

4. The person should be able to learn lessons from past decisions made in this field. Lessons learned might not be from him but from others who have encountered wrong decisions.
