So what make the sedu tourmaline flat iron so good?  

Well the tourmaline iron itself has the smoothest plates available on any hair iron so this will not only stop any pulling or breakage it will also prevent your hair turning dry and frizzy.

One of the best key features about the sedu tourmaline iron in my opinion is it has a temperature control button. The best thing about this feature is you can adjust it to the temperature that best suites your hair. This way you can guarantee your hair will retain its moisture and give it that perfect shine every time. It may take some using before you work out which temperature best suites your type of hair but you’ll find it sone enough.

Another great feature is it is equipped with an IDCI plug; this will eliminate any chances of you being electrocuted while in the process of giving your self that thousand-dollar hairstyle.

And the best part of all?  It will only take you half the time that other hair irons take to do your hair.

Ok how does it work? 

The secrets in its space age technology the actual ceramic plates are infused with a jewel called tourmaline. Now the negative ion and infrared heat sensor will really deliver what other flat irons cant. All this combined results in the product being light weight, safe and ready to use just about any where. Now before you rush out and buy one make sure you look around as I have found a lot of companies offer different length warranties “obversely you want the longer warrantee” so take your time. Ok if you’re after a hair iron that really delivers then this is it. I have not heard any bad reviews about it and if its good enough for Jennifer Aniston, Angelina Jolie and Jennifer lopez well I’m sure you will be more than happy to have you very own celebrity hair style!!
