When I woke up this morning and flipped on the news, I realized the temperature had plummeted last night. It was now two degrees below zero. YIKES, that is frigid! I dreaded stepping outdoors to take my little girl to school. Thank God for forced gas heat and fireplaces. I knew the heat would be kicking-on all day long. Fortunately I had my fireplace cleaned and ready to go. The wood was stacked and the matches were close at-hand. Before I knew it, I was enjoying a cozy, blazing fire while I worked. Now I realize that a wood-burning fireplace is not for everyone. Luckily for those who have them, but don't want them, there are fireplace gas logs. You can alter your wood-burning fireplace and turn it into a gas unit. Then you'll be enjoying a hot fire at the mere flip of a switch. 

I think it's all the hassles. As far as wood-burning fireplaces go, I suppose people don't care to deal with the mess anymore. That's why they turn to fireplace gas logs. You see, with a wood-burning unit, you have a few chores to take care of each winter. First you have to purchase wood, unless you already have your own sources. Then comes the stacking just outside your home. Be sure to cover it with a durable tarp so it doesn't get wet. Wet wood doesn't burn well and it smokes like crazy. Next you'll probably want a bin or stand to hold your wood near the fireplace. Keep it stacked daily. And then there's the clean-up. It's wise to keep the ashes scooped out of your fireplace on a regular basis. This makes it much simpler to build and light the next time around. So, there you have it. The burdens of a traditional fireplace. I'll bet you can't wait to get those fireplace gas logs now. Once the gas unit is fully set up, you only need the pilot light lit. From there on out, it's all about convenience. Anyone in your home can start the fireplace, just like turning on a light. 

Check your local vendors. From my experience, home superstores such as Lowe's carry fireplace gas logs and electric fireplace units. Head on over to the one nearest you and find out what they charge. There will be an installation cost as well.
