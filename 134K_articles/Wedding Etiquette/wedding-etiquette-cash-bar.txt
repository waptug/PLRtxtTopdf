Wedding Etiquette: Cash Bar Wedding Parties<br><br>

Open bar wedding party has been gaining popularity these days because more and more couples have been celebrating an evening wedding. With open bar, guests are free to order any brand of drink to their liking without limit as to how many shots or glasses they should order.<br><br>
