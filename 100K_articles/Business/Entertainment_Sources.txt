It is the digital revolution era. Almost every electronic component is digitalized. Though more expensive, digital equipment is preferred, because the quality is superior. When investing in digital equipment, an important factor to consider is the nature of the entertainment center that will accommodate them. A digital entertainment center houses all the digital equipment in one unit. It allows users to access their music, movies, home videos and photos from a single device via a remote control.

Users can purchase a digital entertainment center that doubles as a media center for their TV or projector and have access to all the media functions at one place. Any device such as a DVI, component video, VGA, S-Video or composite video can be used to make this connection.

With a digital entertainment center, it is possible to perform a number of operations from a single device. A user can pause, replay and record any TV program from cable, digital cable, digital satellite or over-the-air TV with the help of a personal video recorder, and transfer photos from a camera. Some entertainment centers allow a person to perform various functions simultaneously. For instance, it is possible to simultaneously watch TV or a video in one room and play music in another. It is also possible to record a favorite program and write them on DVDs.

The best part about digital entertainment centers is that they allow a user to perform so many different tasks at once. The quality of its media output is also enhanced. As they are not bulky and do not occupy as much space as the traditional entertainment centers, it is possible to merge them into the décor of a home irrespective of its size.

Televisions come in a variety of sizes ranging from the corner stand TVs to the complete range of home theater systems. While finding a place to store a normal size TV proves no problem, finding space for your big screen entertainment center may require some elaborate planning.

For setting up a big screen entertainment center, you need to first make a list of components and equipment that will be needed. A typical list of components will include the TV, VCR, laser disc player or DVD player, stereo system, and console-based game station.

Given the varied assortment of the components involved and their sizes, big screen entertainment centers take up a lot of space in any room – living or bedroom. That means they need to be aligned to any one wall in a room. Apart from the electronic equipment, these big screen solutions also have provisions for books and a computer.

This means that these centers can fulfill the relaxation and recreational needs of several people at once and therefore, these entertainment centers become the converging point for entire family. The position of a big screen entertainment center also determines the setting of the entire room.

An entertainment center aligned to a wall can become the anchor of the entire room, around which the rest of the furniture such as the sofa, is arranged. The entertainment center and the rest of the furniture of the room should blend aesthetically with the décor and color scheme of the room.

In fact, a host of contemporary and traditional designs allow for the TV, DVD player, PC and other peripheral components to blend gracefully together with each other as also with the décor of the rest of the room.

All said, television is only one of the many elements of a big screen entertainment center. In addition, you can also place your PC in the entertainment center and use it to download music or video. Yet the TV continues to rule supreme as the biggest home entertainment provider. To get the complete theater sound effect, you can connect surround-sound speaker systems. The sound of these systems varies depending on where you place them.
