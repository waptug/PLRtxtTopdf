The price of fuel and gas is skyrocketing and the effects of it are surely being felt by everybody else who owns a car or drives a car. Despite this situation, you actually could do much so as to alleviate the heavy burden of gas and fuel prices. 

First off, you should check and go through your car? Are there stacks of school books inside? Are there gym bags and other clothes that seem to be forgotten? Are there collections of shells, pebbles, and rocks that your kids collected at the beach? If there are, these items actually add to the additional and not needed weight in your vehicle. You see, the more and the heavier the items inside your car add to the consumption of gas. So better remove all those unnecessary items inside. 

When you are driving on the highway, try using cruise control. That is, if you have such a feature on your car. This technique would save you much on gas. Also, jackrabbit starts should be avoided at all costs. Also avoid speeding from one stop sign to the next. Keep in mind that you should accelerate slowly. 

If you are planning to wait for more than three minutes, it is best that you turn off your engine first instead of just letting it idle. Now, you should try using high-octane gasoline if you have a engine that is pinging. What is pinging, you may ask? Pinging is actually a noise that sounds like a rattle and it comes from your engine. The most usual times that you can hear this kind of noise is when you are accelerating or when you are driving uphill.
