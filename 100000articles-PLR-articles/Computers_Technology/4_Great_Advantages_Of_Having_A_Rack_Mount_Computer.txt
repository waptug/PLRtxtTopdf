1. Really provides better cooling for your computer hardware

We all know that heat can really kill the motherboard, processor and other chips that are found in a computer case. If the temperature is too much it can fry the chips and leave your computer worthless. The more work you do, the longer you do it, the higher the workload on the pc. This causes heat to build up inside your computer. The traditional cooling fan that you can find on the back of the power supply of your computer is normally not enough to get it all the cooling it needs. Even with the other fan attached to the processor chip, your computer will most of the time not get all the cooling it needs.

If you were to use a rack, this would help to give your computer the cooling it needs, since it gives you a lot more space, unlike computers that don’t have racks.

2. You’ll have better air circulation

Without adequate space for your computer, there won't be good air circulation and this can damage many things in your computer. A rack mount computer therefore gets better air circulation than one without it. And this goes a long way in protecting your computer.

3. Prevents vibration when playing load music

Good computer racks out there have vibration-dampening tendencies to prevent the vibration of your computer- especially when listening to load music from your speakers. Without these vibration-dampening tendencies, your speakers and even compute can slowly slip off your desktop, thereby causing damage.

4. Give more space for your computer

Your rack mount computer has more space than others without one. You are able to do more work than if you didn't have a rack for your computer.

If you take all the above advantages into consideration you will come to find that using a rack mount computer instead of one without a rack is the way to go.
