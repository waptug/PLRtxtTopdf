Working in an office environment makes the effectiveness of proper office supplies important. Whether a business is large or small, printing folders for presentations can be done in a cost effective manner. However, most companies make large quantities price cuts, which often has smaller businesses buying less so to stay on budget. While working for myself, the need for small runs of professional looking products is vital to my success. 

When shopping for a printing company, I discovered that most often these other printers produce folders on low-quality stock that creases easily, leaving them looking non-professional. Some companies even have you doing some do it yourself assembly, which adds to the overall time frame of the work. However, one company seems to fit the mold to avoid all of these disadvantages for companies and offers an added bonus --- free business cards. 

With their help, cost-effective projects are completed, which promote the products and services of your company. They often are the proper solution for your printing problems, while being printed on 350gsm silk stock. In addition, all the assembly is done when you receive the job. Each folder includes a spot to place your business card, which adds to the overall professionalism involved with the folders. 

The quantity you need will be printed --- no minimum quantity orders are processed. Designs are also available to be created in case you do not have in-house designers or just don’t have the time to put into it. A team of creative, talented and professional designers will create a design to fit your professional needs. Often times, printing projects are a stressful task for businesses. By leaving it to the printing company to design, print and assembly, businesses can relieve themselves of the stress involved with this work. 

Most wonder how one company can work this way while others require minimum runs that most often discourage small businesses from doing business with them. However, with this work ethic, maximum efficiency occurs and overall customer satisfaction occurs. With professional presses, high quality prints are created even on low runs and leaves me satisfied with every order. 

Overall customer satisfaction is important. When ordering because of their PDF workflow ethic, I was able to receive proofs of my design before it was printed. This added to my overall satisfaction with the company. Overall, with keeping all businesses in mind, the future success of their work will be continued to supply professional looking products for its customers – big or small.
