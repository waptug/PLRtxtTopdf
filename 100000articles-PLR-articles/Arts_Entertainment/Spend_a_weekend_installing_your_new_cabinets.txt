Once the sink and its fittings have been removed, disassemble the counter tops and remove the cabinets. You will need a hammer, pry-bar, putty knife, screw gun, crowbar, ladder and saw. 

Most counter tops are made of plywood, nailed to the base cabinets, with the finish material laid on top. Tile can be difficult to save as they crack and fly off in pieces. Plastic laminate counter tops and wood slabs are generally nailed or screwed to the base cabinet. 

Remove the base units first so that you can get underneath the wall cabinets for easier disassembly. Remove all doors and drawers before attempting to remove the cabinets. 

If you plan to reuse the hardware, clean and store all the pulls, knobs and their screws in plastic bags. Cabinets can be attached in a variety of ways. Older types are usually nailed to the wall, 

Newer units will more likely be held into place with screws. Some models may even be hung on metal or wood cabinet hangers. Metal cabinets are usually attached with hangers. 

Pry the cabinet loose while another person supports it from below. Add a block of wood between the wall surface and the pry-bar to avoid marring the wall. 

Base cabinets are often attached to the wall at the top and can be unscrewed or pried loose. Remove the cove molding or carefully pry away the baseboard at the floor. Remove any nails and lift the cabinet away from the wall and floor.
