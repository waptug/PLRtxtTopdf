Are you one of many Americans who find it hard to clear your credit card minimum every month?  If you are, you are most probably in credit card debts.

For your information, credit card debt is one of the most difficult types of debt to clear. Reasons being, credit card companies charge very high interest rate and of course always slap you with a high late payment or penalty fees whenever you cannot make your payment.

To get out of this mess, you will need to consolidate your credit card debts either yourself or with the help of an external agency.

<b>1. Consolidate your debt yourself.</b>
It’s neither easy nor too difficult to consolidate your own credit card debts. Almost every credit card company has their in house debt consolidation department to help their clients consolidate their credit card bills. What you need to do is to call them, and tell them your situation truthfully.

The chances of consolidating your debts successfully depend on how you put forward your situation to your creditors. How your creditors access your current financial health also play a part. Before you start to call your creditors, it might be wise to check out for more tips and guide on how to negotiate with your creditors online.

<b>2. Engage the service of debt consolidation companies and programs.</b>
There are many free government programs to help people consolidate their debts, but these free services often require that you chalk up a certain amount of debts before they help and you must also meet their requirements.

The last option would be to engage the service of debt consolidation companies. By charging you a fee, debt consolidation companies will negotiate with your creditors for lower interest, better repayment method and lastly help you devise a financial plan to help clear your debts in a systematic way.

No matter what options you take to consolidate your debt, do it early and you will get a live a debt-free life again.
