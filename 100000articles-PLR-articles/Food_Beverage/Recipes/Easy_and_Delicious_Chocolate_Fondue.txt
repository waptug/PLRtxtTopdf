I mean, really! Who wouldn't love this decadent dessert? Forget the diet! And who says you have to wait for dessert? Treat yourself once in a while and have it for dinner! Why not? Life is short.

Since the Swiss take all the credit for making up this wonderous invention of fondue eating... it only stands to reason that continuing the practice would carry over to dessert.

I love chocolate. And anything that you can mix with it. So, learning how to make chocolate fondue for my friends and family was a real treat for me. And the idea of melting chocolate, adding things like nuts, or marshmellows, or fruit, or cake just sends me over the moon! And when you dive into these recipes for this dreamy dessert, you'll be joining me on the other side of that ol' moon.

Here's how to make chocolate fondue that will melt any choco-holic's heart:

<b>What you'll need:</b><br>
- 1 cup premium cocoa powder (ex:Scharffen Berger), sifted<br>
- 1 1/4 cup water<br>
- 1 1/2 cups sugar<br>
- 1/4 cup corn syrup<br>
- 1/2 cup plus 5 Tbsp heavy cream<br>
- 5 oz 62% Scharffen Berger (premium semi-sweet chocolate), chopped<br>
- Pound cake and fruit (ex. bananas, apples, strawberries, plums), cut into bite sized pieces

First, sift the cocoa into mixing bowl and set aside. When I was learning how to make chocolate fondue, I found out that sifting the cocoa is the real trick to making this recipe work. It helps create the smooth creamy texture that you want for serving.

Then, place the water, sugar, and corn syrup into a pot and bring to boil. Allow the mixture to simmer for 10-15 minutes until sugar solution has reduced by about 30%. Pour the cocoa powder a little bit at a time into the solution and blend with a whisk until nice and smooth.

Next, return the chocolate mixture to the stove and continue cooking over medium heat. Add the heavy cream, bring it to a boil and allow to simmer for five minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in your chopped chocolate. Pour it all into a ceramic fondue pot or one appropriate and keep warm until ready to serve.

Presenting your fabulous chocolate fondue dessert with cut up pieces of cake and fruit is a wonderful way to end your evening with a bang!
