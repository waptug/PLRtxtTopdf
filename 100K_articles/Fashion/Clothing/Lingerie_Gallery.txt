All these pieces come in a full range of colors from classic black and white to baby pink and deep red. In addition, they are represented in a gorgeous choice of fabrics. No wonder that women just get dazzled by the tremendous diversity, which they come across at a lingerie store.

That’s why there exist different Lingerie Galleries, which introduce various types of undergarments, and assist you in getting acquainted with modern lingerie collections. On-line galleries provide you not only with information, but also give you an opportunity to see how apparel looks on a model.

Lingerie Galleries can be of different types. There are bridal, maternity, everyday, plus size, classy, sexy, intimate, fine, and even dirty collections.

Everyday lingerie galleries exhibit comfortable and simple undergarments, made from soft and smooth fabrics. The most popular pieces are seamless and underwired bras, cotton panties and briefs. Apart from comfort and support, everyday lingerie provides you with attractive designs.

Classy lingerie galleries suggest the golden mean. This lingerie is not so sultry and wild as sexy apparel, but at the same time it’s a little bit more elaborate and stylish than just everyday undergarments. It includes bras, briefs, robes, nightgowns, pajamas, etc.

Fine lingerie galleries show undergarments that are created for women, who prefer to live in luxury and lavishness every day.This lingerie is made from silky and delicate fabrics and includes briefs, push-up bras, panties, etc.

Intimate lingerie galleries offer undergarments that can spice up your relationship and add a spark to your night. All pieces are sultry and saucy; the designs are sizzling and adventurous. They show a great deal of laces, ribbons and decorations.

Plus size galleries contain undergarments specially designed for full figure women. They include apparel that reduces women’s silhouette and improves posture. Modern large size lingerie is as enticing and sexy as any for women of average measurements. There are all kinds of bras and briefs available, as well as babydolls, teddies, corsets, robes, etc.

Bridal lingerie galleries show the most popular apparel to be put on beneath your weeding dress. This lingerie is rather functional than decorative, as it should go with your dress perfectly improving its lines. Basques and nuage bras are favorites here. Yet, many other varieties are exhibited as well.

Attending Lingerie Gallery is a very convenient way of purchasing undergarments. Apart from exhibiting lingerie, it provides you with new information and new inspiration. Although you may go there just to satisfy your curiosity, it’s quite difficult to resist the temptation to buy a piece. How could one remain indifferent to the beauty of styles, transparency of fabrics and delicacy of colors!
