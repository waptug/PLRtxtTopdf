}Youth ATV\u8217\'92s, Why Size Does Matter\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 If your child
 wants an ATV, you may be hesitant because of safety concerns. While many injuries
 occur every year, many of them are preventable if children take the proper safety
 precautions and ride the correct sized ATV. It may not seem like the size of the
 ATV would matter much, but when it comes to kids and ATV\u8217\'92s, size does 
matter. Children should not be allowed to ride an adult sized ATV for many reasons
. Large ATV\u8217\'92s take a lot of strength to control and usually have more powerful
 engines that allow them to go much faster then youth ATV\u8217\'92s. Children should
 have the opportunity to hone their driving skills on a smaller, slower ATV before
 they graduated to an adult sized ATV when they are older, stronger, and more experienced
. ATV\u8217\'92s can be a source of great fun and a worthwhile hobby for children
. They should always be supervised when riding and wear appropriate safety gear. 
Many places required minors to wear helmets by law and prohibit them from riding
 adult sized ATV\u8217\'92s. Even if this is not a requirement in your area, it 
is still a good idea and will keep your child safe while pursuing their ATV hobby
.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Children 
and pre-teens (ages 6-12) should ride an ATV with an engine size of 70cc or smaller
. There are larger models for teenagers, and while age should be a factor in which
 ATV you choose for your child, other things such as maturity, size, and strength
 should also be taken into consideration. A smaller child who is 16 should still
 ride a smaller ATV, and while this may not be optimal for them, it is imperative
 for their safety. Your child should only drive an ATV that they can comfortable
 handle.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 When buying
 an ATV for your child, you should make sure it is the correct fit for them. Your
 child should be able to reach the ground with their feet, without standing on their
 tiptoes. They should be able to comfortable reach the handle bars without having
 to overextend their arms. Their arms should be slightly bent as they have a firm
 grip on the handle bars. They should also be able to reach the ground with their
 feet and have their legs slightly bent. Getting your child an ATV they can comfortably
 control is important and will help to keep them safe. \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 As well as
 age and size, your child\u8217\'92s maturity level also plays an important part
 in what type of ATV you buy them. You will have to consider if your child can shift
 gears or would do better with an automatic transmission. If you want to retain 
control over your child\u8217\'92s ATV, whether you think their driving skills need
 some work or they will have problems following rules, you can consider getting 
an ATV with a remote switch to turn off the ATV of your child gets into trouble. 
Buying an ATV for your child is not a decision to be taken lightly. You should make
 sure your child knows that an ATV is not a toy and can be dangerous. Make sure 
they ride an appropriate sized ATV and always wear protective gear.\par}
