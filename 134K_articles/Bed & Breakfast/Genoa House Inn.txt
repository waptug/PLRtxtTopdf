Genoa House Inn

Historic Genoa, near Lake Tahoe and Carson City in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, is Nevada's oldest settlement. It is the location of the Genoa House Inn, an authentic Victorian home listed in the National Register of Historical Places. The house has been restored to the charm and tranquility of an earlier time.

The Rose Room is accented in mallard green and burgundy, has a hand-made barn wood queen-size bed, and is furnished with Victorian antiques. This spacious room has a private balcony and large, stained glass windows.

The Blue Room is accented in a soft gray-blue with mahogany antiques and a queen bed. The private bath in the hall is equipped with a Jacuzzi tub and an overhead shower.

The Garden Room offers a queen bed and is accessed by a gentle path leading across the yard to a covered porch with a private entrance. Take a relaxing bath in the claw foot bathtub.

Early in the morning, your choice of coffee or tea is delivered to your door, followed by a full breakfast served either in your room or in the sunlit dining room.

Genoa is an image of the Old West, with a panoramic view of the abundant Carson Valley and the nearby mountains. Genoa's local activities consist of soaring, ballooning, and bicycling in the Valley. The allure of the old town invites you to a casual walk, touring the Victorian homes and antique buildings with their various businesses, from Nevada's oldest saloon to nearby David Walley's Hot Springs.

Genoa House is only minutes away from surrounding attractions: everything from skiing and boating at Lake Tahoe to the historical sights of Virginia City. Capture its charm with your camera or just your heart. Whatever you do, this place will forever remain a part of your fondest memories.
