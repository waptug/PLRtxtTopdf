First of all, if you're just finding out about electronic currency exchange trading, then probably you're still asking "what in the world does this electronic currency business is", and most importantly, "how do I make money from it?"

Well, you are reading this at the right time, because electronic currency exchange is a business that is expanding and offering new ways to profit from it. This means that in the next months learning how to trade digots will prove to be more profitable than it is today. 

But what does "digot" mean? 

Digot is the value of a given currency when using the electronic currency exchange system. So if your account is in dollars, then a digot will stand for a dollar. If you are reading this, it means you are interested in making more money, and I must congratulate you, because electronic currency exchange is a fantastic vehicle to make money without much work required. This is why some people call this opportunity the anti-business. 

If you like the old saying "the less you work, the more you make" then you will love the electronic currency exchange business. Let me explain how it works:

You get started with whatever amount of money seems reasonable to you. I got started with $200, but I've heard of people getting started trading digots with amounts ranging from $50 to $10,000 so it's entirely up to you and what you can afford. Keep in mind that the more you start with, the faster you will see profits, so it may be worth not buying that new PC to put in as much as you can from the start.

After you have the electronic currencies set up, every 24 hour period you will generate from 2 to 4 percent of your investment. 

What makes this system so profitable, is that you have the option of reinvesting your profits, so that you gain interest of what you gained interests the day before AKA "Compounded interest" over your digots. It's very easy to see how your money can have the snowball effect and turn into a truly automatic cash machine. 

When I was looking to get started, I started with an online course, so I had no learning curve. This is the path I recommend, but if you are short of money, you can also exchange your time and efforts and research online for how to trade ecurrencies.
