Summary:
I’ve pondered long and hard what recipe or Asian food I shall blog about. After much thought, I decided to share with you the humble Egg Fried Rice.

Why the Egg Fried Rice, you might ask? Well, for starters, the very first dish I learnt to cook (after graduating from frying eggs) was Egg Fried Rice. I was only 11 years old then. It is a simple dish and sure fills the stomach. It is also popular in most chinese restaurants and take-aways.

Article Body:
This is my version of the no-frills Egg Fried Rice. Super simple and serves 2 persons.

Ingredients

    * 2 cups / rice bowls cold cooked rice
    * 2 eggs, lightly beaten
    * 4 shallots (thinly sliced)

Seasoning :

    * 1 ½ tsp light soy sauce
    * salt and pepper to taste

Garnishing:

    * Chopped spring onions, sliced cucumbers and tomatoes

Method
Heat one to two tablespoons oil in a wok and fry shallots till fragrant and light brown. Remove fried shallots.

Whilst oil is still hot, add the rice and stir-fry well. Pour in seasoning and continue to stir-fry for about 3 minutes. Pour in eggs and fry until properly cooked. The rice should be coated and yellowish-brown in colour.
Sprinkle the fried shallots over the rice. Dish out and serve with garnishing.
