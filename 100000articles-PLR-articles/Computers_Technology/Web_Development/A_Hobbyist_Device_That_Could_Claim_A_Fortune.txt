Metal detectors of all types may be termed as device for hobbyists either in land (parks, beaches, shores, and even in ballpark bleachers), or deep-sea waters.  Seldom would hunters of all kinds set to track on land, or to ferry on sea without this device.  

These hobbyists or adventurers may find it very beneficial not in terms of using this device to really get expected hunt like the archeologists and the sea fearer underwater hunters and pirates, but it provides a lot of enjoyment and exercise attainable at any rate just like in athletic gymnasiums.

Viewing from the immediate past, the misconception of metal detector is that of a very bulky backpack that is shoulder breaking, conceptualized in relation to the heavy adventurous perk of one who goes out for great land or sea adventures.  Today, the modern innovation of such device devaluated that bulky heavy concept for metal detectors are sleek, lightweight rig, easy to use and handy that won't make someone tire until he spots his pot of gold.

The Underwater Metal Detector

Considered a best companion for sea fearers, sea sports enthusiasts, and fishermen, this underwater device serves best beside a batch of other equipment to any hunter at sea.  A deep ocean adventure is incomplete without this piece of metal device, and it is very valuable at all cost.  To a skilled scuba diver, having it is a must before his plunge into the deep waters.

Manufacturers who have reached high levels of expertise in metal detector design, and perfected pulse discovery techniques over the years paved ways to cope with today's innovation of the underwater metal searcher.   Both amateur and professional divers could avail alike for easy use, handling, reliability, and practicability.

One of the best, if not, the best in metal detector today; the Elsec Metal Detector 2000 manufactured of tough non-corrosive construction for heavy-duty, using PVC ultimate High-Pressure moldings.

High-level sensitivity competes with other metal detectors with usage of the pulse inductive detection techniques on either ferrous or non-ferrous, and iron of divalent nature, and extensive distances.

With usability in approximate depth of 200 meters, it is neutrally buoyant, and controllable.  To add it all in convenience, is the "no switch on and off" of power, for it automatically does so on both; upon immersion and up, from underwater. 

A solid-state indicator alerts awareness how long will the battery last, but this model is furnished with rechargeable batteries that will automatically let power last for 10 hours.

When metal is detected, you'll be directed to three ways attraction, (1) a graduated illuminated meter, (2) a solid flashing indicator, and a (3) variable frequency bone conductor earphone.

By using the best quality electronic components in the manufacture of underwater metal detector serves assurance in reliability and easy maintenance.  If anything goes wrong unexpectedly, the circuit board could be out rightly replaced.
