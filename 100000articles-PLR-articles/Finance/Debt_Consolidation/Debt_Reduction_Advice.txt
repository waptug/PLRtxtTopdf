Reduce wasteful expenditure. For example if you can't afford to buy a $1500 chaise lounge, then go for cheaper options or delay the expenditure for the next month when you can afford to buy it.

This can mean that you may be working long hours. So you may end up working 100 hours in a week. That can be big sacrifice especially if you don't get to see your family.
