Boise, Idaho - 24 November 2007 - Online media download tool YouTubeX.com has today been relaunched as VideoDownloadX.com, to reflect its reach beyond YouTube.com in allowing users to download streaming media files to their hard drive for easier, quick access.

Owned by media company MindImage LLC, VideoDownloadX.com is a multi-purpose conversion tool designed to allow its users to save and download media files from sites like YouTube.com and iFilm.com to enable them to compile playlists of their favourite videos for later access.

The brand realignment of YouTubeX.com is designed as a response to the impact of the latest Google agenda against sites with ‘YouTube’ contained within the URL, in order to prevent any loss of search engine visibility for the service.

Having already hijacked the YouTubeX.com URL, VideoDownloadX.com has been launched to avoid Google's ongoing rampage through sites with 'YouTube' based URLs, which is likelyto lead to a major upheavel amongst webmasters online.

Speaking today on the brand realignment, NAME of MindImage LLC said the move was both indicative of the growth of the service in recent times, to encompass a wider variety of media sources whilst also carrying the dual benefit of getting round the ‘YouTube’ effect.

“Google has been conducting a harsh penalisation process of websites that contain ‘YouTube’ within their name, as part of their ongoing crackdown on the independence of the Internet. Having already stolen our domain, there's no telling where else they'll strike next. Nevertheless we will continue to provide a quality service to our users without compromising what we do. YouTubeX.com is now VideoDownloadX.com, and our users can now look forward to access to files from any media site – not just from YouTube”.

VideoDownloadX.com allows users to download and save video files from a variety of media websites in order to save favourites for repeat viewing.
