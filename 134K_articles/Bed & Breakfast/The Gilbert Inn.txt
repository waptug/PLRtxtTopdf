The Gilbert Inn

A romantic Queen Anne Victorian home built in 1892, the Gilbert Inn, in Seaside, Oregon, will capture your heart and imagination at first sight.  The Gilbert Inn has an idyllic setting - being in one of the North Coast's most trendy seashore towns. Seaside, with its historic boardwalk and turnaround on the sea is a great vacation destination. Shops, restaurants, beaches, parks, museums, it's all here and within easy walking distance.

Upon entering this special Queen Anne Victorian you are transported back into yesterday. The Gilbert Inn, built in 1892, still looks much the same as it did back then, the large fireplace in the middle of the parlor; the natural fir tongue and groove ceilings and walls all through the house still hold on to their warmth and charm.

The ten guests accommodations are inspired by the classic Victorian era and mirror charm and style from the past. Every room offers lovely decor with queen sized beds, down quilts, cozy comforters, period furnishings and our family heirlooms all mingled together to make the emphasis on comfort.

The Gilbert Inn is one of the few bed and breakfast establishments that offer discounts not only to AAA members and seniors, but also to active military personnel.  All of the rooms feature private bathrooms, color television, telephones, and DVD players with complimentary DVD's available and includes a full breakfast.

The original Gilbert Cottage is now a "country style" suite and features a large bedroom, sitting room and full bath. This is the 1880's Suite.  Emma's Room has natural fir ceiling and walls frame and the cherry wood four-poster bed makes it complete. Alexander's Room features a claw-foot bathtub. The Turret Room features old fir ceilings and walls and "turret" windows. Every one of the other rooms also have their own unique features.
