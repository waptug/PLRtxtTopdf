Gardening for Kids

Here is a summer activity that can last the entire summer.  Helping the kids grow their 
own garden is fun and they will be able to reap the benefits before school starts again by 
harvesting their own vegetables.

This activity will require some pre-planning and most likely should be started before 
school is out.  The best way to start a garden for children is to germinate the seeds 
indoors.  After it is decided what type of vegetables to grow, get the plants ready inside 
so they have a better chance of success when they are moved to the outdoors.

Beans, radishes, and carrots are all easy vegetables to grow.  Strawberries are a popular 
alternative to vegetables and are also considered an easy plant to take care of.  Have the 
children make home-made row markers for their vegetable garden using paper and 
Popsicle sticks.  You can have the pictures laminated or do-it-yourself with some clear 
packing tape to protect them from rain.

Make the garden the child’s responsibility, if there is already a garden plot in your yard 
give them a section to call their own.  Most children can be in charge of their own 
weeding and watering.  This is another good activity that fosters independence and will 
give the children a sense of accomplishment come the end of the summer – eating 
vegetables that they grew themselves in their own backyard.

If fruit and vegetables do not interest your child, try a different kind of plant.  Growing 
sunflowers is very rewarding.  They can grow up to 8-12 feet tall and the seeds are 
edible.  Or, go to the garden center together and let them pick out a small plant or seeds 
that they want to take care of for the summer or maybe for longer if they pick a perennial 
plant.
