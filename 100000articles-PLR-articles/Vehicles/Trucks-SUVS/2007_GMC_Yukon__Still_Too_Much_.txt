Article Body:
I realize I may be stepping on some toes, but please hear me out. The upcoming, new from the ground up, GMC Yukon is certain to be perceived by some as being too much…in size, that is. With fuel prices at an all time high and consumer sentiment shifting to smaller vehicles will the GMC Yukon be considered outdated even before it hits showroom floors in Spring 2006? Let’s take a look at many of the changes planned for the all new Yukon and then you can decide for yourself.

General Motors has been itching to release the Yukon and a host of other full sized GMC/Chevrolet models to the public as soon as possible. Some find this odd, particularly since fuel prices are high and demand for large vehicles is on the decline. Still, there is good reason why GM wants you to take a closer look at upcoming offerings including the 2007 GMC Yukon, their big SUV:

<li> <b>New from the ground up.</b> Ask anyone who purchases large trucks and SUVs and they will tell you that owning one with the latest technology is often a deciding factor in purchasing a new model. GM is right on schedule with the update; however as with any “older model” vehicle currently on the market sales typically decline as a new model is prepared for release.

<li> <b>Engine efficiency.</b> The 2007 Yukon’s two V8s will produce greater horsepower than the previous engines, but they will register an increase in fuel economy. How so? General Motors is incorporating <b>Displacement on Demand</b> technology, which deactivates some of the cylinders at low loads for increased fuel economy. You may recall a more basic version of this technology being applied to Cadillac models in the early 1980s; that particular V8-6-4 technology was ahead of its time and GM had to pull it back then as the engines did not do what was intended for them to do. Now, more than a generation later, General Motors has worked out all the kinks and has vastly improved on the original idea.

<li> <b>Safety.</b> Roof mounted side curtain air bags will now be made available for all three rows of passengers. GM has been on a major offensive over the past half decade or more in stressing safety, a big seller for any vehicle. A better ABS system and StabiliTrak, GM’s premier handling system, will also be included.

<li> <b>Technological improvements.</b> Rear camera systems, power fold and tumble rear seats, and an improved navigation system are some of the updates. The interior of the 2007 Yukon is actually larger than preceding models.

While General Motors can only wish that fuel prices were lower, the company is hoping that each of their new models can take a greater slice of the shrinking big truck/SUV pie. With new models from Ford still a year or two away, the Yukon is poised to cut into Expedition sales as well as take back sales lost to Lexus. Even with high fuel prices in place, there will likely always be a core market of people who need a vehicle of the Yukon’s size; General Motors knows this and has updated their line of vehicles to keep pace.
