School Supplies

	Remember the line from “You’ve Got Mail” about a bouquet of sharpened pencils?  It’s time for school, and that bouquet could come in handy about now.  In years past, our school has always handed out the school supply list two days before school started.  This drove me crazy.  For one thing, it only gave me one day to go get what my kids needed for the first day, and for another thing, the school sales were over.
	So I’ve started stockpiling school supplies.  Once you have had your kids in school, you get a feel for the supplies that the school generally needs.  Our elementary school is very big on glue sticks.  Gone are the days when you took a bottle of Elmer’s glue and had it refilled when you got low.  Glue sticks are the way to go, less mess, easier to use, and no big globs of glue that take two days to dry.  I have a big pile of extra glue sticks that I bought when they went on sale.  
	Watch whatever items your children use.  These are good items to find on sale and pick up before school starts.  The summer before school starts is the only time I’ve seen school supplies on sale so make sure you take advantage of it.
	Some schools and teachers accept donations for other items used in the classroom.  You can check with the teachers and find out what items they are in need of.  This is a great way to help out the teacher.  
	When the kids come home with their supply lists now, we sit down and go through my stash and check off the things we have, and what we still need.  If you keep your supply filled, there shouldn’t be a need for the quick dash to the store on the day before school starts.
