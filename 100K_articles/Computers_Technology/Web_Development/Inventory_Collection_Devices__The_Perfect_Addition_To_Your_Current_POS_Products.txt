Are you a retailer? If you are in the business of operating a profitable retail store, such as a supermarket or a department store, no matter how large or small your establishment is, you are. When it comes to running a retail store or even a chain of them, many retailers look for ways to decrease costs, but increase profits. If you are one of those retailers, you likely already use POS products in your stores, but did you know that you could also be doing more?

Before examining the additional products that can be used in conjunction with POS products, it is first important to examine what POS products are. POS products are pieces of equipment that are used in retail settings to assist with the sale of a customer. At the same time, many POS products also help to keep inventory counts. For instance, if a customer were to buy a comforter set, that comforter set, once scanned at the register, would automatically be deducted from the on hand comforter set inventory count. When the on hand count gets low enough, your stores could reorder more comforter sets or they may even be sent to your store automatically, depending on how your orders are processed and received.

If you are like many retail chains, particularly those who use POS products, including POS cash registers, there is a good chance that your store orders are automatically generated. POS products can be networked together, between different stores, corporate offices, as well as distribution centers. This networking is what makes many POS products, including POS cash registers, work to their fullest potential. When a POS product is working to the best of its ability, it lessens the amount of work that you and your employees have to do, saving you time and money.

Despite the possibility to automatically generate orders for your stores, there are some POS products, including POS cash registers, which need assistance. If you have been in the retail industry for long, you already know that cashier errors and shoplifting are frowned upon, but common. Unfortunately, that part of the business may be disrupting your inventory counts generated by a POS cash register barcode scanner. To eliminate errors and keep an accurate count of inventory, you will want to look into to purchasing other equipment; equipment that can supplement POS products, including POS cash registers. One piece of equipment that you may want to look into outfitting your stores with is referred to as an inventory collection device.

Inventory collection devices come in a number of different makes and models; however, they are most commonly handheld machines. These handheld machines, installed with the correct software, can assist you with keeping an accurate inventory count. This can be done a number of different ways. For instance, if a number of retail stores or retail stores chains are involved, someone from headquarters could initiate a mandatory on hand inventory account. Often times, when this is done, a specific number of items, in a specific department, are counted, but other times, stores are given the freedom to randomly count a number of products; any products that they choose. Inventory collection devices and on hand inventory counts will help to ensure that your stores are fully stocked with the appropriate amount of merchandise.

Inventory collection devices, when paired with other POS products, like POS cash registers; give the option to retain the largest profits possible. For instance, if too little inventory is in your stores, your customers may be unable to find what they need in stock and turn to one of your competitors. Should too much inventory be in your stores, it makes your business a prime target for those with poor intentions; intentions that include shoplifting. In this aspect, inventory control devices can cut down on your loses; thus, generating additional profits. Many established retailers, like you, find that their inventory control devices, as well as all of the POS products, pay for themselves in as little as a few weeks.
