Bug Bingo

Don’t worry; this doesn’t involve catching bugs just finding them.  You will need a piece 
of paper for each child that is playing, crayons or pencils and stickers.  Divide each piece 
of paper into nine squares with three columns and three rows.  The middle square is a free 
space.

In each of the other eight squares draw a picture or write the name of a bug that can be 
found in your backyard.  Send the children out with the stickers and their bingo cards to 
find the bugs.  As the child finds each bug they can place a sticker on the appropriate 
square.  The only rule that should be reinforced is that the bugs are not to be touched (or 
squashed, squished, etc.).

To make the game longer or shorter you can either have the children find all the bugs on 
the page to win or like in traditional bingo the first person to make a line on their card 
wins.  Once you put the effort into the game cards you may want to spend a bit of extra 
time and money to have them laminated.  They can be re-used over and over again.  
When they are laminated you can choose to use a marker or crayon instead of stickers to 
check off the bugs that are found.

A good list of bugs to put on the cards:

*	Ladybug
*	Ant
*	Caterpillar
*	Worm
*	Bee
*	Spider
*	Wood louse
*	Beetle
*	Butterfly
*	Any other bug or insect that can be easily found in your yard.

Different variations of this game include using leaves or flowers instead of bugs.  A prize 
for winning the game can increase the fun for the kids.  It doesn’t have to candy or a toy, 
even letting them decide what video to watch or have for dinner can be enough of a prize 
for a child.
