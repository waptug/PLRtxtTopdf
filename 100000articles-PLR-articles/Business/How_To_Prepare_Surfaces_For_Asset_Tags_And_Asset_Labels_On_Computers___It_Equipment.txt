In past articles we have talked about what asset labels or asset tags are and who should be using them. This article is designed to show people the best method of applying asset labels or asset tags.

Failure to follow these instructions could mean that the labels will not work as expected.

The most important element of applying any kind of security adhesive based identification device is the cleanliness of the surface. The surface needs to be free of dirt and especially any oils or grease as this will prevent a good bond ever being achieved.

I have found that the best method of doing this is simply to clean the surface with an alcohol wipe. You can buy sachets quite cheaply. You simply open the sachet by tearing the top open and take the alcohol cloth out. Then, gently rub the area of the equipment where you intend to apply the label.

You will find that the alcohol may take 30 seconds to evaporate, however when this has completed the surface should be free of any contaminants.

Now, as these labels are highly tacky you need to make sure you get the label on straight because, in some grades of materials - especially the void material and the destructible, it is impossible to reposition them without damaging them.

Sometimes I recommend you mark out the corners with a little marker pen so you have a rough idea of it being on “square” - note, only do this before you wipe with alcohol as the ink in the pen itself may prevent the adhesive from grabbing.

The next stage is to wait. With vinyl destructible I’d recommend 2 hours for 40% strength, 1 day for 60% strength and 3 days for 100% strength. It really does take that long for the adhesive to cure.

I hope this has helped.
