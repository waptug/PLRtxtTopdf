A large proportion of the American public goes to work every day in an office environment without considering the ergonomics of the equipment they use. There are large a proportion of people working at a desk without giving due consideration to proper ergonomics as they work with ergonomically incorrect keyboards and mice. Working at a computer on a regular basis can cause the same type of stress on your body as other physical labors and in an effort to prevent such injuries from occurring, companies need to consider the principles of ergonomics. 

The type of injuries found on those working on a computer can be found in different places — in areas like the hands, wrists, arms, back, etc. These repeated stress injuries get worse over time because many people don’t know what’s causing them, they don’t understand what ergonomics is and they don’t do anything about it until the injury has become a permanent fixture of pain.

This is where having the proper workplace equipment can play its role and the benefits of using ergonomically correct mice and keyboards makes a real difference. By finding office products that are ergonomically correct, you can have the peace of mind that goes with knowing you are using the proper equipment to avoid any office-related repetitive stress injuries. 

Items that can assist in developing a more ergonomically friendly workplace are:

-Arm Supports

-Keyboards

-Cursor Controls

-Zero Tension Mice

-Keypads and more

Finding the ergonomically correct items for your office will not only help to stave off stress injuries, but will also add to the efficiency of your office environment. You will be relaxed, in proper position and instead of being focused on how uncomfortable you are you can simply concentrate on the work tasks at hand.

For those who use a mouse for much of the day, an arm support is just the thing to support your arm and your shoulder while you are working. For instance, a proper arm support alleviates stress on your spine and allows you to keep your wrist aligned. The benefit of using an arm support is that you are able to be just as efficient, while keeping everything aligned correctly and avoiding the strains that cause things like Carpal Tunnel Syndrome or Repetitive Stress Injury. 

The benefit of using an ergonomic keyboard is that for those who do a lot of typing in their workplace environment, the right keyboard can lessen the stress put on the wrist and hand when typing. A keyboard with wider margin of space will keep the hands in a more natural position. A keyboard that utilizes a split design does away with any twisting of the wrist and tilted keys and pads can help to minimize any tension in the hand/wrist area.

Another beneficial, ergonomically correct product is an ergonomically correct dream mouse. A mouse with a grip-less design lifts the pressure of having to grip a mouse all day and it means that your hand and wrist are supported at all times, no matter how you move the mouse. Another mouse that would work for an ergonomically correct workstation is a zero-tension mouse. A zero-tension mouse provides the user with a comfortable working environment with a design that offers a scroll wheel button, right and left mouse button. A zero-tension mouse works for small and medium hands and is the perfect complement to an ergonomic keyboard. 

The benefits of using ergonomically correct mice and keyboards and other workplace equipment can be measured by:

-How comfortable you are when working

-How efficient you are able to be when using office equipment

-How the various types of equipment affect your overall body, not just hands or arms, but back, legs, neck, etc.

-The number of workplace incidences involving Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and/or Repetitive Stress Injury

Finally, there are a number of items that you can use to assist in building a workspace that is as ergonomically correct as possible. By utilizing keyboards, mice, arm support and more, you can avoid dealing with multiple instances of stress syndromes around the target areas — wrists, hands, back — that are most vulnerable when working in an ergonomically incorrect environment.
