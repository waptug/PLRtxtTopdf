A Day at the Beach

Visions of summer will eventually lead to a day at the beach.  It can be at a lake, the 
ocean, or any sandy area you can find but it no matter what it will be a day to remember.  
There are many activities that can be done on a beach day, or just go to have fun and 
relax.  By being prepared for a few different scenarios you are sure to have a great time.

The most important part of beach day is safety.  There is water safety – no child should 
go into the water alone or without adult supervision.  And there is stranger safety, most 
beaches are quite crowded on a nice summer day, it is always a good idea to review 
stranger safety before going out to a crowded public place.

The standards supplies to bring on any beach day include sunscreen, towels, water, and 
pails and shovels.  There are more things that you could use and always remember to err 
on the side of caution.  If you think you might need it and have room, bring it along.

If there isn’t a natural place to be in the shade in the form of a tree, something should be 
brought for the children to have a break in.  A beach umbrella or a tent for the kids is a 
smart choice.

Children know instinctively how to have fun especially on a beach.  Building sandcastles, 
digging holes, collecting seashells are all part of traditional beach fun.  A beach 
scavenger hunt will keep them busy too.  Not to mention the swimming.  Don’t forget to 
keep reapplying the sunscreen and have the children keep on their hats – even in the 
water.

The beach may be a once in a summer trip or you may be able to go every week but 
either way it will be a summer activity they will fondly remember.
