Freshness of the Drink
A cup of coffee should be enjoyed fresh and if possible it should be as fresh as the day it was grounded.  Traditional coffee making involving beans roasted and grounded at home to have that fresh flavor can sometimes turn into a disaster.  Coffee beans should never be roasted too long as it can loose its natural flavor and can bring out a burnt flavor instead.  When grinding coffee beans, it should be just right so as not to loose the coffee beans essential oils that bring out the rich flavor and aroma.

This container also keeps out oxygen, mildew, moisture and light and keeps essential oils inside.

After combining the cup with hot water, this can give you a coffee that is fresh in aroma and flavor as if it were right out of the farm.
