Article Body:
As women today, it's all too easy to let our sensuality wane. After all, we have demanding careers, kids who need our love and attention, and a million errands to run and chores to do. The intimate relationships we have with our husbands or boyfriends often take a backseat to the activities that make up our life. It doesn't take much, though, to rediscover our sensuality and reignite our passion - some sizzling hot lingerie will do the trick almost every time. 

You don't have to be Shirley of Hollywood or memorize the Kama Sutra to add some spice to your love life. You really just need a bit of time, some privacy, and some sizzling hot lingerie. 

Time

No one ever has enough time, so you have to make it a point to carve out some time for you and your husband to be together. If you don't have kids, it's relatively easy to set aside one night a month for "date night." If you do have kids, well, that's why grandparents were invented. A sleepover at grandma's, your sister's house, or a good friend's house will give you and your mate an opportunity to have a leisurely evening, night, and morning alone. That should rekindle the flames!

Privacy

Privacy is paramount when it comes to a successful date night. That means more than tucking the kids away at a relative's house. It also means a commitment to spending the evening without interruption: an agreement to not answer the house phone, turn off your cell phones, and resist the temptation to sneak off to check your email. If you don't think that's possible, consider spending the night at a local hotel. You may only be a few miles from home, but it will give you the psychological space to truly relax and enjoy yourself. 

Sizzling Hot Lingerie

There's no denying that men are visual creatures, and some sexy lingerie will go a long way to rekindle the passion you share. Surprise him by "slipping into something more comfortable" and coming out in a bustier, corset, baby doll, or camisole. You never know - he may have a few ideas of his own and be wearing men's sexy underwear, have rose petals sprinkled on the bed, or have flavored massage oil on the nightstand. 

Regularly Indulging Your Sensuality

Every woman knows how hard it is to switch roles at a moment's notice. It's difficult to fix dinner, get the kids bathed and put to bed, and then - snap - turn into a seductress. Try too hard, and you'll either give up or start resenting your mate. 

One of the things that makes it easier to kindle the passion that you and your husband share is to regularly indulge your sensuality. That might mean carving out some alone time to go on a walk by yourself, to take a bubble bath, or to have a regular manicure and pedicure. It can also mean wearing lingerie everyday that makes you feel sensuous. Your co-workers don't need to know that you're wearing a sexy bra and panty set under your business suit, or that you're wearing stockings and garters instead of pantyhose. Your husband doesn't even have to know. The important thing is that you'll know, and that you'll carry an awareness of your sensuality with you throughout the day. Over time, you'll find it much easier to switch from mommy to lover at the end of the day. And when you do, you'll have your sizzling hot lingerie to show off to your husband.
