So you want to buy a Nintendo Wii? You have heard about all of the new features, and what it has to offer a professional gamer like yourself. The good thing for you is that the Nintendo Wii is highly anticipated, and should not have any problems living up to the hype. On the other side of things there is a major drawback that you will have to contend with. Since the Wii has a lot of hype surrounding it, it is safe to say that you will have to get darn lucky to secure a system when it arrives in stores in the United States on November 19.

If you are interested in buying a Wii you may want to take the time to find out if there is a way to reserve a unit. Many stores all over the United States are taking advanced orders for the new Wii. If you can get onto one of these lists you will not have to worry about getting shut out when the time comes.

On the other side of things, you may want to be a bit more risky and wait in line for the new Nintendo Wii to go on sale. There is a good chance that since this unit is so greatly anticipated that there will be long lines of people waiting to suck them up. Unfortunately, some of these people will be doing nothing more than buying a unit just to resell it on eBay a few days later.

And speaking of eBay, if you want to buy a Wii you should consider this option. The bottom line is that with these units moving so fast you may not have an easy time finding one in a store near you. This means that if you really want to get your hands on one you will have to look for alternative options. And the best way to go may be using eBay. The only drawback of eBay is that you will have to spend much more money than the retail price. The people who buy several units in the stores will mark them up and then try to sell on eBay for a large profit. And the fact of the matter is that since there is such a high demand, prices on eBay will begin to climb the second that they hit the market place.

If you want to buy a Wii you may have to get creative, or quite possibly wait a few months until the demand dies down a bit. The bottom line is that if you do not buy a Wii in the stores, you will have to resort to an auction site like eBay. And when you do this you will run into the issue of paying more than you would in a store.

All of the hype and demand for the Nintendo Wii is becoming quite interesting. It will be even more fun to see how things shake out as far as buying the Wii is concerned.
