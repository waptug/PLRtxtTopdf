Here are five key features of electronic signature pads that you may want to become familiar with.

Most electronic signature pads are priced below $500. While this may seem a bit steep, one of these should be able to last for quite a long time. So before you pass up this modern technology for a lesser solution, you should really consider what you are getting for the price that you pay.
