In the middle of the Arboretum sits the four acre Baldwin Lake which has been used in filming numerous movies and television shows. "Johnny Weissmuller swam in LASCA Lagoon/Baldwin Lake for three decades as Tarzan and later Jungle Jim. A local news story reported that he, in fact, set an unrecorded Olympic swim record when a cage of crocodiles was accidentally opened during filming (Weissmuller beat the crocs to the lake shore). Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour took up a month-long watery Baldwin Lake residence in homes on stilts for the filming of Road to Singapore in 1939, the same year the Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.,/Madeleine Carroll film Safari managed to sink a paddlewheel boat in the same lake. Undaunted, television's original "Fantasy Island" lowered a pontoon plane by helicopter onto Baldwin Lake and propelled it across the water to disembark visitors to Mr. Roark's island paradise. For Alex Haley's "Roots II", Baldwin Lake became Kunta Kinte's river home in Africa."<br><br>
Don’t just peek through the windows of the Arboretum’s Queen Anne Cottage, come inside to see the historic Treasures! The cottage, with its marble terrace, Victorian furnishings and treasures provides a charming opportunity for the whole family.<br><br>
Take the tram or walk through the gardens, spend the day being mesmerized by all of the well tended plants, flowers, flowering trees, cacti, succulents and the abundant wildlife (The Arboretum is famous for it's roaming peafowl.). The rose gardens alone are worth the visit. Stop and watch a wedding or see a commercial being filmed. Take your kids to the Discovery Node constructed out by Tule Pond, you'll find a variety of new activities for children of all ages to enjoy and explore. Eat at the Peacock Cafe. Sit down on a bench or under a tree, relax and feel your cares floating away.<br><br>
Visit the gift shop where you can buy plants, gardening books, photographs, paintings and other items (the prices are very inexpensive.).<br><br>
