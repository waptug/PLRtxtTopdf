Market Spice originated from Seattle’s Historic Pike Place market in 1911. Market spice is made from sweet huckleberries, which is what gives Market Spice it’s “unlike anything else” taste. Don’t be confused with Huckleberry Finn how ever I’m sure if Tom Sawyer was to drink tea it would be Market Spice. Only Market Spice packs the type of punch that an adventurer like Tom Sawyer would be satisfied with. I’ve heard it compared to Orange on Steroids. How ever you look at the Tea, The taste is something else and leads to a simply unforgettable experience.

Market spice has been converting Green tea drinkers for almost 100 years. Why Market Spice? Words can't do any more justice: If there is an adventurer in you: Try it and find out for yourself!
