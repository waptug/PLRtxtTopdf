Wooden bar stools offer quality what ever location they are in, either in the bar or home. A good bar stool design is one that has a padded seat or removable cushion, as comfort is the name of the game and of course a bar stool that can blend into any back ground or interior.

Most items of furniture manufactured from wood in many instances will complement almost any room. Think about the décor or themes you have employed in the past. Whether it’s traditional, country, uptown apartment, wooden bar stools really can fit in to most places.

In traditionally designed rooms, darker woods or more complex design on bar stool legs or back rests will supply the affluent, yet comfortable design most at home in traditional styles. Padded seats or detachable cushions in deep vibrant colours will set nicely with most decors.

With modern décor, bright or darkened wooden bar stools work well together in their respective light and dark back grounds. Some wooden bar stools also use metal trims in their fabrics, this has the advantage of making the bar stools very modern looking.

If you want to incorporate wooden bar stools into a country styled décor, a 2 tone designed stool is what you are looking for and has stood the test of time and looks like it will continue for the foreseeable future. You can buy wooden bar stools with 2 coats of paint or just have the 1 coat to improve and harmonize the innate wood finish. Light woods and white or hunter green are the most popular. A deeper colour or rosewood finish can make an off-white colour finish fit in to the sheikest of interiors.

Wooden bar stools are strong and can endure a lot of what gets thrown at them and will adapt to many decors. Wooden bar stools are the most versatile of all the different varieties of bar stool designs. Metal bar stools can’t really fit in to any décor that isn’t up market or post modern. When buying your bar stools don’t presume that you will have the same house or keep to the decoration plan so choose the style carefully. It's much more logical to invest in furniture that will last for ages. Wooden bar stools will be around no matter what trends hit your home. A simple change of upholstery or change of chair pad, and your wooden stools have had a makeover!
