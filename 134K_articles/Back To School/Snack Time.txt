Snack Time

	The kids are home from school.  They haven’t had anything to eat since lunch time three hours ago.  They are starving.  Will they reach for the bag of potato chips, or find some fruit wedges and dip?  Helping our kids eat nutrition snacks is easy if they are the only choice.  Don’t buy the junk foods at the store and your children won’t have to resist eating them.  Here are some fun ideas for snack time at home.
	Kids love to dip.  Make foods that they can dip with.  Vegetables are a given, but fruits are also good with a fruit dip.  You can make one using some whipping cream and jello mix.  This sounds really sweet and sugary, but you are getting them to eat fruit as well.  Limit their dip to a spoonful so they don’t put too much on each piece.
	Adding creativity to the display or cut of the food makes it fun to eat.  You can slice apples and cut them into bites and serve them with toothpicks or skewers.  Add bites of bananas or other fruits between the apple bites.  
	Fast snacks are another choice.  Bagels with peanut butter, rice cakes, fruit,  nutrition bars, granola bars, and fruit rollups are some quick ideas.  Add a glass of fruit juice and your kids will be set.  
	There are lots of recipes that you can find for your kid’s after school snack.  If you don’t have time to bake during the day, make a batch of cookies or other snack on the weekend and freeze the dough or the cooked food.  Then before the kids get home from school, pull it out of the freezer and let it thaw, or cook it.  Providing nutritious snacks gives your kids the energy they need to make it to dinner time.
