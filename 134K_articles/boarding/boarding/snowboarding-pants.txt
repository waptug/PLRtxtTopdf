Tips When Buying Snowboarding Pants

Like any piece of al fresco sports’ wear, snowboarding pants serves one main purpose and that is to ensure your protection from injury, weather conditions, and any other external force.  There is generally an accepted method to maintain your core temperature and prevent you from cooling off easily and this is known as the   Three Layer System. This system is composed of a base layer, an insulation layer and an outer shell. The base layer is the only layer directly in contact with your skin and its sole purpose is to turn the moisture away from the skin. On top of the base layer lies the insulation layer which is also intended to get rid of moisture away from the body but its more important function is to insulate your body by confining your body heat. The outer shell is the layer directly exposed to the environment. It is expected to be waterproof, windproof and has also a breathable outlet for moisture.

Most snowboarding pants combine 2 or contain all the 3 layers in one piece. Most will also have waterproofing, a thin outer shell, and an efficient insulation layer.. During warmer conditions, you have the option to wear only the snowboarding pants. Meanwhile, when the weather turns colder, you can add a base layer bottom beneath your snowboarding pants. However, when the weather goes extremely cold, have the liberty to wear all three layers while wearing a layer of extra insulation between the base layer of your bottoms and your snowboarding pants. 

Before buying your snowboarding pants, consider these tips.

-You need to anticipate a few rough falls. So, one important aspect that you need to look for snowboarding pants is extra padding especially on the knee and buttocks area since these are the parts that commonly catch your plunges. Having extra padding will not give you enough protection to minimize the chance of any injury plus the possibility of getting your pants damaged thus losing their waterproof capacity.
