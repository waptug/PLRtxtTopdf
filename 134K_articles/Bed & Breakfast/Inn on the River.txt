Inn on the River

An extraordinary visit awaits you at the Inn on the River in Glen Rose, Texas.  We all know Texans like to do everything in a big way and this extends to their hospitality. It is a place where the constant flow of interruptions is replaced by a quietly flowing river, and the harsh sounds of city traffic give way to those of singing birds.

The Inn, which is selected as a Texas Historical Landmark, is stylishly furnished to make available the ultimate in comfort.  No two rooms are the same, but every one is beautifully decorated with an historic armoire, excellent European linens, a feather bed and a goose-down comforter.  Each and every one of the rooms has a private bath.  And, you will find irresistible the fact that the rooms do not have televisions to inundate you with the news of everyday life.

When it is time to have a little excitement, take a plunge in the mineral water pool, play croquet or volleyball, cruise around town on one of the mountain bikes, or simply sit by the river and slow down for a while. Bird watching from the Adirondack chairs overlooking the river is a much loved pastime of Inn on the River guests. Binoculars and bird watchers' guides are accessible. The Glen Rose Sanctuary is just a short walk away.

The Glen Rose region offers a broad assortment of leisure opportunities, including the Bird Watching Sanctuary, Fossil Rim Wildlife Center, Dinosaur Valley State Park, The Brazos River, which is perfect for canoeing and fishing, horseback riding, fishing or boating on Lake Granbury and antique shopping.

Don't allow a visit to Texas pass without spending at least one day at the Inn on the River. It may not be your most exciting stop, but it will certainly be one of your best.
