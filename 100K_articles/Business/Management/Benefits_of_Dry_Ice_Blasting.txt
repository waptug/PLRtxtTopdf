Article Body:
<b>Cleans More Thoroughly</b>

Dry ice blasting can effectively and easily clean and reach places that other methods cannot. Like reaching nooks and crannies that are difficult to reach with brushes or chemicals
 

<b>Saves time</b>

In dry ice blasting, equipments are cleaned on site. There is no need of transporting the equipment to some other place for cleaning. 
It saves a lot of precious time and reduces any chances of damaging equipment during disassembly and reduces the stress and fatigue of workers. And most importantly, it can shorten the downtime for cleaning from several hours to days.


<b>No Chances of Damage</b>

Cleaning method such as sand blasting can remove part of the surface or at times drastically changing the appearance of the equipment. 
On the other hand, <a href=http://www.react365.com/dry-ice-blasting.php>dry ice blasting services</a> is a non-abrasive form of cleaning which does not cause any harm to the equipment. When the dry ice pellets hit the surface, they become soft and sublimate and lift the contaminants away.
Secondly, it also reduces the chance of any further damage by eliminating the step of taking the equipment to and from the cleaning area.
 

<b>Non Toxic</b>

Dry ice blasting doesn’t involve the use of any solvents. It uses harmless CO2 pellets. This method is quite beneficial for companies which have to comply with the environmental regulations. This method minimizes health risks of employees, ensures their safety and also ensures a clean and safe environment.
 

<b>No Extra Waste Disposal</b>

In sand blasting or some other methods, the cleaning agent becomes the additional contaminant along with the primary contaminant.

<b>No Need for Extra Space</b>

Dry ice blasting units are portable. They are taken to the place where the equipments are located; thereby sparing the headache of moving the equipments to some cleaning site.
 

<b>Dry Cleaning Process</b>

The process doesn’t involve the use of chemical solvents, lubricants and water. Thus, it makes for an ideal cleaning method for electrical equipments or other water sensitive applications.
 

<b>Bacterial Prevention</b>

Dry ice retards the growth of bacteria and fungus as it is -109 degrees F. This temperature is sufficient to kill the bacteria and fungi present there.
