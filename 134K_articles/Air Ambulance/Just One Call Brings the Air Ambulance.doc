}Just One Call Brings the Air Ambulance\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 If you or
 someone you love have been seriously injured or become ill away from home, it is
 important to return home safely and quickly.  Patients recover better and faster
 when in familiar surroundings and near family.  If travel arrangements must be 
made by air ambulance, then just pick up the phone.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 One simple
 call to an air ambulance service center will get the ball rolling and soon the 
air ambulance will be on its way to the patient.  Operators are available 24 hours
 a day, 7 days a week, 365 days per year at most air ambulance service centers.  
Patients don\u8217\'92t wait until banker\u8217\'92s hours to get hurt or sick, 
so the air ambulance service industry is always ready to take the call.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The phone
 call comes into the center and the operator will quickly take down the important
 details and information needed to begin scheduling the trip.  The staff takes the
 information and processes the rest of the arrangements.  There are no other hassles
 or concerns for the patient or the family.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 A medical
 coordinator at the air ambulance service will begin by looking at the request for
 air ambulance service information, then call or contact the appropriate hospital
, doctor, or medical facility where the patient is currently located.  After speaking
 to someone about the specific details of the case, the medical coordinator gets
 to work.  The medical coordinator has quite a job to do.  Not only do they have
 to keep up on the patient\u8217\'92s condition but also learn about any potential
 complications that may arise during transit.  It is important for the medical coordinator
 to accurately record any in-flight orders and relay this information to the flight
 team.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Now that 
the medical coordinator is informed and briefed on the situation, it is time to 
notify the flight crew and medical staff.  The personnel on board the air ambulance
 must be highly qualified to care for the patient and the specified needs that may
 arise during the flight.  All pilots and crew members must also be informed about
 the patient\u8217\'92s medical condition and needs.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Although 
the air ambulance always has standard medical equipment on board, there are times
 when specialized medical tools and equipment must be loaded onto the aircraft to
 monitor and treat the patient appropriately during the flight.  Each patient is
 promised bedside to bedside treatment, so all equipment must be ready and well-
maintained in order to jet off to the patient in a moment\u8217\'92s notice.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 As the aircraft
 is checked and ready for flight, the air ambulance service staff is filing flight
 plans and assessing weather information.  Not only is it important to get the plane
 to the point of origin of the patient, but also to the destination.  The goal of
 the air ambulance service is to transport the patient safely, quickly, and comfortably
.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The ground
 transportation of the patient must also be coordinated.  The medical coordinator
 contacts the appropriate ground transportation crews and informs them of the patient
\u8217\'92s circumstances and time of arrival.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 All of this
 intense effort and coordination comes together quickly and efficiently to get the
 patient to the destination safely and hassle free.  It only takes one phone call
 to get the air ambulance on the way.  The rest is up to the air ambulance service
. \par}
