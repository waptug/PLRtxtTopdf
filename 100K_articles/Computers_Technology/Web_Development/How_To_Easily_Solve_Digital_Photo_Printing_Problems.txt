What will you do if you have digital photo printing problems? There are some who say that we the common users make a mistake by doing searches and trying to fix such digital photo printing problems by ourselves because we could get things worse. Some say that the problem should be left to professionals. Well, I’m not accepting something like that and I think nobody should, if you have a problem with your digital photo printing, I find it normal to analyze the situation and try to solve it by yourself before calling the service and giving them a nice sum of money for nothing.

One of the most common digital photo printing problems is related to “ink troubles”. Some new printers like the ones made by Canon, Epson or Hewlett – Packard work at their best only with original ink, so don’t expect to have outstanding results when you are using some cheap stuff. This brand-named ink is not very expensive, but it makes a difference on high detail photos appearance.  I’m not referring to some text printing, because for printing large quantities of text, third party inks are ok. Digital photo printing problems occur; as such photos require high quality materials.

Now let’s refer to paper for what the digital photo printing problems are concerned. For regular use normal inkjet paper is ok, you don’t need something else, but when printing photos or high quality pictures use glossy photo paper that is especially created to absorb ink, unlike regular paper. This should put digital photo printing problems away. Another tip to avoid digital photo printing problems is to always live the printer on. When it is powered up the printer keeps its printing heads clean. Do this even if you’re not planning to use it and also don’t make a habit of switching the printer on and off because you will lose ink. 

Running utilities that came with the printer is another good thing to do from time to time (monthly) and if you don’t have something like this go on the producer website and look for helpful programs to download. On producer sites you will find the product manual to help you deal better with digital photo printing problems. Be careful to send enough pixels to the printer, the optimal number should be no less then 200 pixels per inch, but I recommend 300 for best results. Also consider waiting for the ink to dry, there are producers that specify up to 24 hours of waiting before placing the picture into a glass or plastic frame. Such digital photo printing problems usually occur with some glossy special paper but it’s not a certain rule. Constant care will ensure the best digital photo printing results.
