Clifton - The Country Inn

Charlottesville, Virginia, is home to the elegantly landscaped grounds of Clifton - The Country Inn.  This 1799 country inn exudes southern refinement with its uniquely decorated rooms and gracious service.  

Every one of the fourteen of the room are filled with antiques, have wood burning fireplaces and views of the manicured grounds and private lake.  A complimentary full breakfast will start any visitor's day off on a positive note, as will the coffee that is available in each and every room.  Activities include a pool, whirlpool, lawn games and lighted tennis courts.  Clifton also offers in-room massages, custom picnic baskets and private dinners in their gazebo.

The seven rooms and suites situated in the main house are extremely comfy, yet stylish. The diverse, but equally striking, views from these rooms include Monticello Mountain, cascading waterfalls at the pool, and gorgeous lawns and flowering gardens. These rooms are furnished with antique stuff, Waterworks fixtures and spa jet showers. All rooms offer the finest in modern amenities including high-speed Internet access. The facilities are totally non-smoking.

Clifton's three Livery Cottages were fashioned from an original dependency on the property. The building offers a huge deck, ideal for taking in the view of the private lake. Each of these rooms features a separate sitting area and exceptional antique soaking tubs in the restrooms.

If you choose to wander off the grounds, you can take a tour of Monticello, go horseback riding, enjoy a walking tour of the historic downtown Charlottesville area, take in a game of golf or do some rafting.  The possibilities are endless.  One thing you won't want to miss is a tour of the multitude of vineyards in the area.  This tour alone is a day long event and well worth the time.  Some of the state's finest vineyards call this area home.
