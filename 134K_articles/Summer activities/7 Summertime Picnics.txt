Summertime Picnics

Summertime, kids, and picnics are meant to go together.  Having a picnic doesn’t have to 
be reserved for a day out at the beach or park.  Kids love to eat outside, especially if it 
means they don’t have to stop playing to come inside and get cleaned up.  If you are 
going to have a picnic during an outing, be sure to practice food safety and have icepacks 
in with the food or cooler.

Picnics can be as simple and easy as peanut butter and jam sandwiches with apples to as 
complicated as fried chicken and potato salad.  It all depends on how much time you have 
and the preferences of those you will be serving.  But whatever you make, let the kids 
help you prepare.  

If your little ones are active, you can prepare a picnic that consists of all finger foods.  Let 
the kids come and go as they please have a snack here and there as they need it.  Some 
easy finger foods for a picnic include:

*	Cheese and crackers
*	Vegetable sticks (carrots, tomatoes, and cucumber)
*	Ants and dirt (fill celery sticks with peanut butter and top with raisins)
*	Fruit 
*	Deli meat
*	Hard boiled eggs

Even if none of your children are in diapers anymore, having baby wipes or another wet 
wipe on hand after a picnic is necessary.  They help with clean-up before and after eating.  
They also can do double-duty to clean off the picnic table at a park before you use it.  
Paper plates are practical but if you use them a lot they are an added expense – you can 
pick up a plastic picnic set that is easy to wash and can be used over and over throughout 
the summer.

Not nice enough outside for a picnic?  Who says you can’t have one indoors too!
