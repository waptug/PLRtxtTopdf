Knott's Berry Farm, America's first theme park, is located at 8039 Beach Boulevard, Buena Park, CA 90620, telephone number (714) 220-5200 and has over one hundred fifty (150) rides in six themed areas: Ghost Town, Fiesta Village®, The Boardwalk, Indian Trails, Wild Water Wilderness® and Camp Snoopy which is the official home of Snoopy and the Peanuts characters. The park is home to the high-flying 3,125 foot Silver Bullet roller coaster which sends riders climbing to a height of 146 feet and soaring back down an initial drop of 109 feet. It has a top speed of fifty five (55) miles per hour and riders will experience spirals, corkscrews, a cobra roll, and overbanked curves. It is also home to the 118 foot tall GhostRider, one of the longest and tallest wooden roller coasters in the world with a 108-foot initial banked drop, 13 additional drops, sudden dips, banked turns and maximum G-forces of 3.14<br><br>
Wild Water Wilderness is home to Bigfoot Rapids which "is a thrilling, outdoor whitewater river raft ride that will bounce, toss, spin and splash passengers as they brave fast moving currents and dodge soaring geisers as they experience the unforgettable fun of shooting the rapids". Towering cliffs, huge boulders, cascading water falls, soaring geysers and trees, shrubs and wild flowers--all indigenous to California--combine to create an authentic setting for Bigfoot Rapids. <br><br>
At Camp Snoopy, the whole family can enjoy many of the rides, "made for the young and the young-at-heart. Ride our new Charlie Brown Speedway, or Woodstock's Airmail (the kid-size version of Supreme Scream®), have the kids take you for a spin at Rocky Road Truckin' Company, or check out Timberline Twister the smallest of our rollercoaster family".<br><br>
The park holds numerous restaurants and shops and has it's own first class hotel, The Knott’s Berry Farm Resort Hotel, which offers a variety of packages to suit your needs, including Snoopy themed rooms for children where Snoopy himself will visit and provide "tuck in" service.<br><br>
Check out Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant, where 20,000,000 guests have eaten Mrs. Knott's traditional chicken dinners. "Each dinner is made from the "just-right" plump birds she insisted upon, and the fixin’s still include lighter-than-air buttermilk biscuits, fluffy mashed potatoes, rich chicken gravy and mouth-watering farm-fresh vegetables". The menu features other items as well including various lunch and dinner entrees, soups, salads, sandwiches and a complete Farm breakfast featuring French toast, pancakes, and daily specials.<br><br>
Knott's Berry Farm is an amusement park and resort for the whole family, try it.
