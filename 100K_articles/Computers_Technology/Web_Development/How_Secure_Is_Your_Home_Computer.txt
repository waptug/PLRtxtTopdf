With the popularity of and the reliance on the Internet by almost the entire world population, there are suddenly a lot of things you can do and know with literally one click of the mouse. Making purchases nowadays doesn’t require you to go to the shop or store; you can buy items online. Researching for various pieces of information can now be accomplished via the Internet.

However, there is an unfortunate reality that goes along with the wonders of the Internet. It also thanks to the Internet that computer security is always an issue. With the continued growth of the dependency of people (including businessmen, offices, government officials, and more) on computers and the Internet, this is a more important issue than what most believe.

If you are a home computer user, you still need to make sure that your computer is safe from any form of malicious online attack, including hacking. You might have important data (including any identification) in your computer which intruders can have access to. That being said, it is important for you to find out just how safe your computer is from these potential attacks.

The very first step before actually tinkering with your computer is finding out the motive of intruders and why they target home computer users. They do this because (1) home computer users typically don’t have security measures installed to counter them, which makes them easy targets; and (2) they often have valuable information stored that is enough to entice these intruders, such as credit card information. Think about it – you might potentially be a target. The registry keeps growing when you use Windows. As it does, it attracts obsolete information and becomes cluttered.

Following that, you have to know what types of attack to expect – it is usually via email or clicking an ad-banner on a website. Opening an unknown, seemingly innocent email or clicking on an ad-banner will sometimes put you at unwanted risk and open the door for intruders. Once they’re in, they’re sometimes hard to get rid of, so your home computer security should start with you being careful about the things you do while connected to the Internet.
