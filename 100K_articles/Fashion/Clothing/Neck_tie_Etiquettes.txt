Most of the men love to have a perfect  match of neck tie along with their dress outfit when they want to look serious, stylish or successful at formal functions. If a man wears a neck tie since a long time doesn’t means that he is doing all correct. Many men make fashion mistakes while they tie or adjust a neck tie such as a wrong kind of knot or not tying the proper length.

There are few simple ethics or rules of thumb that could help you out in getting the proper necktie etiquette: 

<b> Length of the neck tie </b>
The most often made mistake that men make is when they adjust their neck tie in a way that lets it hang too short or very long. A properly worn neck tie is one that will graze the top of a man’s pants to cover the pants buttons. While tying the neck tie up on the chest or belly is too high and covering the pants zipper is very short.

<b> Label of the neck tie </b>
Many of the men tuck the narrow part of the tie into the label sewn at the back of the wide part which is not the right way. This is because the label is not there to be used as such and ties suppose to have some natural movement. 

<b> Knot of the neck tie </b>
A wimpy or narrow knot is a big mistake because it is preferable to tie strong Double Windsor where the wide end of the neck tie is tied over the narrow end. This gives a fuller knot and a much better look. 

<b> Dimples on the neck tie </b>
Dimples never look good upon any neck tie but it doesn’t matters how many dimples are there as long as these are centered in the middle of the knot. 

These are some solutions that will let you and every man wear the neck tie in the best possible manner and look or feel great wherever he goes. For more information, visit our recommended website <a href="http://www.tying-neck-tie.info">tying-neck-tie.info </a>
