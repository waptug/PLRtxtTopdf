Article Body:
One of the planet’s most famous womens’ fashion magazines is, undoubtedly, Elle Magazine, which was created in France in the 1940’s (and is still owned by the Lagardere Group of France, but is being published by Hachette Filipacchi Media US to this day).  Not only does Elle focus on women’s fashions, it also publishes articles on the beauty, health and entertainment inspired by today’s modern woman.

Elle Magazine is most definitely the largest fashion magazine in the world with thirty-six editions on six continents throughout the world.  The magazine also has offshoot companies such as Elle DÉCOR (with nineteen editions), Elle girl (nine editions), Elle Cuisine (five editions), elle.com (sixteen websites) and high quality products such as books, footwear, eyewear and other fashion related accessories.  The U.S. edition alone reaches an audience of almost five million women who find in Elle Magazine a sharp style and substance with a more independent point of view than other magazines of its genre.

The innovators behind Elle Magazine are now located in New York where its main focus is on “fashion, beauty and style – with a brain.”  One of the best creations of the ELLE staff was the online version which has benefited with archival articles from the previous year along with sections on fashion (well, of course!); catwalk trends (“runway”); beauty; and style.  Also included and quite popular with the readers is the discussion forum and the opportunity to subscribe to an e-mail newsletter.   This site is an amazing insider’s style guide with a worldly outlook which provides both leisurely convenience and an addictive high-end inspiration to boot.   Not bad, huh?

Magazine showcases some of the most affordable designer clothing along with top quality articles that are quite informative (and actually quite interesting!).  There are also updated CD, art and book reviews in each and every issue.  Subscribers exclaim about the magazine layout and even the quality of both the cover and paper stock are raved about in the forums.  Ell Magazine is wonderful for giving its large readership information on the latest pop culture trends both in the United States and abroad while roaming away from what is presented in our present day mainstream culture.
