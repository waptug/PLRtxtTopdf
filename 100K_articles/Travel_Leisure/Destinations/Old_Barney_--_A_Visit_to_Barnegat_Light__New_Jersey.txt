Article Body:
Barnegat Light, NJ is the home to "Old Barney" a historic lighthouse located at the northern tip of Long Beach Island. Long Beach Island, or "LBI" as the vacationing folks like to say, is a narrow island nearly twenty miles long and six miles at sea off the coast of Ocean County, NJ.

The lighthouse is a destination in and of itself, if lighthouses are something that you like. Like all lighthouses, this one has distinctive markings: the top half is red and the bottom half is white. Built in 1859, the current lighthouse is the second one for that site. The original, constructed in 1824, was in disrepair and sorely in need of being replaced. Thus, the present lighthouse -- fondly called Old Barney -- was constructed.

Barnegat Light is the second tallest lighthouse in the US. It served those at sea and on land with distinguishment until its light was extinguished forever in 1965, made obsolete by electronic navigation. In the late 1980s the lighthouse was shut down for three years for much needed repairs, but then reopened to visitors. Old Barney remains a popular visitor destination and is now a state park. Nearby attractions include the beaches, fishing, historic homes, and neighboring communities on the island. LBI is easily accessible to Philadephia and New York City and is a favorite destination for those who travel to the Jersey Shore.
