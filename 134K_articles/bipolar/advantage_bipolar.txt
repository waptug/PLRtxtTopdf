Are you suffering from manic-depressive disorder? This is an illness that not all people can easily overcome. Oftentimes, people who don’t seek professional help end up committing suicide. If you don’t want this to happen to you or any of your family members, then you must learn about the illness and the possible things to undertake in order to take control of the situation and live life normally.

The illness is better known as bipolar disorder. People suffering from this disease can compare their lives to a roller coaster ride. They experience tremendous highs and extreme lows. Presently, there is no known cure for this disease, but it doesn’t mean that it can't be controlled. There are many treatments available to address intense mood swings. If you can find the right treatment, you can actually start to live your life normally even if you have bipolar.

If you constantly experience inability to do things well as if your mind has burned out and slowed down until such point that you feel virtually useless and hopeless, your humor ceases, you become irritable, uncontrollable, angry, and frightened; then you're probably suffering from bipolar disorder. Others experience a tremendous surge of ideas, their shyness disappears, they become intensely interested in sensuality/seduction, and they feel a strong sense of power, ease, omnipotence, and euphoria. Though many people disregard such occurrences and say that it will soon be over, it doesn’t hurt to seek proper medical attention. Addressing illnesses such as bipolar should start at an early stage to prevent unwanted things to happen.

If one of your family member, or yourself, is diagnosed with bipolar, there's no reason to despair. There are many resources that you can use to help you in your situation.

?	Purchase a book entitled Bipolar Advantage


This is a book written by Tom Wootton; it recognizes all aspects of bipolar disorder. Bipolar is not interpreted as an advantage, but after a two years' seminar on Bipolar, he came up with this book that positively approaches the condition. The book is all about accepting oneself and striving to be a better individual. It teaches you about Introspection, how to change certain habits to accentuate all positive aspects, and how to minimize negative ones. 

How can you do this? You can actually turn bipolar into an advantage by creating and accomplishing a vision of what you really want. After that, you need to come up with a plan that you should follow in order to achieve your goal. Wootton personally experienced both good and bad sides of bipolar because he was misdiagnosed, and for many years he learned how to cope with such situation. He conducts seminars for bipolar patients; thereby gaining personal stories from actual sufferers. He then put all these things together and came up with a book which provides a positive approach to bipolar, the right tools, and skills to improve life for the patient and his/her family.
