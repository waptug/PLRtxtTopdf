You can also freely advertise with us, exchange links with us, or be a member of our webring when you register. When you get to be a part of our webring, you get free exposure/traffic as visitors click on the other member sites of the webring. You can advertise your properties for sale or lease with us. And since we are constantly on-line and browsing the web, you can also exchange links with us for more free traffic or you can submit real estate articles to be posted on the site after being approved by the site owners.

PLC Global will shortly be introducing the Realtor Webring where all Realtors, Brokers and Agents will have their own Web Page, Profile and summary of the properties they are selling.
