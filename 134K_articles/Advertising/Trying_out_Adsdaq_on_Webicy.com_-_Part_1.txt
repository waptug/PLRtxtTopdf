Our site was approved in no time and i was able to set up the adzone. I have placed the ads in the forum and they are doing well.

Adsdaq is placed at Tier 1 and I have adtoll in Tier 2 so Adtoll covers up in case there are no ads to display.

The ads are placed below the navbar in the forum and i have used the 728×90 Leaderboard format.

The fill rate daily is anything between 25-30%.

In the next part I’ll be sharing the types of ads being displayed, number of impressions, fill rate, etc.
