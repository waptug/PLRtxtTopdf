How are these file compare software so efficient? There are many advantages when you compare two files. You can avoid mistakes or come up with perfect and desired results when you compare two files. Apart from comparing two files, file comparing software also allow you to compare logical and physical drives, compound or alternate streams of files.

Steps involved in comparing software. There is a common procedure in most comparison software when you are looking forward to compare two files.

The foremost step that is involved when we compare two files is opening the object file that is referred as the primary one.

The second step that is unique in different software is opening the windows used for comparison using Compare / Search command. After the search is over and a list of file is displayed, you can select an object file from the list for comparing with primary files. We call these object files as secondary. Secondary files can be both physical and logical.

Block comparison while we compare two files. You can easily compare a small part of source file by specifying the exact starting addresses and the requisite block size. In case of active selection, some software pre-fills the required fields.

It is an obvious mode when we compare two files. The striking feature is its interpretation of the empty areas. Empty offset address means lowest address that are usually considered zero. Empty size address means the remaining file.

Result of Comparison. Most software has the results displayed in different colored blocks containing matching, differing and unique data separately. Generally, unique and differing ones are similar containing data absent in the primary file. However, unique blocks contain data that are not available in either of the files.

Window used for editing after we compare two files. The window used for editing is displayed after we compare two files. The primary is displayed in top or the left pane while the secondary is displayed in lower or the right one depending upon the type of arrangement used.

Primary and secondary files are treated in a slight different manner. Secondary is always in a read-only format. The reason for this limitation is that the secondary is not required for editing it is only used for comparison. It might be under application at the time of comparison or it can also be a system file. Attempting to open them for accessing might cause unwanted errors. However, this is considered the only restriction as you are allowed browsing them, defining data fields and bookmarks, copying, dragging, exporting data, and many more.

Comparison Map. There are cases where the software contains comparison maps present left to the editing field showing the layout of the file and correspondence between different blocks in unique graphical forms. They are extremely beneficial especially when blocks of the files being compared are neither too large nor too small. It is an optional scheme for your benefit. You can use it or avoid it according to your needs.

Comparison Pane. Comparison pane is also another option providing complete information relating to the layout of a file. There are two comparison panes present when we compare two files as each of them has a distinct layout.
