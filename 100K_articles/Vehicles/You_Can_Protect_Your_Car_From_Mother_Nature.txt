Article Body:
Mother Nature has it out for you…your car, that is. The moment you bring your vehicle home from the dealership, the assault has begun. Sun, rain, snow, hail, dust, birds, debris, pollution, and a host of other elements and items can doom your “new car” look in no time. What can you do? Fight back, that’s how. Let’s take a look at some smart ways you can protect your vehicle’s finish and keep it from looking old before its time.

<b>Wash and wax.</b> Okay, so you don’t have a hose handy. If you go to the car wash, make sure that it is brushless, otherwise the circular marks on your finish will certainly do a number on your car’s appearance in no time. As far as waxing your vehicle, polishes made by popular brands including <i>Turtle Wax </i> should do the trick. Yes, I know, a friend recommended a particular brand that can give your car a look that is better than new. Go ahead and use it…just follow the directions on the bottle <i>precisely</i>!

<b>Keep it covered.</b> Yes, driving down the street with a car cover on your car will certainly get you some attention! I do <i>not</i> recommend that you do that, but having a car cover available for your vehicle makes sense even if you keep your prized possession garaged. Dust and indoor pollution can take its toll even when your car sits in your garage while bird crap, moisture, hail, tree sap, the sun, and small impacts can hurt your car’s finish when parked outside. The more layers your car cover has, the better the protection it will offer too. Select one that has mirror pockets for the best fit.

<b>Minor details.</b> Other accessories that offer protection for your vehicle include: floor mats and liners, seat covers, vent shades, hood protectors, and brake dust shields. If you carry pets regularly then a pet pad or pet box can protect your interior like nothing else.

When purchasing cleaning products make sure you read all labels carefully. That cleaner you use may not be the best thing for your wheels and the interior of your car should have its own type of cleaner. Check manufacturer’s recommendations to make sure that the product you use is the right one; some cars come with an initial supply of cleaning materials to help you properly treat your brushed aluminum or burl wood interior.
