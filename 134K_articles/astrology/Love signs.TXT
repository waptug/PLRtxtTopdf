Love signs

The stars can provide much insight about ourselves, including how, when, and with whom we are most likely to fall in love. Of course, astrology is not destiny, so while the one you love may not be a classic match for you in astrological terms, that doesn't mean all is lost. By understanding the universal forces that attract you to your lover, you can learn how to make any relationship work, and better understand your own self in the process.

First consider how accurate your own horoscope is. There are similarities among many of them, but find the resource that best describes YOU. Then use that same resource to do a little research on your beloved. You certainly don’t have to reject someone because he’s <gasp> a Water sign and you’re a Fire sign. But, it can certainly provide some insight into why you two clash, or why you think he’s a wet blanket sometimes. 

You can really go into detail about the ideal zodiac mate for you, but it’s hard enough to find someone, isn’t it. So don’t walk away from that Water or Earth guy. Use your knowledge to understand him. Maybe you need to borrow some tips from Air or Earth to help manage the communications between the two of you or to help resolve conflicts.

There are many really good books and Web sites to help you figure out the details of your zodiac match. Do a little research. And make it fun! What’s your sign can be a cliché, but if you deliver the line in the right way, it can also be a good ice breaker. If you’re a Virgo, and you’re introduced to, say, a Libra, tell him he’s got his work cut out for him. Everyone loves a challenge and it’s an easy way to flirt and start to get to know someone.
