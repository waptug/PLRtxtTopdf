Advantages and Purposes of a Police Scanner
Surprisingly a police scanner can help people in many ways, whether it is through excitement or through a sense of safety.
&#61548;	Firstly, police scanners are quite exciting to tune into. It is a human instinct to want to know what is happening when, for example a police car, an ambulance, or a fire truck is blazing by. With a police scanner, a user would know exactly what is going on.
&#61548;	Also, it can help a user lessen the impact any potential environmental disasters may cause. For example, earthquakes, thunderstorms, and tornadoes could be immediately responded to by taking the necessary actions with the guidance of a police scanner.
&#61548;	Potential accidents such as toxic spills or power outages near the user can also be responded to if the user was tuning into a police scanner.
&#61548;	Neighborhood crimes are also unpredictable. However, with a police scanner, anyone can be constantly updated with the latest news and any precautions that they should take. A collective effort by many people with police scanners in the same neighborhood can lead to a much safer community.
