Article Body:
Sometimes automakers really do listen to consumers. In the case of Ford, particularly with its crowd pleasing F-150 pick-up truck, Ford not only is listening, but delivering. What am I talking about? A hot-rod pick-up truck, that’s what. That’s right, Ford is going ahead with plans to market a truly “boss” version of its perennially best selling truck, the F-150, to give many fans just what they have wanted. Read on for a sneak preview of Ford’s soon to be released FX2, a dream-come-true for avid Ford lovers.

With gas prices approaching record levels, some are questioning Ford’s decision to release yet another version of its highly popular full sized pick-up truck, the F-150. Yet, demand for big trucks and SUVs continues to remain strong suggesting that size really does matter for many consumers. True, a smaller truck can be adequate for some motorists however most contractors require the large carrying capacity of the F-150 thus the continued high demand of these types of trucks. Plus, serious pick-up truck drivers will tell you that there is nothing that matches the abundant capacity of an eight foot bed in carrying everything from lumber to yard debris to sport gear and more. 

As it is with many truck owners, function is one thing while styling is but another. Base versions of the F-150 are attractive and capable enough, but sport concepts have continued to create so much buzz that Ford is responding to consumer demand by building the FX2. Specifically, the new model is in response to the overwhelmingly positive buzz a concept version has been receiving at auto shows everywhere.

So, what separates the FX2 from the average F-150? Plenty, including the following features as shared by Ford in a recent press release announcing the new model:

--	a dark billet grille

--	a sporty, deep front valance

--	clear headlights paired with platinum bezels

--	monochromatic paint scheme that blends in the bumper, side mirrors, and door handles with the rest of the truck

--	chrome exhaust tip

--	18 inch wheels

--	black captain chairs with red stitching, available in clothe or in leather

--	flow-through center console with floor shifter

Engine choices haven’t been announced, but Ford has said that its popular 5.4L V8 will be offered. The FX2, a two wheel drive vehicle, will complement an existing off road model, the FX4. Ford builds more versions of its full sized pick up truck than any other manufacturer in the world.

Yes, the FX2 is another part of Ford’s “Bold Moves” promotional campaign. While the new model is based on an existing truck, it does something that Ford is finally learning to do right: listen to its consumers. With the 2007 F-150 FX2, it appears that Ford has responded with certainty.
