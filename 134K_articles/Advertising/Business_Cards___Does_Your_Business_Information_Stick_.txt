Article Body:
Everybody that has ever been to a meeting, can recall the all familiar "passing" of the business cards. 

This powerfull marketing tool is often used matter of factly, and we have to wonder how often does the recipient of your card hold on to it, and use your business information positively?

In a world where first impressions count and business is becoming more competitive, it would be foolish to go with the crowd. 

You have to act different to make a impact so that you will be remembered when the rest are forgotten. Often times, traditional business cards reflects your name, position in the company and contact details...not very inspiring. 

Full colour business cards might be a better option, but once again,you would have needed to make some kind of impression, for the recipient of your card to give it a second glance.

In my opinion then, it's not your actual business information that counts, but how you present it. 

I recently, in a situation typical to the one described above, held my photo business card that is printed on vinyl, back until the meeting drew to an end. I kindly requested my prospects to pass their diaries on to me...they did so, but looked a bit dazed. I sticked my information in their diaries and passed it back with a remark that I accept that sometimes things get lost, but NOT my business cards. 

Surprised smiles all around, I knew I made a definite impression and they might just follow up on my information. 

Next time you need business cards printed, think carefully, not only on content, but how you plan to present this vital information.
