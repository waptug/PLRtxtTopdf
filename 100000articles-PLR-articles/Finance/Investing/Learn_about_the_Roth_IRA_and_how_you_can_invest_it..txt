Article Body:
<p>A Roth IRA is another type of Individual Retirement Account (IRA). With a Roth IRA contributions to the account are not tax deductible, but “qualified” withdrawals from the account are not taxable either. A “qualified” distribution from a Roth IRA is a withdrawal made after the taxpayer attains age 59 ½. Also a Roth IRA is qualified if it is made to a beneficiary after the taxpayer’s death, made because the tax payer is disabled, or made by a first-time homebuyer to acquire their original residence.

<p>Distributions from a Roth IRA can be made after the owner reaches 70 ½.  
Currently with a Roth IRA there is an income ceiling where you can’t invest in a Roth IRA if your single and your adjusted gross income is higher than $95,000, or $150,000. The amount you can contribute to a Roth IRA reaches zero for incomes of $110,000 for single people and $160,000 for those who are married. There are proposals to remove the ceiling. 
A new popular trend with a Roth IRA is to take the funds out and invest them into real estate, businesses, tax liens, and more. An IRA called a self directed IRA is created, and an LLC (Limited Liability Company) or a C-Corporation is formed. Once it is setup the funds are available in a checking account and are ready to invest. 

<p>Turning an IRA into a self directed IRA is a difficult process and websites like <A HREF="http://www.ira123.com">www.ira123.com</A> make this process much simpler by providing solutions so people can quickly get a self directed IRA setup.
