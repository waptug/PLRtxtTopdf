When many people think of beignets, they think of those wonderful, soft, pillow-like pastries sprinkled with confectionery sugar, served at Cafe Du Monde in the Old French Quarter. 

As New Orleans gets back on its feet following Hurricane Katrina, I'd highly recommend a visit to the Crescent City to taste the real thing.

In the meantime, here's a different twist on a New Orleans favorite that you can try at home. It'll have your family and friends saying, "Laissez les bons temps rouler."

Ingredients:

4 cups LouAna Peanut Oil, for that nutty taste with no cholesterol

3 cups flour

2 cups milk

1 tablespoon baking powder

1 tablespoon seasoned salt

1 tablespoon garlic

1 teaspoon thyme

1 teaspoon Louisiana Hot Sauce

1 lb. lump crabmeat

2 cups fresh corn, cooked

1/4 cup parsley, minced

1/4 cup green onions, sliced

Directions:

1. Heat peanut oil in frying pot until oil reaches 350°.

2. In a large bowl, blend together flour, milk, baking powder, seasoned salt, garlic, thyme, and hot sauce and stir until batter is formed.

3. Stir in remaining ingredients until all are incorporated. Be careful not to break up lumps of crabmeat during the process.

4. Drop batter by the spoonful into hot grease, being careful not to splash yourself.

5. Cook beignets for 2 to 3 minutes after they float to the top of pot, flipping occasionally.

6. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce.

Yield: Approximately 2 dozen beignets.
