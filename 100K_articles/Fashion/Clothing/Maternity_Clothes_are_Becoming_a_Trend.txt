It used to be that women had to wear the big and bulky pants with huge tops that had no color or style to them.  For most of the clothes, they had no flair to them and did not flatter the women who wore them.  Most of the time, the women who wore them looked like a big tent as their belly grew.  These clothes may have been comfortable, but they did make the women feel good about how they looked.  

Today, there is hope for pregnant women and the maternity clothes that they wear.  So many designers are coming up with new and improved ideas for their maternity clothing line.
