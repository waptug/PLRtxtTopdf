Article Body:
Shifting your geographical location often evokes mixed feelings of nostalgia and excitement. We peep into the past to relive and relish the bygone days while we keep cherishing the dreams that we foresee for our future. It’s perhaps one of the life’s most contrasting episodes woven with pains and pleasures. 

 Retirement, job change, transfer, family needs or possibly anything can be the reason of emigration. Emigration from U.K, besides many others, can be problematic for people who wanted to sell off their property before leaving the country. 

Finding right buyer for your property these days in U.K is a daunting task because of the sluggish economy and low mortgage approval rates. And in addition if you have time constraints then finding a potential buyer in open market can be pie in the sky. 

Often people not very conversant with the process of a property sale in the open market go to real estate agents. Real estate agents can help you but only when they are able to find the right buyers for you. You have to be prepared for a whole lot of uncertainty and knowing that it could take a long time to close the deal. Plus, it may happen that when you are on the verge of closing the deal, you came to know the buyer backtracked. That means you have to restart the whole process. 

When you have paucity of time and you are not so sure of closing the deal, just strike the right chord by approaching private investors or cash buyers of property. The cash buyers buy your property within the timeframe you provide to them. They take care of the entire mortgage balance, if any, on your property. At a measly discounted market rate they buy your house and pay you cash for the equity you have in your house. 

The advantages of dealing with cash home buyers can be summed up as: 

•	Be debt free: You can pay off all your debts and move away 

•	Move house easily: They offer a guaranteed completion date - so you can move when you want.

•	Get cash fast: You can get hold of the money tied up in your home – quickly

•	No hassles: You do not have to get into costly and complicated process of selling property. They take care of entire proceedings.  

Dealing with cash buyers of property, if you are looking for a fast deal, can actually help you saving your time and efforts.  Not to speak of the hassles and pains that one normally has to undergo while selling a property in U.K, especially when you have time constraints.
