You get into the online music world. You've had this song playing in the back of your mind all day and now you've decided that you want to download it. You search for it specifically and find that there's a site that is offering you exactly the song you want for free. 

All you had to do is give them your email. You download it. The next thing you know you have a pop up coming out every time you open your browser window. 

You failed to notice all the signs that told you this was going to happen. The banners, the smiley ads, the popups, you just thought you could download it in a clean file. 

This happens every day. This is what happens to many people that are looking to download music online. They fall prey to the illegal sources taking advantage of millions of people downloading music out there. 

Fortunately people are smartening up and starting to notice that illegal downloads from dubious sites are something to stay away from from the beggining. They are starting to notice and become aware that these downloads sometimes can cost you many times the price of a of a single music file download and can be hazardous to your computer. 

There are new alternatives to download music that are proven to be cost effective and can become a "one for all" kind of resource that you can turn to. Places where you can just search for that tune you want (the one that's been on your head all day), point on it and download it without having to worry about getting a trojan virus just for doing so. 

I highly recommend for the sake of your computer, your peace of mind and to avoid downloading bogus files, for you to be sure you download all your songs from a legal source that you can trust. There's nothing better than having the confidence that when you open up an Mp3 file you just downloaded and knowing it's going to play exactly what you had in mind. 

When you do it like this, when you do it the smart way, it all becomes much simpler, more effective and a ride that you'll want to repeat over and over again. That's all there is to downloading music when you're doing it right. Next thing you know you're cranking your mp3's on your computer you're playing them as loud as you can.
