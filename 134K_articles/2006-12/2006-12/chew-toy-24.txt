Chew Toy

My mom has the cutest little dog. I don’t have one, but if I did, I would have one just like hers. Her name is Curly Sue and she’s a bundle of attitude most of the time, but it’s not really bad attitude. She’s just spunky and everyone falls in love with her instantly. She has a lot of toys, but her favorite is one particular chew toy that is shaped like a hotdog. I’m not sure what makes it different than any of the other toys that she has, but it is the one she seems to love more than all the rest.

We often find her chew toys lodged somewhere as if she were trying to hide it. She’s not good at hiding it though. She always puts it somewhere that is easy for us to find, and is usually in a chair or somewhere like that. We might sit on it, and she comes running to get it away from us. It’s as if she thinks we keep taking the chew toy out of her clever hiding place, but in reality she’s not hiding it anywhere special. On the other hand, perhaps she’s cleverer than we give her credit for. She may leave it where she does just so she can come get it from us.

I’m afraid her favorite chew toy is on its last leg, and I’m not even sure if we can find a replacement. Though the chew toy has only been her favorite for a little less than a year, it was purchased a long time ago. The chew toy sat in the closet for a long time before my mom gave it to her. I don’t know where she bought it all those years ago, and I doubt we can find the same one today. When the toy falls apart, I don’t know what she is going to do.

Most dogs seem to have a favorite chew toy that they just can’t seem to part with. If your dog takes a shine to a certain one, you may want to go out and get a few replacements while you can. That way if a chew toy falls apart from too much love you have a spare to replace it. Though it may seem like just a toy to you, if a dog loves a certain chew toy it becomes like a friend to them, and they may be devastated when it’s gone.
