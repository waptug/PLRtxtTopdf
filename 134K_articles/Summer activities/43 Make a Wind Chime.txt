Make a Wind Chime

The sound of a wind time in the summer breeze is very relaxing and making one can 
occupy the children for an afternoon.  The materials you will need are items that will 
make a pretty sound when they rub against each other (shells, beads, or even old 
utensils), something sharp to poke a hole through each item, a hammer, string, a round 
item (a lid or piece of wood) for the top, and a hook to hang the wind chime.

Once all the items are collected the adult should use the hammer and sharp object (such 
as a screwdriver) to make a hole in each object.  If the item is too hard to make a hole in 
(like a rock) tie string around it several times until it is secured.  After the holes are made 
tie a piece of string to each item.

Take your tools again and punch holes in the round lid that you are going to use, one for 
each item that will be hanging from the wind chime.  Thread the string through the hole 
and tie a knot so that it will not fall back through.  Poke two more holes in the lid and tie 
one piece of string through both holes and attach the hook. 

All that is left is to find the perfect spot for your wind chime.  Place it close enough so 
that it can be heard through an open window on a breezy day.  If the items do not knock 
against each other when the wind blows you may have to adjust the lengths of the string a 
few times until you get it just right.  Keep an eye on the wind chime to make sure it 
doesn’t loose any of the pieces.  If it does be sure to pick them up as they can pose a 
choking hazard to young children.
