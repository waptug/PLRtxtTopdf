If your looking for an exotic place to take your next winter or summer vacation Albania might just be the place to kick back and relax. Albania is a Mediterranean country in south east Europe. 

Bordered by Montenegro to the north, the Republic of Macedonia to the east, and Greece in the south, Albania has something to see and do for every traveller. In the west Albania is coast to the Adriatic Sea. Not just one sea, <a href="http://www.pixibot.com/3-albania" target="_blank">Albania</a> also coasts the Ionian Sea to the south west. With the large water basins located so close all the time Albania just so happens to be a water lovers paradise. Time to pull out those waterwings, and get out there!

Albania consists mostly of hilly and mountainous terrain. Korab, The highest mountain, is in the district of Dibra. Korab reachs heights of up to 2,753 m. For a second there my guess is that you thought that this country would only offer something to the 'mediterranean water lover'. What about the mountains. Perfect for an array of sports like mountain climbing, hiking, scrambling, mountain biking, nature watching and more. 

Albania's climate with it's sea's offers very hot summers. The capital city is Tirana, which as a population of about 520,000 . Because of Albania's poor economy, it is easy to find cheap places to stay and to eat while visiting there!
