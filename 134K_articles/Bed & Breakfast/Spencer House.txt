Spencer House

Spencer House Bed &Breakfast is located in historical downtown Erie Pennsylvania.  Step back in time for a restful stay in our restored Victorian home. When it was built in 1876, the Victorian home at 519 West Sixth Street was one of the showiest homes in the city. The original woodwork is one of the most eye-catching features of the interior, along with the 12-foot ceilings and interior folding shutters.

Guests are invited to relax in the elegant parlor, with its beautiful fireplace and baby grand piano, or select a good book from the well-stocked library. The Treetop Suite skims the treetops and looks on both the front and rear of the house. A queen-sized bed with floor-to-ceiling canopy gives a very romantic atmosphere to the room. The original marble sink, a lovely window seat, book nook, and sitting area provide you with space to meet all you needs. The bathroom has an original over-sized tiled shower.

The Captain's Quarters takes on the theme of Erie's shipping industry with a room fit for the Commander himself. A king sized bed in a room filled with old world charm gives way to a Cape Cod style bathroom complete with a two person Jacuzzi tub and separate shower.

The Kenya Room houses a collection of artwork from Africa. This beautiful room decorated in soft greens, has a gas fireplace and the original armoire. There are two full-sized beds and a sitting area to take pleasure in quiet conversation. The bathroom next door has a large claw foot tub with a shower for relaxing night soaks at the end of the day.
	
These are but three of the seven choices visitor's have within this elegant building.  Plan on staying some time to see all the surrounding area has to offer.
