If you have never used online classifieds before, or if you have only played around, you're probably speculative what all the publicity is about. You estimate that except for those families who reside hundreds of miles from the nearby store, purchasing online is a comfort, not a necessary. So how handy could it be? What could be simple than traversing in your automotive vehicle and travel to the shopping mall ... and seeking for a parking position, and walk from store to outlet and aisle to aisle looking for the products you want, and waiting in the check-out line, and move those bags out to the car through a drenching rain force, and driving home through the traffic.

We are no longer restricted to local readers or a local market, we now have access to demonstrate our products, services, need and wants to over 1.2 billion people whom use the internet periodicly.

In many instances, shopping over the net is a immediate and painless alternative. Sometimes it enables you to do things that otherwise would be inconceivable for you, or can save you trouble and money -- lots of it. When that isn't the case, just shop the way you always have.

You should shop on the Internet when:

~ You know exactly what you want, and you want to get it over with, with a small indefinite amount of fuss and time. You don't want to spend an hour or more driving to a physical shop and going through the usual routine there; and, if the product is not in stock at the store you go to, you don't want to have to travel to another and another, or wait weeks for delivery.

~ You know what kind of object you want to acquire, but not precisely which one, which volume or recording or Movie. Likewise, you don't want to discard your cash acquiring something you won't want and throw away your time figuring out that you made a mistake.

~ You know what you want to purchase, but it's rare, few retail stores would seldom keep in stock such a item.

~ You want to buy something that is costly (such as a automobile or a business organization). You have to compare many different prices because you aren't fabulously loaded.


What do you need to look for?

Look for a website that offers a international market but with local possibilities. Most importantly make sure all the content is free!

Thats about it - Thank you and Enjoy
