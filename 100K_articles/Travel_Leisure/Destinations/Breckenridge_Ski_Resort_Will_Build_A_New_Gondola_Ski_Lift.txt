Article Body:
After twenty years of wishful thinking, Breckenridge will finally move forward and build the Gondola in Spring of 2006. This project should be completed by Christmas of 2006. The Breckenridge Gondola will fit up to 8 people and will load right in the free skier parking lots. The path of the Gondola will travel through the Shock Hill neighborhood and on to both Peak 7 and Peak 8 base areas.

The Gondola Project is part of a much larger plan that started last year when they built the Imperial Express ski lift and extended a skiing trail directly to the free skier parking lots. Next on the list will be an expansion of the Peak 7 base area to include a restaurant and other facilities.

The town of Breckenridge also plans on diverting traffic off of Main St. with a hope to preserve the old town main street look and feel. There is a lot going on in Breckenridge right now and next year at this time, you will see a complete transformation.

The new Breckenridge Gondola will have a capacity of 3,000 riders per hour, 143 cabins, 7,843 ft. in length, 25 towers, 2 mid stations at Shock Hill and Peak 7 base area, 7.5 minute ride from the transit center to Peak 8 terminal.

We can't wait to see you out here!
Enjoy your ski vacation in Breckenridge, CO.
