If you want to compete in the game of games and play against the best day traders in the world, then you need to get ready. Too many gamblers are entering the arena without any plan or strategy, completely unprepared, and that's why they lose. Trading a system will dramatically increase your chances to succeed in trading, because it eliminates five of the top six reasons why unprepared traders fail.
Here are the top six reasons why traders fail,
and how a trading system eliminates them
Let's take a look at the reasons why traders lose money: 
1. Lack of a good <a href="http://www.rockwelltrading.com/daytradingcoach/01_dtc_moreinfo.html#COACHING"><b>Day Trading Plan</b></a>
2. Lack of Discipline to Follow the Trading Plan
3. Failure to Control Emotions
4. Failure to Accept and Limit Losses
5. Lack of Commitment
6. Over-Trading
By all means you have to avoid these mistakes if you want to win. Here's how a trading system eliminates 5 of the 6 top reasons why traders fail:

Solution #1: Having a trading plan 
Having a trading system means having a pre-defined set of rules you have developed to guide your day trading. Therefore you HAVE a trading plan, eliminating the No.1 cause for failure.
Solution #2: Following the day trading plan 
The easiest way to follow a day trading plan is to automate it. Almost every <a href="http://www.rockwelltrading.com/daytradingcoach/01_dtc_moreinfo.html#STRATEGIES"><b>daytrading system</b></a> can be automated, and you could let the computer trade online for you. You won't have to worry about your discipline any longer, as the computer mechanically trades every setup for you.
Solution #3: Controlling emotions 
Trading with a system removes emotions from trading. If you don't have a day trading strategy and you try to make decisions when the market is moving, you are liable to become emotionally attached to positions. You may experience panic and indecision when the market does not move in your favor, as you do not have a prepared response. That's when most traders lose their money. If you follow a system you will know what to do no matter what the market does.
Solution #4: Controlling your losses 
You probably have heard the saying Let your profits run. Unfortunately most traders let their losses run. A daytrading system will get you out of a position when the predefined stop is hit. Unless you override the system to give the trade a little bit more room it will stop the loss and therefore limit your losses.
Solution #5: Commitment 
You won't believe how many traders show a lack of commitment and therefore lose money. Lack of commitment means that they stop trading after the first loss, and don't give their system a chance to make back the money they lost. Trading is not a one-way street, and losses are part of our business. If you can't accept the fact that there will be losses, you shouldn't trade. Fortunately a trading system can help you to overcome this problem; an automated daytrading system continues trading according to the rules, and therefore adds much more consistency to your trading.
As you can see, Five of the six top reasons why traders lose money in the markets are simply eliminated when you start trading with a system. Without any guarantee, your chances of making money rise incredibly when starting with a profitable trading system.
