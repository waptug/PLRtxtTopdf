With the high cost of fuel and gasoline at present, it would not be very surprising to find out if people started opting to take road trips less this summer. In fact, this kind of assumption has been backed up by a recent survey which was conducted by the National Retail Federation. 

According to such a study, around 37 per cent of consumers have already decided to cut back and lessen their travel plans. All these are due to the high cost of fuel that they would be spending on once they take road trips. As per other people still wanting to take that road trip, their answer to the situation would be to actually move past some of their targeted areas and locations and just go straight right to the important ones.
