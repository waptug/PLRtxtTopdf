FOREX trading is nothing more than direct access trading of different types of foreign currencies.  In the past, foreign exchange trading was mostly limited to large banks and institutional traders.  Recent technological advancements have made it so that small traders can also take advantage of the many benefits of FOREX trading by using the various online trading platforms.

FOREX markets possess unique attributes that offer unmatched potential for profitable trading in any market  or any stage of the business cycle.  For starters, FOREX trading boasts a 24-hour market, giving traders the chance to take advantage of profitable market conditions anytime.  Secondly, the FOREX market is the most liquid market in the world.  FOREX traders can enter or exit the market whenever they want, during almost any market condition. There also exist minimal execution barriers or risk and no daily trading limits. 


For all the advantages of the FOREX market, one glaring weakness emerges.  The FOREX market is seen as unregulated although the operations of major dealers, like commercial banks in money centers, are regulated under the banking laws. The daily operations of retail FOREX brokerages are not regulated under any laws or regulations  specific to the FOREX market.  Many of these types of establishments in the United States, don't even report to the I.R.S.  To make the most of the explosive potential of successful FOREX trading, individuals should follow these guidelines.

1.Determine the quality of the broker institution you choose.
Unlike equity brokers, FOREX brokers are usually attached to large banks or lending institutions because of the large amounts of capital that is required.  FOREX brokers should be registered with the Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) as well as regulated by the Commodity Future Trading Commission (CFTC)

2. Request a free trial. 
Before you commit to any broker, be sure to request free trials so that you can test their different trading platforms.  Brokers usually provide technical as well as fundamental commentaries, economic calendars and other research as a means of assisting you.  Basically, a quality broker will provide everything one needs to succeed.


3.Monitor two financial meetings to provide insight into the upcoming FOREX market.
Two important meetings FOREX traders should watch for are the federal Open Market Committee and the Humphrey Hawkins Hearings.  By reading the reports and examining the commentary, FOREX fundamental analysts can get a better understanding of any and all long-term market trends it also allows short-term traders to be able to profit from extraordinary happenings.
