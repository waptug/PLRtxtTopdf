Summary:
If I were you I'd be skeptical also.

The Internet is so full of scams, it's hard to surf for ten minutes without stepping into one! These scams give legitimate programs and opportunities a bad name.

I've been ripped off many times, but it rarely happens anymore. I can easily tell when an online job or program is for real, and when it's not. Here's what you need to do:

The Internet is so full of scams, it's hard to surf for ten minutes without stepping into one! These scams give legitimate programs and opportunities a bad name.

I've been ripped off many times, but it rarely happens anymore. I can easily tell when an online job or program is for real, and when it's not. Here's what you need to do:

1. Look for real proofs of earnings and testimonials.

If an online job tells you that you can earn $1,000 a day working for them online, look for proof! Do they have proof of earnings clearly on display? If they don't, they're probably not for real!

Are there testimonials from real people on the site? Are people making money? This is very important to look for.

2. Is there a guarantee?

When evaluating a job or online opportunity, you must look for a solid guarantee.

When there is a guarantee, you know that the owner stands behind his or her job or program. They are willing to let you test it out risk free! Now that's confidence.

When there's a guarantee you really have nothing to lose.

3. Trust the experts!

People like myself have spent years getting burned on online opportunities and have amassed a lot of knowledge on how to spot a real, profitable job or online opportunity. Visit review sites such as www.nateharding.com/data/ that have already evaluated and tested the opportunities you are currently looking at.

Let the mistakes of others save you money.

4. Start slow and don’t panic.

Starting a new online job can be a bit scary. Even when you join you may feel lost or unsure if this is for you. You must give it a chance!

There is a learning curve with anything in life, and it may take some time for you to learn exactly what to do. You will receive training and support, so use it! If you need help, ask for it. Remember, you can make money online. Tons of people are doing it, and they were all beginners at one time.

5. Work it for real.

When you decide to take an online job or join an online opportunity, treat it as a real, offline business. Since it’s online and usually done from home, many people don’t treat it like a real offline job.

To succeed, you must treat your new online job like a real online job. Don’t slack off. Set a schedule. Remember, you only get back what you put it.

Put as much into your new online job as possible, and it will reward you.
