Why Are Brake Bleeders Required?
Brake fluid absorbs water from the atmosphere, lowering its boiling point and causing corrosion. Particulate contamination--microscopic particles of rust and rubber-hastens wear of moving components. This is why manufacturers and mechanics recommend fully flushing hydraulic fluid annually. In addition, whenever the hydraulic system has been opened it must be bled of air. You should also routinely flush and replace your brake fluid every two years. Deposits and debris can build up in the lines over time and decrease the efficiency of your brakes. Regular brake bleeding can also help you spot brake problems that you wouldn’t necessarily notice simply by driving the car. 
Brake Bleeding Tools and Their Functionality
Brake bleeding is the procedure performed on hydraulic brake systems whereby the brake lines (the pipes and hoses containing the brake fluid) are purged of any air bubbles. This is necessary because, while the brake fluid is an incompressible liquid, air bubbles are compressible gas and their presence in the brake system greatly reduces the hydraulic pressure that can be developed within the system. The same methods used for brake bleeding are also used for purging, where the old fluid is replaced with new fluid, which is necessary maintenance. The process is performed by forcing clean, bubble-free brake fluid through the entire system from the master cylinder(s) to the calipers of disc brakes or the wheel cylinders of drum brakes). The brake bleeder valve is normally mounted at the highest point on each cylinder or caliper. 
Procedures Of Brake Bleeding 
The first step in bleeding your brakes is to fill the system with brake fluid. A useful product is the pressure brake bleeder like the Motive Products Bleeder .This product is a step above its now-defunct precursor, the EZ-Bleed system. The system has a hand pump that you can use to pressurize the brake fluid to just about any pressure. A small gauge on the front of the brake fluid reservoir indicates the pressure of the brake fluid inside. The very large reservoir can hold about two quarts of brake fluid – more than enough for most brake flushing and bleeding jobs. The system bleeds by pressurizing a bottle filled with brake fluid from air from an internal hand pump.  The procedure is to add fluid, attach the bleeder to the top of the reservoir cap, and pump up the bleeder bottle using the hand pump, this will pressurize the system.
The Fast, Simple And User-Friendly Brake Bleeder
This amazing brake bleeder kit is a very useful and cost-effective tool to have in your collection. A specialized pressure pump, such as the Motive Product Power Bleeder is attached to the master cylinder and filled with fluid. The pump is used to pressurize the system to about 10psi, and the bleeder valves are opened one at a time until the fluid is clear of air. One advantage to this system is that the pump reservoir usually holds enough fluid that running dry is not likely. This is the method most professional shops use, though they use commercial equipment instead of the above mentioned unit.
