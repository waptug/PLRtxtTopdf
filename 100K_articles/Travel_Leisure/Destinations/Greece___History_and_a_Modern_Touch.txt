Greece

Walk practically anywhere in Greece and you are walking in the footsteps of antiquity. The home to such historical figures, fictional or not, as Plato and Homer. [not Homer Simpson – the other one]. As the center of modern civilization, Greece is considered the home of art, philosophy and many other aspects of culture which set us apart from other creatures. While you could literally spend months in Greece visiting and exploring archeological sites, there country is known for very modern pleasures. 

The beaches of Greece are world famous as is the nightlife. For nightlife, Athens is a vibrant city that more or less stays open all night long. Even on Mondays! For sheer excitement, take a taxi on a trip through the city which will make any roller coaster look tame. You can walk through the various market areas or visit the new structures and parks created for the recent Olympic Summer Games. 

If a tan is a must, you’re best off heading to the islands. Islands such as Santorini, Ios and Mykinos are the stuff of legend among sunbathers. You can burn under the Mediterranean sun all day and party like a rock star all night. All the islands can be reached by ferry with trips taking a few hours. 

The Greeks are colorful and a fun-loving group of people. Sit down in a little café somewhere and you’ll soon be talking to a local with tears of laughter in your eyes. Just make sure you watch out for friendly ouzo toasts. They pack a punch. A serious punch. 

If you’re looking for a travel destination with both historical locations and a chance to loaf on the beach, nothing beats Greece. Prices are generally cheap, so give it a try.
