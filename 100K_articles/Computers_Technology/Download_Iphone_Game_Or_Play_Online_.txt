As an Iphone owner, you may or may not know that as well as being able to use the safari browser to play online, or browser based games as they are known you can also download games for the Iphone. Check out these tips for downloading games onto your Iphone.

First of all, your little Iphone is packed with more computing power than you may possibly realise. While browser games may be cool, they can often be a little basic, so you will need to download things to get the real cream of the crop.

The second point is to make sure and have a good look around some of the download sites. There are quite a few of them around now, and you can find the variety between them quite staggering. Also, one of the coolest things is that if you find the right sites, the game downloads will be totally free, which is obviously great.

Something else to consider is that some download sites can be pretty dangerous to your computer, because of viruses etc. If you are familiar with file sharing sites or P2P sites or whatever you want to call them, you may well have experience of viruses etc. This is because sites like this most often don't have any guidelines or regulation by the site owners or webmaster, allowing users to upload whatever they like. It seems cool to have this freedom at first, but it means that many of the sites are riddled with viruses and spyware etc.

As a final tip, always look for reports or reviews from a previous customer – it's very easy to make a site look all exciting and trustworthy on the internet, so looking out for someone else's experience with that particular site can be very helpful indeed – it can save you money in the long run and can even help your computer stay protected from virus and other nasty things!

You'll find that with virtually all of the worthwhile Iphone download sites, you will need to pay some kind of fee before you get access to the downloads. This fee is usually what helps them provide the free downloads in the first place, as it helps them cover costs and administration etc. It's not such a bad thing either, because the small fee in question will most often cover you for life, which obviously represents pretty good value.

You've now got at least a working knowledge of how to download games for your Iphone, so happy downloading and thanks for reading!
