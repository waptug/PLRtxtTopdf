In the previous lesson, we talked about the Power of Words.

Today we're going to discuss how to make a million dollars in one year.

Does that sound like hype? It is.

You see hundreds of ads online promising to help you make thousands every month...Can they really deliver on that promise? Who knows. The point is there is something in the promise that is enticing, yes? The expectation that you can go from zero to a million dollar a year income is what the promises in those headlines are based on.

You and I know that, unless you win the lottery, the chances of that happening are slim to none.

Do you really want to make a million dollars a year?

You can you know.

For anyone who is making $800,000 each year in gross sales should be able to devise a plan to increase revenues 20% over the coming year. That's' all you have to do to make a million dollars a year.

The question is, how do you get to $800,000 a year in revenue? Make $700,000 in the previous year...and so on and so on.

You must have realistic expectations for sales. If you're earning $50,000 a year now, aim towards $65,000 or even $75,000 the next year. If you're earning $150,000 a year income, shoot for $200,000 to $225,000. Do you see what I'm driving at?

Wealth is not accumulated by hope or promises. Wealth is accumulated by increasing your revenues and decreasing or stabilizing your expenses.

We'll talk about realistic strategies for increasing revenues for your business in the next several lessons.

But I will not make them public because I do not want to reveal what I'm going to reveal to everybody. If you want to continue reading the next lessons for free, just install my Online Wealth Chips & Tips Messenger.
