Using a general resume.
===============

DON'T DO IT! You cannot successfully use the same resume to apply to several different jobs.

Your resume should be custom written for each job you are targeting. When you send out something generic, it shows apathy and lack of motivation. This is NOT the impression you want to send to your potential employers.


Irrelevant content.
============

For example, if you are applying for an accounting position, don't list your lifeguard position you held back in 1989.

Spouses, children, hobbies, and your favorite movie genre are also irrelevant tidbits that should remain private.


Creative fonts.
=========

Even if your choice looks easy to read on your screen, it may not be on someone else's screen.

For example, if I use Arial, Verdana, or Times New Roman, anyone with MS Word can view these fonts. If I were to use my cool Futurama Alien Font, most likely it would look all jumbled up on someone else's system.


"References Available Upon Request"
=======================

This statement is unnecessary. An employer assumes that if you are job searching that you have professional references readily available.


Objective statement.
=============

Your resume needs a clear goal, but the traditional objective statement is outdated. Hiring managers don't care that you want a "challenging position utilizing my experience and creativity..."

Everyone knows the objective is to get the interview. Instead, try using a headline followed by a compelling summary of your relevant skills. This is a better way to present what you have to offer your potential employer.


Using a resume to replace a job application.
============================

A resume is not a job application. The reason for leaving your last job, previous supervisors' names, and rate of pay don't belong on your resume. This is information can hurt you more than help you, so leave it off of your resume.
