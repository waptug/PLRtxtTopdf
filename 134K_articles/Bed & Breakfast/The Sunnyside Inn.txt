The Sunnyside Inn

The tiny town of Yakima, Washington, is home to The Sunnyside Inn. The Sunnyside Inn Bed & Breakfast at the Fordyce House was built in 1919 by Dr. W.E. Fordyce and his wife Ruth Waite Fordyce to serve as his office and residence. Today, after extensive renovation, the Fordyce House continues its history of service entertaining guests, making tired travelers at ease and titillating the palates of guests with many Yakima Valley specialties.

The mixture of sunshine, irrigation water and rich volcanic dust has seen Sunnyside and the vicinity about it turn into the "Fruit Bowl of the Nation" in the production of agricultural foodstuffs. The excellence, amount, volume, taste and color are unequalled.

Each of the thirteen rooms is attractively decorated in a warm country manner; and each and every one has its own private bath along with color television, phone, and daily maid service. Eight of the rooms feature double occupancy with Jacuzzi bathtubs and are a grand place to sit back, unwind and chill out following your day of fun in the sun. The Lola room features the original fittings from this historical 1919 home.

In the morning you will discover a full country breakfast served in the dining area, which includes muffins, pastries and fresh specialties chosen from the plentiful harvest of the Yakima Valley. Take pleasure in things hot off the griddle such as ham, bacon or sausage.

The Sunnyside Inn Bed and Breakfast is located where you can easily visit famous area wineries, farms, orchards and historical sites and experience small town eastern Washington life. There is much to see and do in the valley and you may want to stay longer than originally planned: with nearby golf, tennis, fishing, shopping and so much more to do, you will definitely be find small town living boring.
