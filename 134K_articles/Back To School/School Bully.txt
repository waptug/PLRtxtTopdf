School Bully

	When I was in fifth grade, I had a girl who sat behind me and pulled my hair.  I would turn around and ask her to stop.  She would laugh and then do it again a minute later.  There are all kinds of school bullies, from the innocent but cutting remarks to the violent hitting and punching.  When your kid has a bully at school, something must be done.  What to do will depend on the situation.  Here are some suggestions.
	If your child has a problem during class, ask the teacher to move them to a different desk.  Sometimes the student isn’t bullying your child, but any child that is sitting by them.  I had a daughter who was partnered up with the most difficult student in the class because the teacher thought that my daughter would help him behave.  Instead, she started complaining about school and didn’t want to go anymore.  When I talked to her about the reasons why, I asked the teacher to move her.  It took care of the problem for my daughter.
	If your child is being hurt at school, the teacher and principle need to know.  More than likely, there is a procedure that the school follows with a student who is physically hurting other children.  If they don’t seem to be acting as you feel they should, talk to them again and find a resolution that you can all be happy with.
	If your child is the bully, you need to put a stop to it now.  Hopefully the reasons would be obvious to you.  This is not the type of behavior you want your child to continue.  They need to learn to respect other children and behave properly.
