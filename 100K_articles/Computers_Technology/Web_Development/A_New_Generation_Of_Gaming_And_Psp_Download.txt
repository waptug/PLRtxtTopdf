Gone are the days of spending hours sitting in front of the television as you robotically maneuver a joystick in an effort to control a little yellow circle; the primary goal of which was to devour each and every tiny dot meticulously positioned throughout a maze as it vacillated between running from or chasing after quickly moving ghosts. 

Gone also are the days of carefully moving a cute green frog across a street as you carefully avoid any oncoming traffic; or the days where the hero of our game, on a quest to rescue the frightened heroine from the dreaded giant monster monkey, courageously jumped over barrels and oil tanks thrown by the game's evil villain. 

In essence, gone are the simpler times in which we could be easily entertained by clear-cut video games. Instead, today's modern counterparts are multilayered, graphically intricate games that engage player in a way that could have once only been imagined.

Sony Computer Entertainment has created the PSP (PlayStation Portable System). The PSP System is a handheld, wireless, portable device that allows the users to not only play a number of high quality and multilevel video game products; it allows viewing of prerecorded and live television as well as videos and photos on a widescreen LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). The PSP System also handles playing music and provides connection to the Internet, as well as a wireless connection. 

Although the system offers a multitude of uses, the main trait of the PSP system continues to be the gaming feature.  Through the use of a PSP Download, users have the ability to successfully update the device as well as add a variety of content to their system. 

PSP System users have the ability to choose a PSP Download through connection to the PlayStation website. A PSP Download can be easily integrated into the PSP system by connecting to the PlayStation website directly from the PSP device. Once access to the website is obtained, the user has the ability to obtain a PSP Download for a specific free game. Utilization of this portion of the PlayStation website also allows for downloading of software updates, game demos, game trailers, game audio tracks, wallpaper, and screenshots.   

The PSP System has the ability to download more than one-hundred and thirty-five games. A Content Pack is available free through the PlayStation website. This pack includes pre-selected data that may be downloaded in one collection. 

Movies and photos are also available for download on the PSP system. Through the utilization of a memory stick, this data can been downloaded and saved to the PSP system for use at any time.

Gone are the days of feeling the overwhelming satisfaction of clearing a full level of those little yellow dots, watching your four legged green friend hop safely to the other side of the street, or helping the hero reach his heroin after conquering his giant monkey nemesis. Now, children and adults are able to utilize the PSP System and enjoy their personal choice in a PSP Download. 

Avid gamers as well as entertainment buffs are able to obtain a new level of satisfaction as they explore newly enhanced products, videos, television, music, and games through their PSP system.
