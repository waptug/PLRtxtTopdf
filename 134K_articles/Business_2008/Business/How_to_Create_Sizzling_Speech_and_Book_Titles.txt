How to Create Sizzling Speech and Book Titles

Do you know the name of the book that was written in 1937 and outsold every book except the Bible? It was How to Win Friends and Influence People. This is a great title that is timeless because it focuses on two benefits that most of us want all the time: winning friends and influencing people. 

Another example: What’s Holding you Back? Thirty days to Having the Courage and Confidence to Do What You Want, Meet Whom You Want, and Go Where You Want by Sam Horn. The benefits are: having courage and confidence to meet and go where you want. 

Five ways to design your speech and/or best-selling book titles:

1. Use alliteration [the same letter starts successive words] 
Monday Morning Mindfulness 
Living Your Life 
Sense and Sensibility 

2. Ask a question 
Are You Getting the Love You Want? 
Does Everything Get Better After Fifty? 
Have You Hugged Your Kids Today? 

3. Write a Rhyme 
Niche and Get Rich 
The Cat in the Hat 
Be Funny and Make Money 

4. Use words such as "How", "Secret", "Power" 
How to Succeed in the Speaking Business 
How to Write a Novel in 100 days or less 
The World’s Best Known Marketing Secret 
The Power of Now 

5. The Rule of Three 
Monday Morning Mindfulness 
No Honor, No Guts, No Glory 
Shake, Rattle and Roll 

Tell me a Story After you craft your sizzling speech title, you then need to tell stories to your audience so that you grab and hold their attention. As an engaging speaker, you will want to relate your story to your content. Your own personal stories will make your content very vivid and interesting. 

Screenwriter, Robert McKee says, Stories are the creative conversion of life itself into a more powerful, clearer, more meaningful experience. They are the currency of human contact. Most of us delineate our thoughts visually, so use very descriptive words to help the audience see what they hear from you. 

Use coaching stories that relate to the needs and interests of your audience. For example, if you are trying to enroll small business clients, tell exciting stories about how your satisfied clients benefited from your coaching sessions. 

It’s okay to be funny. If you think funny thoughts, you will live and relive your story as you tell your story. It is best to be in the now. Your words need to create an image in the audience’s mind so that they will remember your story. 

When telling your stories, be dramatic, maintain eye contact, use theatrical gestures, vary your tone and above all … Be a Model of Excellence!
