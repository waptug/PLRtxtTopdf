Then she decided to see if this same "Secret" could work for what most people considered "normal cars." And guess what: * * *

Article Body:
World famous Dr Suzanne Gudakunst has just released her biggest "shocker!" ever ... Her Secret to buying expensive cars for as little as $300 a month! Dr Suzanne made it big on both TV and now the Web - but what most people don't know is that she routinely buys exotic and luxury cars for as little as 50, 50 (or even more!) 

Then she decided to see if this same "Secret" could work for what most people considered "normal cars." And guess what: * * * The SAME Secret held TRUE! * * * Dr Suzanne was now armed with what is now considered by experts at below wholesale buying to be the "Greatest Car Buying Secret" ever discovered! So powerful and amazing it PROVED in her own life that she decided to share it with several close friends to see if they too could apply it successfully. And the SAME THING resulted! 

One good and close personal friend of Dr Suzanne's is another Internet Multi-Millionaire (name withheld for privacy reasons) and who wanted to buy a brand new Lamborghini Murcielago which usually costs $412,700* (*this year's model). After applying Dr Suzanne's secret he was able to get it for:  NO Money down! and just $1,300/month! 

Yeah, yeah ... I know, I know ... these people are already rich ... so why should they get to use the advantages of her secret, right? 
The fact is: Regardless of how much you make (or like most of us, how little!) it doesn't matter. As they say "a penny saved is a penny earned," so imagine saving $250,000 on a super exotic car (which means $250,000 earned!) Or, for the rest of us, what if you saved: $15,000 on your next car purchase, Or ... $400 a month on payments 

These savings quickly add up (and again, BLANK amount saved means BLANK amount earned, regardless of what you put in the BLANKS, right?) So, if after reading this email you STILL insist on being an "idiot" and paying FULL Price when you no longer ever have to, then fine, leave all the biggest savings to the few of us who are smart enough to grab up Dr Suzanne's "Top Secret Car Secret!" Oh, and by the way, with the few of us doing so, the car salesmen will have to screw someone else out of all the money that they are losing to us, so that means "YOU" will be their next victim. 

Unless of course you happen to have a COPY of Dr Suzanne's "Top Secret Car Secret" like we do! So, just to be generous, I'll give you the link** (**But Shhhh! - Don't go blabbing your mouth all over the Web telling everybody else, cuz we have a pretty good thing here as long as everybody else doesn't find out about it!)
