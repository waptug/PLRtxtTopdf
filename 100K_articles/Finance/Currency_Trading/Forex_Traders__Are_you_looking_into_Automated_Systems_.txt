Being in the forex game, I wanted to get an edge and masterfully own every single pip I could possibly get my hand on. Being also that the learning curve was quite opulent and sometimes wasn't really in my favor, I needed an alternative to the hours of technical analysis and research on news and historical data.

Being in the forex game, I wanted to get an edge and masterfully own every single pip I could possibly get my hand on. Being also that the learning curve was quite opulent and sometimes wasn't really in my favor, I needed an alternative to the hours of technical analysis and research on news and historical data.

I was pressed to find a solution that would let me be able to make trades without the aggravation of the fore mentioned. I looked into using EMA crosses, and news trading, and a couple of other crazy things, only to lose more money and turn more hairs to grey over it.

One day I found the Expert Advisor. What an Expert Advisor is, is an automated trading system, ported to Metatrader 4's Trading Platform. The dealbreaker here, is that you need an account with a forex broker, which supports Metatrader 4. There are at least a few dozen forex brokers who use Metatrader, and a couple of them should fit your trading requirements like a glove.

Why should you consider looking into an expert advisor? Easy!

1. They trade while you sleep, and never need rest at all. It is a software module that works with Metatrader 4, and never crashes!

2. They never need a salary, bathroom breaks, sleep, food, benefits, or anything else that a human trader would need.

3. They are very easy to download, install into Metatrader 4, turn on, and throw them to the wolves to start making money! This process from purchase to operation takes not even 10 minutes.

4. 60 Day Money Back Guarantee. Most Expert Advisors have satisfaction guarantees, just in case you are not satisfied with the results that the Expert Advisor provides, or just have a problem with the system.

5. Have a life, be with family or friends. Make the real money and not work a 9-5! You think it is easier said than done, but seriously, the reality is, when you can make a sustainable, survivable income from Forex, you would fire your boss!

6. One I could recommend off of the bat, is Forex Funnel. This Forex Automated Trading System has generated a great work at home income, and has documented proof as well! A system that has made $600,000 in four years time, and $150,000 in one years time.
