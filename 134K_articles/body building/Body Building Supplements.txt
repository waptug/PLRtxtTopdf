Body Building Supplements


If you are serious about body building, you will want to consider adding a body building supplement to your nutritional program.  Supplements are sort of like vitamins.  They add to what you are already doing when eating right for body building and provide you with more of what your body needs to grow muscle.  

You have many choices when it comes to body building supplements.  There are hundreds of brands on the market, and the choice is up to you which one you want to use.  They are all essentially the same, but some companies are more trustworthy than others.  Pick a company that is well known and well-respected who has proven results.

As for what types of supplements you should use, there are basically four different ones that can help you in your workout program.  These include:

* Protein powders
* Creatine
* Glutamine
* Nitric Oxide

Each has its own distinct advantages depending on what you are trying to achieve in your body building program.  Protein helps build strong muscle, creatine combats fatigue allowing for longer, more effective workouts, glutamine helps combat the stress you are putting your body under during a workout, and nitric oxide increases the flow of muscle building agents to skeletal muscle.

Another supplement many body builders use should be avoided.  In order to grow quickly, some body builders will resort to the use of synthetic steroids and growth hormones.  However, these body building supplements can have damaging side effects.  Many of these substances are illegal, and if you are competing in body building competitions, you will be disqualified if they are found in your system.

Body building supplements are generally considered safe to use for most people.  If you are considering using a supplement, you should check with a doctor first.  If you have any underlying conditions, the doctor will be able to tell you if using a specific supplement can help or ultimately hurt you.

Supplements in a body building program are just part of the sports.  You probably won’t find a serious body builder who doesn’t use them.  But be sure to use those that are legal and safe to use.  If they aren’t, you may find you are hurting yourself rather than helping.

Body building supplements can be great tools to help you grow muscles and enhance your workouts.  It’s possible to get by without them, but they can really add to your workouts and help you achieve your body building goals.  Choose your supplements wisely, and use them regularly.  Then keep up with your body building routine and realize great results!
