Are you looking for convenience and less hassle in your life? What if you wouldn't have to depend on cords to trip you up or fool around with? Would that make you're life just a little easier and better? If so, the time is now, and lightweight and bother free has come to the world of the home stereo and the personal computer. The days of tangled cords and wires is a thing of the past.

We've all been there. It's two o'clock in the morning and you can't sleep. You turn on the television, hoping to catch something besides infomercials. A late night movie catches your interest. Just when you are starting to be interested, you're told by someone in the house to turn it down. The noise is keeping them awake.

Or, what about that can't miss football game when the in laws are visiting. Cordless technology could solve this problem. You can sit on the other side of the room and still hear the sound with your own personal surround sound.

The busy housewife with a small baby can utilize a cordless unit by listening to her favorite music while doing chores. She doesn't have to worry the music may wake the baby. The mobility is an added bonus. Being free to walk about while listening to the stereo can make the chores seem less stressful and more relaxing.

Many people are now downloading their music online. The media files have to be transferred to an audio device if you want to run upstairs to listen to them. With a wireless head set, there is no download or transfer to worry about. As long as the file is on the desktop personal computer, you can listen to it anywhere in the house. This is great for someone wanting to listen to an audio file while everyone else is wanting to watch the tube. It saves on battery life as well.

A wire free unit can also come with noise reduction. This is an added benefit when trying to hear your favorite music when the surrounding noise is distracting. An example would be a student studying for an exam by listening to a lecture while the rest of the dorm is in the middle of a party. With the canceling feature, the student can still make the grade by not being interrupted.

It may surprise you to know the cost is rather low for a good quality set. The benefits are well worth the price, which is reasonable by anyone's standards. There are units which offer surround sound quality, such as the Sennheiser line of Quality of headsets...RS-110, RS-120, RS-130 and RS-140. These are not some cheap brittle noise makers or the kind of sets you'd find in a dollar store. No, now you can take the concert hall with you into the basement, in the back yard, or into the attic or while watching your favorite hockey game.

Most of the quality units on the market are light weight and extremely comfortable to wear (like the Sennheiser, Sony and Panasonic brands). They are rechargeable and you don't have to remember to recharge them. It's automatic! After you use them and put them on the storage cradle for storage, is actually the recharger and recharges the headsets automatically.

There are many styles to choose from. It is best to review the product information available for the model you want and buy from suppliers who only sell top of the end headphones...like the www.HeadphoneWarehouse.com Also, there are some things to keep in mind with the bluetooth (wireless) technology. The devices you use the wireless system with must be compatible. Bluetooth has two types.

It would be disappointing to discover your perfect audio head set will not work with your fantastic sounding home music system or desktop personal computer. Go to a quality online retailer for your wireless headphones and you'll be very happy with your new acquisition and the noise you no longer hear.
