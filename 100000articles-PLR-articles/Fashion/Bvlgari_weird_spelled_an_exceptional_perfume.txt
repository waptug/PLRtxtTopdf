Probably the most bizarre spelled perfume name ever, sometimes, if you try to find information on Bvlgari perfume, you will need to search for “Bulgari perfume”,as well as Bvlgari. It is in the nature of our brains to seek and make order out of chaos. “Bvl” just doesn’t have a phonetic equivalent. But “Bul” does, and so perfume sellers continue to market “Bulgari perfume” although this is a misspelling of the product.


Famous Bvlgari

Bvlgari is one of the famous designer brands, they literally everything from sunglasses to watches. They also, of course, make spectacularly posh perfume. They are measured the brand name you want to wear if you are nominated for an Oscar. The Bvlgari brand name is less well known than Tiffany’s, but has a more obsessive and perceptive following. Bvlgari watches, for instance, are considered equivalent to Rolex.
One of the things that make Bvlgari perfume expensive is roses, they are hard to get. How could Roses not be everywhere? They must be everywhere? Well, you would need 4000 pounds of rose petals to yield one ounce of pure essential rose oil. Any perfume perfume made of roses will obviously be quite expensive. One of the most fashionable Bvlgari perfumes is Rose Essentielle, which is typically made up of other scents other than rose, or no one would buy it. It also has blackberry, living mimosa, patchouli and several other flowers whose names makes this writer’s eyes cross.


Testers
Bvlgari perfumes also provide that many other designer perfume makers don’t is that they sell tester sized bottles. You can actually get them online. Amazon sells them. These bottles don’t come with fancy designs and packaging of their larger siblings, but do you want to buy the bottle or the perfume?

You can also check for better prices on Bvlgari perfume on sites like eBay. You may need to deal with a used or opened bottle tough. Never send seller money by wires – that typically indicate a scammer. Check the seller’s rating to read what other buyers think of the seller. Be patient and do a lot of praying. Even for expensive perfumes, when the sniffer is ready, the perfume will appear within your budget.
