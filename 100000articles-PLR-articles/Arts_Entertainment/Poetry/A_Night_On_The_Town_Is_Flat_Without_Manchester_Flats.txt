Thump! Thump! Thump! The music's bass reverberates so loudly you feel like you're standing under a ringing bell. You are not merely hearing the music; you are feeling it! Thump! Thump! Thump! You have to strain your eyes to see anything farther than your dance partner, who is a few feet in front of you.

Flats and Flat
In the United States, "flat" is usually an adjective. But in England, it refers to a group of rooms for living in. Typically they are on a single floor and are part a larger structure. Also, flats usually include a restroom and kitchen. In fact, flats are basically American apartments! After a night or day in town, a Manchester flat is a perfect place to rest up before heading out the next day.
