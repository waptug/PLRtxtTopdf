Technology is taking manifolds with each day passing by whereby once mobile phones, computers used to be considered as technological tools. Then MP3 players and iPods came into picture for them who had a passion for music and entertainment. But now there are portable video players that have captured the market.

These portable video players make it easier for you to take the A/V excitement out from your house onto the road. Portable video players are getting smaller, lighter weight and also at the same time more advanced. Portable DVD players let you watch all your favorite movies in any kind of place whereas digital video portables have other range of capabilities.

Convenient, lightweight portable DVD players are a smash hit in the market. Most of these players are slim, laptop style pieces with a DVD deck and a built in, flip up screen. These usually include a headphone output plus a wide variety of digital and analog outputs for other connection possibilities. Other portable DVD players lack an attached screen but they could be easily plugged into TV monitors wherever you go in a car, boat or vacation house. You have also the option to use one as regular player at your home. There are even portable video players especially designed to be used inside a car some of which could be installed and others can be hooked up for long road trips or put away for regular about town driving.

There are certain other players which rely on digital video files stored on to a tiny hard drive instead of the DVD’s. These players are great when they are used in conjunction with a computer with in-built TV tuner because then you can easily record your favorite TV shows and store them as videos or load them onto your portable and carry them with you. These players usually handle MP3 files and digital photos as well.

It doesn’t matters which type of portable you choose but you should consider buying a pair of headphones separately. Most of the portable players include headphones but you could get better sound by replacing them with an inexpensive pair. 

And if you are used to a great sound at the time when you watch DVD movies on your player, then you should look around for a set of Dolby Digital headphones and you can enjoy impressive surround sound from your portable DVD player.
