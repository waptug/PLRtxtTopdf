Most consumers own several electronic devices that have features that perform the same function. This is because consumer electronics are designed to blend in with the needs that consumers have and are marketed solely on one feature and the other features tend to blend into the background. A cellular telephone will include features such as calculator and calendars, but since these consumer electronics are sold individually, there is little talk about duplicated features in any magazines.

Consumer electronics like personal digital assistants are designed to perform tasks that are identical to tasks performed by larger devices but are used more because they are portable and can be enjoyed in many settings where the larger device will seem inconvenient. Many people will own personal computers and use the connectivity devices to download music to the handheld consumer electronics such as MP3 players and PDA's, but they will enjoy the storage space found on the computer and store musical files until they are needed.

A person has the option of installing global positioning devices into the dash of their automobile or using these consumer electronics from portable devices such as PDA's. Some computer software programs will serve the same purpose and a person will find that they can use the internet search engines to find websites that will perform exact distance calculations from one place to another. All of these consumer electronics will perform the same task but consumers are given a choice in which one they want to use and most users will consider the cost of using each method.

Some people use consumer electronics to help with mathematical calculations. A handheld calculator is very useful to a budget conscious shopper, but will prove to be an invaluable tool for someone who is performing intricate equations for algebra. Some users will need consumer electronics while at work because buying materials for a job site will require a building contractor to know the square root measurements of all building surfaces.

Computer software can be used to calculate the cost of every home remodeling project and consumer electronics like flash sticks can be used to store the files safely until they are needed. Computer technicians can use these devices to store many files that are needed for completing compute repairs, and other consumer electronics can be used to verify if electrical connections are energized or not safe to work on.

Other consumer electronics will make tasks simpler and reduce the cost of building projects. Electronic devices such as stud finders allow building contractors to find objects behind drywall that are not visible with the naked eye. A contractor might need consumer electronics such as heaters to make paint dry faster. When the building is finished, the occupant will rely on other electronic devices to maintain a comfortable temperature throughout the building.

While the design of consumer electronics is angled toward accomplishing a specific purpose, many devices can be used to accomplish a variety of tasks. Electronics are meant to simplify life and serve as forms of entertainment outside the home. Radios are one of the consumer electronics that can provide safety information if it is tuned to the right channel, or it can help keep drivers awake while driving for hours on a busy highway. Some consumer electronics are capable of putting drivers in contact with fire, police or ambulance companies in the event that an accident occurs on the roadways.
