It’s funny how computer companies that were nonexistent a quarter of a century ago are now setting trends and milestones for older and supposedly more established companies. When Microsoft and America Online outsourced some of their services to India and the Philippines, other companies with services ranging from automotive to medical followed suit. When the software company Intuit started utilizing the vast Arizona deserts and plains, others started seeing the possibilities.

Make Yourself At Home

Since then, Arizona has been playing host to huge corporations, most notably America Online, American Express, and Intuit. The state’s high-tech sector experienced a massive growth in employment in software and computers, electronics, aerospace, telecommunications, and engineering. Even Wal-Mart has jumped into the bandwagon.

And it’s not stopping. With such a remarkable development, refinance mortgage Arizona has been increasingly utilized by residents new and old alike. 

It’s The Gold Rush All Over Again

The phenomenon is strangely reminiscent of the gold rush of old when thousands of people all over the world flocked to this area of the continental United States to mine gold. This time, however, gold is in computer chips and it doesn’t look like it will be as ill-fated as the original gold rush, as is apparent from the patronage experienced by refinance mortgage Arizona. 

Instead of a boom town, the state now has several. Housing projects are emerging all over the state like mushrooms in the rain with most of the properties obtained through refinance mortgage Arizona. 

There’s Nothing Like Space To Set The Pace

So why Arizona? It can probably be attributed to the fact that of the state’s 118,000 square miles, only 15% is privately owned. The area is vast and is a veritable minefield of resources that can be used for sensitive high-tech projects, especially in software development, aerospace engineering, and telecommunications. Also, the vastness of the desert provides the perfect camouflage to safeguard top secret projects of a sensitive nature and keeps the risks confined in such a sparsely populated region.

Yes, Arizona is indeed still very much sparsely populated, even with all the housing projects brought about by refinance mortgage Arizona. Of course, safety is always a concern. However, refinance mortgage Arizona has made sure that housing is well away from the technology hub of the area. Besides, the space itself is the best safety that Mother Nature could provide, definitely something that Arizona isn’t in shortage of.

The Environmental Question

With all these technological giants settling all over Arizona, could the state’s many canyons, forests, and reservations be in danger? They might be, but as long as the companies do their part in preserving the environment, Arizona will come to no harm. That’s why companies like Intuit and American Express are setting examples by sponsoring regular clean up drives of the state’s many deserts and mesas. Thankfully, some of the other companies have since followed suit. After all, keeping Arizona as untouched and unharmed as possible is to everyone’s benefit. Why shouldn’t it be a priority?
