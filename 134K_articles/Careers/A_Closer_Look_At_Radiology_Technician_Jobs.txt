Job description

What, exactly, is a radiology technician? If you've ever gotten an X-ray or an ultrasound at the doctor's office, then you've dealt with a radiology technician. Radiology techs are trained to use X-ray machines, ultrasound machines, positron emission scanners, and various other types of machines to view the inside of the human body. The information gathered from these scans is put into image form, and the tech is in charge of developing the images. The physician then uses them to help diagnose any illnesses the patient may have.

Some radiology technician jobs are highly specialized, dealing with certain types of equipment and scans. All radiology technicians are expected to deal directly with the patient; in fact, part of the job description is to prep the patient for the scan and make sure they are comfortable.

When X-rays and other potentially hazardous machines are involved, radiology technicians must set up the machines properly and ensure that the room is arranged safely. Lead screens and shields must be arranged at a certain distance from the X-ray, and the room must be properly sealed. Radiology technicians are well-trained in all of these aspects of handling X-rays and other machines.

Techs work closely with physicians and health care practitioners, who are in charge of analyzing the images produced by the X-rays or other procedures. Most general physicians will set up appointments for their patients with radiologist techs, and specify what types of procedures need to be performed. The radiology technician is in charge of getting clear and correct images as specified by the physician.

Some radiology techs, such as sonographers, work specifically with a certain type of procedure. Sonographers, for example, work with machines that produce images by sending sound waves through the body. In these cases, the tech is also trained in how to interpret the results, and they will often assist the physician in reading the results and diagnosing and treating the patient's illnesses.

Requirements of the job

Radiology technician jobs are plentiful in today's medical world, and those with the proper training shouldn't have any trouble finding a job. Techs are required to have a high school diploma or its equivalent. They must then attend and graduate from a training program that specializes in radiology. Training programs generally last from two to four years, and can be found either through schools or through hospitals and clinics.

Types of Radiology Technician jobs

Radiology technicians work under a wide range of conditions. Traveling radiology techs go around to various hospitals that do not have trained techs on staff, and stay for a few months in each location. Radiology techs may also work in clinics, laboratories, nursing homes, or in private homes. The type of job you choose to pursue is entirely up to you.

The field of radiology technician jobs is advancing quickly, and there's never been a better time to get involved. With a shortage of radiology techs in the field, finding a job is easy, and many hospitals are eager to hire and help train newly certified techs.

Learn valuable skills with true opportunity for advancement, and give yourself the chance to really make a difference with a radiology technician job.
