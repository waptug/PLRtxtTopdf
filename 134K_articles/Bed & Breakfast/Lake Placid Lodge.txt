Lake Placid Lodge

Located on the shores of beautiful Lake Placid, in New York, this is the perfect spot for couples on their honeymoon-or for men (or women) who want to pop the question.  He staff here will gladly help make this the most memorable experience of a lifetime.

This lakeside lodge is a charming Adirondack retreat.  Built in the 1920's at or near the water's edge, these cabins have all been skillfully renovated to include king or queen-size featherbeds, large stone fireplaces, sitting areas, pleasing to the eye rustic furniture and wet bars. All have lush bathrooms, with enormous soaking tubs and spacious separate showers. Gigantic picture windows expose out of this world lake and mountain vistas. A full Adirondack breakfast is included for all visitors,

Whether you visit in winter or summer, there is always something to do.  Winter can have you participating in a dog sled ride, skiing or ice fishing.  Summer provides opportunity for hiking, boating, playing gold, fishing, horseback riding or tennis.  For the couples, you can take a canoe out to a private island for a leisurely day alone together.

For those who want to cozy up inside, the cabins offer working fireplaces, in-room modem links and a wet bar.  The tubs are large and perfect for a nice long hot bubble bath. 

While all the cabins are spectacular, one stands above the rest. Owl's Head is a very special cabin. Set just a step or two from the edge of the lake, the cabin's private porch is fringed by a small, tumbling brook. The room has a vast hand-crafted stone fireplace and a king-size featherbed shaped from a tree. In the vast bathroom, there is a two-person jacuzzi jet tub, a dry sauna, and a six-headed steam shower. This spacious, one-room suite is the most luxurious and romantic.
