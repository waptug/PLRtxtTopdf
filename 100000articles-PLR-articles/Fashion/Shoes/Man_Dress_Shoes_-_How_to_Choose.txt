Article Body:
Which man dress shoes you pick may at first seem like a simple choice. You might shop around, see something that looks nice, and then pick your favorite color. While this might work, there are many things to consider that might not even cross your mind.

The first thing to consider is what else you are wearing. I know, seems simple, but knowing if this is going to be worn with business casual dress (slacks/dress shirt) as opposed to a full suit does make a difference. With a full suit, you want the nice, traditional polish shoes to compliment the suit, as that is the look you are putting forward with wearing a suit. If you are are dressing more casual, as most places are in recent times, you might consider a comfortable pair of oxfords or rockports. After all, if you don't have to wear full dress shoes, why not just wear a comfortable shoe.

The average person steps 4,000 - 5,000 times a day. That's roughly 3 miles. This can heavily impact which style of man dress shoes you wear, as well as how the padding and insole are manufactured. Quality speaks for itself, as the saying goes. How well the shoes will hold up is a definite thing to consider.

The above are just some items to consider when you're shopping for man dress shoes, and things normal men don't think about when they're out and decide to grab a new pair of shoes. Shopping online can make it drastically easier to find precisely what you want at the price you want.
