CD replication is process of producing commercial quality CDs by means other than burning writable discs i.e. cd duplication. CD replication is the process of manufacturing compact discs, which involves the creation of a glass master from an original master, the creation of a nickel stamper from that glass master, the injection molding of clear optical-grade polycarbonate substrates (clear discs) from that stamper, and the metaling and lacquering of those substrates to produce CDs. The same procedure followed in case of DVDs is known as dvd replication. Generally, DVD or cd replication is also known as storage replication, but technically, DVD or CD replication is also referred to as 'pressing' or 'molding'. 

CD replication is the original method of manufacturing CDs. Large CD molding machines are used to getting started with cd replication. The CD molding machines use raw materials to create basic CDs. Using the glass master, the data or audio on the original master is stamped on the basic CDs. That is why, CDs have a silver look. The silver tone, which is actually the aluminum, helps to reflect the laser that is used when you play your CDs.  

CD replication is an automated process that is usually used for producing higher quantities CDs, where it's very important to get the price “per disc” as low as possible. Generally, the cost “per disc” in cd replication becomes pretty affordable when you order greater than 1000 pieces (CDs). So, you can look to cd replication, if you are looking to produce greater quantities of CDs. CD replication process becomes far more cost effective, when you require over 1,000 units. 

CD replication is the process that is often used in the big CD businesses that deal in massive production of CDs. Like cd duplication or burning, you can’t accomplish the process of cd replication single-handedly by just using your personal PC. As mentioned above, cd replication requires large 'pressing' or 'molding' machines that are good for CD or DVD manufacturing businesses rather than having them at your home; it’s too cumbersome and expensive to have cd replication machines at home.
