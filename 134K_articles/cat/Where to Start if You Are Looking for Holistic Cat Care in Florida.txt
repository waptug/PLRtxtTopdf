Do not think about having a cat because you are bored. How about on the days when you are no longer in the same state? With cats, you can't be all too sweet and hugging one moment and the next days, you don't even throw glances at them.

This will be taken seriously by your cat. This may even lead to depression and anxiety. You have to always put their feelings into consideration. Yes, they can also feel. They can love. And therefore, they can get hurt. Cats also feel jealous when the attention they were getting before suddenly shifts onto another pet or even another human being.

You have to slowly integrate the new face or the new pet in the whole system. You cannot act on an impulse and expect your cat to absorb everything. And be considerate. If the new pet is cuter, don't let it show. Shower all your pets with same kind of love as well as attention.
