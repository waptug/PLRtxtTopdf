How To Build A Home Internet Business

This involves advertising your home based business all over the internet-whether this includes pay-per-click ads, writing articles,building links to similar home income sites,banner advertising,or writing a newsletter. These are all very important methods to advertise your home internet business.

2. It is so important that you try and get a vast number of repeat customers to your site. Offering a free email newsletter is a very good example,and with your own autoresponder account set up,your visitors will be able to subscribe to your free email newsletter thus receiving quality content and information, with the result to purchase products /services from your website. Your list will grow,and effectively over time your sales will increase.

3. Also ensuring that your website is search-engine friendly is another very important factor. Achieving excellent ranking at Google,Yahoo and MSN for search results relating to your website virtually guarantees vast numbers of targeted traffic. Best of all this traffic is free. You can optimize your website for your chosen keywords yourself, but i suggest you research keywords first. Overture has an excellent keyword tool. Do a Google search for "overture keyword tool".

4. Building back-links to your website,is another great step to advertise on the internet. Linking to other similar niche websites makes the search engines index your website far quicker,and possibly giving you better search rankings.

5. Writing and submitting articles to article directories and other webpages is an effective and free way to advertise your site too!. This has to be done on a regular consistent basis to grow your online presence. The author resource box gives you an opportunity to anchor back to your website, using a targeted keyword or phrase.

For a fee,you can hire a ghostwriter, to write articles for you-this is a great idea if you have money but no time to write!.

6. Post in work at home forums, with an anchor link to your website in your signature.These ideas can be totally free,and effectively your posts will be indexed by the search engines-giving you another free source of traffic.

7. Ppc or pay-per-click advertising is another way to receive targeted traffic to your website.

The advantage of this is almost immediate-once you set an account up,add relevant keywords and phrases, write your ads and how much you want to spend etc-the traffic flows to your site.

But

It can be very costly,to the newbie or unexperienced. Tweaks and changes are to be made to find the most clickable ads which have a high click through rate,and which cost pennies/cents rather than pounds/dollars. Google, yahoo ,and msn are the big three search engine ads companies.But you can use the smaller ad companies too!.

Adding Content To Your Home Internet Business

Where your website or blog is concerned, it is extremely important to add new content continually, not only to please the search engines, but to add interest and excitement to your site also. You can expand your site by adding relevant but different keywords to new pages,this will attract new visitors,and ultimately new sales. Continually monitor your keyword rankings in the search engines, and keep a watchful eye on your competition. Make adjustments and improvements where necessary.

Over time-as the presence of your home based business increases-so will the total volume of traffic to your website. As a rule of thumb- a goal of 400 unique visitors per day can be achieved by using the methods in this article.

Maintenance For Your Website

To be effective in maintaining your website,you need to regularly check that all your links are working,check download times, remove broken links,add different graphics,add fresh content. Keep your website up-to-date.

Making Changes To Your Website

There may be a time in the future that you are receiving thousands of targeted traffic to your site-but you are not making a steady stream of online income. What do you do. Take a very good look at your site. Are your adverts relevant to your products. Can your visitors find what they are looking for easily. Is your website easy to navigate and search. Is your website displaying other people's ads or banners.Is your sites colour scheme very bright or too dark,or are you offering out of date information or non-relevant content.

Join a home based business forum,and ask to submit your site for an online review.There are also many forums dedicated to search engine optimisation, link building, writing and submitting articles. These forums will give you honest and precise feedback on your particular query or problem.There will be always someone to help you.
