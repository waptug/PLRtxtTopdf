}Who Needs an Air Ambulance?\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 We all hope
 that we never experience a trauma or medical emergency that requires treatment.  
No one ever thinks they will be force to deal with a severe or critical medical 
condition that requires extensive medical treatment and care.  Although we never
 want to be in such a circumstance, it is important to be informed about such issues
.  When patients require medical attention during transport, the typical method 
of travel involves an ambulance, but in specific cases, standard medical transportation
 is not enough.  An air ambulance may be just what the doctor ordered.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 What medical
 conditions and critical situations call for the use of an air ambulance?  Each 
case is different based on the specific medical needs of the patient.  There is 
no exact rule of thumb, but some basic guidelines do exist to determine which patients
 require the use of an air ambulance.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 If the patient
\u8217\'92s doctor feels that the patient should not travel by air with conventional
 airlines due to their specific medical needs, the doctor will order travel by an
 air ambulance.  Numerous companies and organizations exist to safely transport 
patients in this way.  Each company has their own specific requirements for staff
 on board the flight.  Special medical circumstances may call for specific medical
 teams to fly aboard the air ambulance with the patient.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Here are 
some examples of medical conditions that may indicate a need to travel by air ambulance
:\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 *Patients
 suffering from respiratory conditions that require ventilators\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 *trauma patients
\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 *patients
 with neurological conditions that require intra cranial monitoring\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 *IABP patients
 that require balloon pumps\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 *patients
 with multiple IV drips\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 *transplant
 patients\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 *obstetric
 patients requiring intensive care \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 *NICU patients
\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The patients
 that require continuous medical monitoring and the use of specialized medical equipment
 are excellent candidates for travel by air ambulance.  There is no plausible way
 for a patient with severe medical conditions to travel by conventional methods 
while achieving comfort and appropriate medical care.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 When time
 is of the essence, standard flights would not be speedy enough to safely transport
 a patient to their destination.  Also, it is impossible to spontaneously board 
a conventional flight with an entire medical staff and equipment.  For this reason
, doctors and patients choose to travel by air ambulance.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Air ambulance
 services are most commonly thought of as the helicopters that fly accident victims
 from the scene of a car crash to the nearest hospital that is capable of providing
 proper treatment for the severe injuries sustained in the crash.  On the contrary
, air ambulance services include so much more than just this sector of service.

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 An air ambulance
 may be a chopper,\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 But it also
 can include planes such as turboprops and jets.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The type 
of aircraft used should be determined by the patients needs, as well as, by the 
distance traveled.  For example, a patient should typically be transported by a 
jet when they require air ambulance transportation for distances greater than 500
 miles.  This is due to the time traveled, necessary stops to refuel small planes
, the patient\u8217\'92s comfort and stress level.   \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Traveling
 by air ambulance may not be an experience that you want to add to your to-do list
, but it may be medically necessary in the future.  Patients who require constant
 medical attention, the use of specific medical equipment, or have numerous IV drips
 may require the use of such services.  Should the doctor feel that this specialized
 service is beneficial, you will be glad that the air ambulance services are available
.  \par}
