You know, nobody likes a cheater. But when it comes to discovering video game cheats, "cheating" isn't what you're doing. I prefer to think of it as "discovering shortcuts, tips and tricks," or video game hints. 

Video games have gotten so complex, since the days of Rubix Cubix and Donkey Kong, that the game authors have purposely thrown in some back doors and other shortcuts to aid the exhausted players. However there is a problem, most of these back doors are so well hidden that these same authors have to leak the game cheats or no one would ever find them on their own. 

Video game cheat sheets, codes and game hints are sort of useless if you don't own any video games. Well I'm sure if you have games you probably beat them fast with the aid of cheat sheets, but with online video game stores you can beat more and pay less! 

Any web site worth visiting will not only have video game reviews and cheats for you to peruse, but they will also have game walkthroughs. Video game walkthroughs differ from cheats in that they actually "walk you through" the process of achieving some goal. Video game cheats, on the other hand, are often cryptic one or two liners like "Enter xx892 in the password field." 

There are different types of video game reviews. Each have their good and bad points. The other most common writer of video game reviews are the actual end users. While an end user will generally have spent a great deal more time actually playing the various video games on the most popular video game systems, you'll often find that they are men and women of little words. It's not unusual to see a review that says "Wow! Kick A** man. I love it!" Now, that's probably actually saying quite a bit about a particular video game, but -- your opinion may vary. 

You should remember that you don't want to invest in a video game until at least a couple of people have taken the time to write a review of the game. Of course, if everyone took this advice then there wouldn't be any video game review on any game web sites, because everyone would be waiting for someone else to write the review. 

Right up there with video game reviews are video game previews. A video game preview is a lot like a movie trailer. They bundle all of the really thrilling parts together and give you a quick peek hoping that you'll believe that the entire video game is actually as cool as the 90 seconds of video game previews that they let you get a view at. 

The video game industry is at a crossroads. With more and more people clicking the play game online switch, and video game systems like XBox 360 and all of the XBOX video games out there, all the other gaming is considered back in the day. As more and more video game systems opt for Internet connectivity like the new XBOX 360, you're likely to find that you never have to play video games alone again.
