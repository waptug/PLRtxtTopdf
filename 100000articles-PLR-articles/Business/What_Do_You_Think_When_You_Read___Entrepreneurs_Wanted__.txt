What would you think if you saw a sign that read, "Entrepreneurs Wanted"? Many people would see such a sign as a rare opportunity to fulfill a lifelong dream. They've long envisioned a life where they could make their own hours, follow their passions, and not have to feel as though the people above them are trying to keep them down. Others would view such a sign with suspicion. They might ask, "What's the catch?" They might even come up with a list of reasons why they can't take a chance, begin a new self-made career, and become more successful than they ever thought possible.

While a degree of skepticism can be healthy, all too often people talk themselves out of a business opportunity because, well, they're scared. They might even look at the lives of successful people and think that those people were simply lucky; that they were at the right place at the right time. In fact, the difference between those people who are incredibly successful and those who grind it out in an unfulfilling job day in and day out is that the successful people seize opportunities that come their way. The nine-to-fivers may look longingly at opportunities, but let them slip through their fingers. 

Truth be told, there's never been a better time to find a business opportunity and follow your dreams. To a large extent, the Internet has leveled the playing field. If you have a computer and online access, there are unparalleled opportunities to create wealth. The question becomes, how do you separate the wheat from the chaff? How do you know when an opportunity is the real deal? 

First, you need to drop any notion of finding success with multi-level marketing. While multi-level marketing may have made a few people at the top wealthy, no MLM today is creating wealth for those who are just joining.

Second, you need to forget direct sales. Very, very few people are have a natural talent for selling; for the rest of us, direct sales is difficult or impossible, and a sure path to frustration, discouragement, and failure. 

Third, you need to embrace a company that has a proven system for marketing. So many Internet businesses fail today because business owners simply don't know how to market. After all, you can have the most attractive website in the world, but if you can't drive traffic to your site, you'll never see a penny. 

Fourth, you need to find a great product. In this Information Age, the product should be related to the Internet and have enormous growth potential. 

Fifth, you want to find affiliate with a company that will take the time to understand your personal and financial goals, and help you in any way they can to reach those goals. Essentially, it's the reverse of what you often find in the corporate world - where the people at the top keep you down. You want to find a business opportunity where the people at the top - the wealthmasters, so to speak - reach down and give you a hand up. They should be able to set you up with the carbon copy of a system that almost runs on auto pilot. They should have eliminated the need for selling, explaining, bothering people, and pitching friends and family. Instead, they should have perfected a powerful, automated, turnkey marketing system that provides you with the best home business opportunity on the planet.

When you've found that kind of company, you'll be glad that you took advantage of the "Entrepreneurs Wanted" sign!
