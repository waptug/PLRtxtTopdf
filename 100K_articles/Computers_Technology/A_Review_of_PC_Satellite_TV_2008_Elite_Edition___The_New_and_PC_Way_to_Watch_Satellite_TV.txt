Article Body:
The entertainment industry has recovered from the “shock” and now the software developers are taking action. Internet satellite TV is a great way for watching Internet TV and PC satellite TV is here to stay. Developers are finally able to design high quality software which allows you to access thousands of free television channels via satellite for free. The software is not free of course but there are no monthly costs, this deal is absolutely affordable for most of us.

I bought several software packs and tested with them for about 2 months.  PC Satellite TV 2008 Elite Edition seemed to be the only one living up to my standards. This site really offered the best price and quality that I have seen so far. This pack comes with over 3,000 channels at a onetime fee of $49.95. 

I also tested among others a different brand PC Satellite TV with a price of $39.95 but not only the picture quality was significantly less but he had also less channels and fewer interesting bonuses. This 2008 Elite Edition is the cheapest for the best quality that I have yet to see for PC satellite TV. I looked at this deal very doubtful; according the website the retail price was $350.00 and now with this “special limited offer” I would only pay for this PC satellite TV software pack $49.95. Although this price difference made me very skeptical I decided to buy the software. If I didn’t liked the quality I could easily return it within 8 weeks from the date of purchase.

I ordered it online with immediate download and I had it set up within 5 minutes. This PC satellite TV 2008 software pack really did what it claimed and was very easy to use. I was amazed with the quality since I’ve tested several others with a higher price tag. Now you see money isn’t everything. 

PC satellite TV 2008 Elite Edition costing a onetime fee of $49.95; what do you get for this? They offer more than 3,000 channels from around the world. This pack includes among others more than 60 movie channels, over 70 Sports channels and more than 120 premium channels with MTV overdrive, the Broadway Network, the Game Network but also many HDTV channels and many many others. The PC satellite TV Elite Edition software is sold with several bonuses of which one is additional access to 1,500 radio stations from around the world! 

PC satellite TV allows you to capture the channels from any location in the world. All you need is an internet connection and you can watch it anywhere you like. When it comes to PC satellite TV 2008 Elite Edition this one truly stands out from the rest. They offer a money back guarantee if you’re not satisfied. I would give this offer a nine out of ten and that’s because of the mentioning of the ridiculous discount otherwise I would have given it a perfect ten.
