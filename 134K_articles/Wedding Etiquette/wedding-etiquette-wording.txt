But thankfully, now there are some things that can be handed over to other people like the wedding planner, a member of the family or even the clergy.<br><br>

The announcement:<br><br>

The engagement can be announced to both families in an intimate gathering. However, the law requires that the union be posted in an ad as public announcement of their nuptial. The wedding etiquette wording for this can be kept to a minimum. <br><br>

The details include, the name of the couple and their parents, the date and location of the wedding and the reception information. More elegant announcements can run a full-page story about the couple’s history but members of the elite society mostly do this wedding etiquette wording.<br><br>

The invitation: <br><br>

After establishing your guest list, it is time to send out the invitations. The wedding etiquette wording is very important and must be written while considering the marital status of the couple’s parents and the couple themselves.<br><br>

As more and more people get divorced, the wedding etiquette wording has evolved to accommodate the changes. If all the parents are divorced, the invitation should include all parents' names, with the bride's parents first. The mothers should be written down before names of their ex-husbands.<br><br>

It is important to note that wedding etiquette wording dictates that the invitation contains the following: name of the couple, their parents, the date and location of the wedding, wedding attire requirements, the map to the wedding and reception area, the bridal registry information and other details such as a wedding website of the couple.<br><br>

As a matter of wedding etiquette wording, all the wedding invitations must come from the bride’s side, even for the friends of the groom. They should be sent out six weeks before the wedding day.

The wedding vows:<br><br>

Traditionally, wedding vows are spoken to each other as dictated by the clergy. However some couples prefer to make theirs special by making personalize d vows.

The toast:<br><br>

Prior to the wedding reception, the family should be aware of the program. At this stage, the host should have informed the concerned parties of the wedding etiquette wording speeches they will make.

The thanksgiving:<br><br>

Another speech that needs wedding etiquette wording is the one given by the couple at the end of the program. The couple makes an expression of gratitude to the bride and groom’s families, guests and everyone behind the wedding event.
