independent contractor

There are many people out there who are in demand, and a good independent contractor is one of them. The reason for this is because there are so many bad ones. I shouldn’t say there are a lot of bad ones, but the ones that make the news are swindling people and doing a lousy job, and they are giving their peers a bad name. When you need to find someone to help with building a home or remodeling, you do have to do your homework. You will probably find someone good, but you should never just assume that this is the case.

You don’t want to find out that you have hired a bad independent contractor after the job has started. You want to know before you agree to hire them or give them any amount of money. The best way to be sure that you have someone good is to find your independent contractor by word of mouth. If you know anyone that has hired someone with good results, you should ask them for a recommendation. Most people will happily share this type of information with you, as they know it is often hard to find someone good and who will work with you instead of on their own schedule.

Don’t be afraid to ask an independent contractor for references, and find out if they are bonded and insured. You should never hire anyone who is not, even if it means you can save some money. If they do something wrong, or someone gets hurt, you are open to being sued by them, or you will have to pay for all of the damage they have caused. If they do the job wrong, it will be your expense for them to fix it. You should know this information before you entertain the idea of hiring any independent contractor.

Also remember to have a clear plan and timetable set up before you tell the independent contractor you have chosen that you want them to start the job. Make sure you have a good estimate of how long it is going to take for them to finish the job, and what will happen if they run into problems. You don’t want to hire an independent contractor that will work for you when they have the time, and that might leave you wondering if your project will ever be completed. You will find many great and honest workers out there, but it never hurts to be sure you are getting a good deal before you agree to anything. Protect yourself and your investment by doing your homework.
