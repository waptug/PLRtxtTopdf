Article Body:
If you've always dreamed that you would be your own boss someday, don't worry. It's not too late. With many Internet businesses today, there are people who have gone before you who will train you and help you succeed along the way. You just have to know where to find them.

Online Business Challenges

Some of the online business challenges you might face include a lack of advertising dollars, lack of knowledge about the Internet in general, and the overwhelming task of designing and updating your website. 

Also, keep in mind that when you own your own business, you'll be responsible for your own accounting and taxes. As with any home based business, an online business requires self-discipline and hard work. Though there are many responsibilities, the rewards can far exceed the challenges.

Mentors for Your Home Business

When you sign on for any income opportunity, be sure there are mentors available who can help you get started. You can learn from them and avoid many pitfalls. A mentor can show you how to get started with your own website, how to increase cash flow, how to build your customer base, and how to operate your business for future profits.

With some business opportunities, a mentor will be provided for you when you join. This person should be skilled and knowledgeable. They should offer proof of their own success and be willing to help when you have questions. It's best to learn from the mistakes of others than to jump right into opportunities ignorantly.

Investments for Online Business

With any online business, you'll likely be required to invest some money at the start. Whether you're starting your own company selling products or services, or planning to join another company to sell their goods and services, you'll likely be required to pay a fee to get started. Consider this money to be an investment, not merely a fee. Think ahead to the return on your investment. Ask your mentor how much you can potentially earn before getting started. 

If you join an opportunity where you can earn from the investment of those who sign up under you, then be sure the investment amount and compensation amount is enough to earn a good income without scaring away new prospects. With any product or service, there is always a price threshold that newcomers are willing to pay. Be sure the company you are working with has already tested their pricing so you won't have to waste time trying it yourself.

Set Realistic Goals

Ask your mentor to help you set realistic goals at the start. You probably won't start out making a fortune, but with realistic goals, you'll feel that you are accomplishing something. Set short-term and long-term online business goals. The goals should include how many prospects you should contact and how many sales you need to make to reach your goals.

Keep focused on your goals and be sure to follow the lead of your mentor. You'll find owning a home based business to be enjoyable and lucrative once you know how to do it.
