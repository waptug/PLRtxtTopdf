The doctors and researchers are looking for answers related to Mesothelioma cure but have not found any. Before we discuss about mesothelioma cure, it is necessary to know about what is mesothelioma and what are its possible causes. Mesothelioma is a rare cancer of the lining of the lungs and abdomen. High Asbestos exposure is the only known cause of mesothelioma cancers. Asbestos is a natural fibrous mineral that was widely used in the construction process, building material and many manufacturing units. Asbestos breaks into minute particles that float into the air, can be easily inhaled and settle on the clothes of workmen, leaving them and their family members prone to many health hazards. 

Understanding Its Symptoms – A Step towards Mesothelioma Cure: 

An understanding of mesothelioma symptoms can help in the process of mesothelioma cure. Some common symptoms of mesothelioma are difficulty in breathing, chest pain, and chronic cough. However, many times this disease lies in asymptomatic in the body, which makes mesothelioma cure an impossible task. Once detected, the chances of survival of an average mesothelioma patient are very bleak. 

The options for Mesothelioma cure depend upon the different stages of the disease. In the first stage the treatments options depends on factors such as patient’s age, general health, organ affected and the size of tumor. Surgery is used for mesothelioma treatment and cure in the first stage. The doctors remove the tumor and the nearby tissues with a surgical process. However, the doctors use a combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy if the tumor has witnessed enormous growth. 

Fluid collection in the chest and abdomen takes place in the advance stages of mesothelioma. Mesothelioma cure in these stages involves draining of the fluid to reduce discomfort. This process of treatment is known as Thorancentesis or Paracentesis. After this, the doctors use Surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Treatment and efforts for mesothelioma cure can suffer a severe jolt if the disease strikes back. In that case, the treatment depends on the location of recurrence, and the patient’s medical history. 

What If the Efforts For Mesothelioma Cure Fail? 

As we have discussed the survival chances of mesothelioma patients are bleak and the possibility of mesothelioma cure are rare. In that case it is necessary to make the patients aware that they are legally entitled to claim compensation for the medical expenses, loss of income, lost earning capacity, pain and the mental trauma they are undergoing. Though the award of compensation cannot bring about mesothelioma cure or compensate for the loss of life, yet it can provide some relief to the mesothelioma victims and their family members.
