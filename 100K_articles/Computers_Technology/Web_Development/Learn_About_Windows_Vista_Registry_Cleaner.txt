Microsoft Windows Vista is the most sought after operating system now-a-days. What is most fascinating about Windows Vista is its interface. The interface is comprised of an animated see-through window that has a touch of graceful and subtle color along with a brand new Start menu. While this many be the case, keeping the system efficient and effective is still the key interest of users and computer professionals. Windows Vista Registry Cleaner is one such utility that is needed to maintain the operating system in good shape.

The registry is catalog of all information about the software, hardware and preferences of the user along with all the settings details. A registry key in Vista operating system is created or modified or deleted every time new software program has been installed or uninstalled. This is the case even when software programs are used.

Any error that occurs during installing or uninstalling of software in Windows Vista is also stored along with the error application in the registry. This causes the registry to be crammed with orphaned or corrupted entries. The registry also gets stuffed with invalid programs that you may have removed from your system long ago. This causes the resources of the system to choke and this considerably slows down the Windows Vista computer.

Registry Cleaner is, often, used to counter software problems in Windows Vista based computers as well as to optimize the system performance. It basically removes the invalid entries from the computer. But the problem that goes with badly developed Registry Cleaner is that it may remove useful programs keys, which may be useful for running your favorite software. Hence a good Registry Cleaner would scan the system for any dubious entry that may harm your system. It would also make sure that the suspicious entry does not affect any software that has already been installed and ones that are in use.

If any problems are detected by the Windows Vista Registry Cleaner after it analyzes the vista system, you can view each of these issues and ask for a detailed explanation of that particular problem. On the other hand, you can choose for an automatic correction of the errors. But you must remember to take a back up of all registry keys that you require to delete before you run the Registry Cleaner to make sure you are always safe.
