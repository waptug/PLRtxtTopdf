School Routine

	When school begins again, it takes my family a few weeks to adjust from the carefree days of summer to the strict schedule that always accompanies school.  I’ve done what I could before school started to ease my kids back, but I’ve found that having a regular routine once school has started helps make the adjustment quicker.
	Each weekday is pretty much the same at my house.  We get up at the same time and each child is responsible for making their bed, picking up their clothes, getting dressed, and eating breakfast.  I wake up at the same time each day to help them where needed.  They have picked out their clothes the night before and know where everything is that they need for the day.  
	Homework has been completed the night before and is ready in their backpack.  Part of our morning routine actually begins at night.  The kids are bathed and everything is put away for the following day.   
	The morning happens the same way each school day.  They know what to expect, what time to leave the house, and what to get ready.  They are established into a routine, whether they are aware or not.  The t.v. stays off, which helps eliminate distractions.  
	Following a routine can set good habits.  Children handle daily stress better when they know what to expect.  When a routine is established and followed, it allows kids to have some control over their day because they already know what will be happening.  It makes getting ready for school each day much simpler.  
	Starting good habits for the day will help your child as they get older.  Having a nutritious meal and completing proper grooming is a part of our daily lives and it is always good to start our children out on these good habits.
