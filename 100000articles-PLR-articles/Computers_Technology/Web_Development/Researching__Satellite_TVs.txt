Satellite TV receivers can be ordered with a DVR (digital video recorder) that allows you to record your favorite TV shows in digital format.

Although cable TV nowadays offers digital cable broadcast it’s limited by channels and the area you live in.

Cable TV uses analog signal while satellite TV uses digital signal. There are cards that use the PC’s infrastructure to decode satellite signals and allow users to enjoy free-to-air digital television and radio programs. Digital signals are beamed from satellites to users and these are of three primary types: signals received directly by the viewer, that received by local television affiliates for distribution, or reception by headends for distribution through cables.

Satellite provides a 100% digital service plus the availability of HDTV. All channels are digital quality and offer HD (high definition) television services that are compatible to your satellite TV service.

Once you decide on the provider or service, you will know what type of equipment you will need to purchase.
