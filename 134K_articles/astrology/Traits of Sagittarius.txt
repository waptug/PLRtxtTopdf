Traits of Sagittarius

If there was a “most likely to succeed” Zodiac sign, it would likely be Leo.  

On the other hand, if there was a “most likely to put his foot in his mouth,” that would be Sagittarius.

He doesn’t mean to, of course.  He does mean well.  Sagittarius is the Archer, and every now and then, one of those arrows is totally off target.  They are creatures of the extreme—either that arrow will hit perfectly, dead center, or it will rebound off the target directly back into the archer’s face.

Sagittarius thinks big.  He doesn’t have time or patience for details, and that’s where his weakness lies—because such things as social graces and tact can fall into those “little details” sections.  Likewise, a job that demands attention to detail, like assembly line work, would leave an Archer breaking his bow in impatience and frustration.  Deep down, Sagittarius is the most insecure of all the signs.

The Archers are messy and scruffy, the “Oscar Madison” of the Zodiac.  Ironing shirts and combing hair can easily become one of those little details, too.  Don’t expect a neat and orderly house when there’s a Sagittarius living there.

Like the Centaur that the constellation Sagittarius represents, Archers love to travel.  Even better is traveling in something as rough and ragged as they are, four wheel drive and covered in mud.

Archers do well in entertainment.  They want to be liked, due to that deep insecurity, and they want an audience, because of their high level of pride.

Sagittarius generally leans one of two ways.  One, they are intellectual, thinking big, well read, opinionated, and willing to debate for hours on end—though often having a problem admitting when they’re wrong.  Or two, they thrive on athletic competition.  If you want to spot the Sagittarius in the backyard football game, look for the muddiest member of the winning team.
