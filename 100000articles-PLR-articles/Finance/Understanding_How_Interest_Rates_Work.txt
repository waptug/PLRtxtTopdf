Interest rates are a complex subject. In some cases you will want them to be high, in others you'll want them to be as low as possible. But, what they are is not something that you or I can change. It is determined on many things especially on the way the economy is moving. So, how much you will pay for that car or the home you wanted and how much you will make on your savings accounts is determined by interest rates and factors that you can not control. 

But, there are many ways in which you can do well with interest rates. One of the most important things that the average consumer can do to lower interest rates that will effect them is to simply shop around. There are many deals to be had when it comes to these rates. You should consider looking not only at your bank and those in your area but also (and especially) at the banks and lending institutions on the web. You can truly save money by shopping around. 

It also helps considerably to get a low interest rate if you have good credit. While this is not something that you can instantly fix, it is something worth working for. Improving credit by lowering debt and making payments on time helps to increase your credit worthiness. This is very important when it comes to banks and lending institutions in determining whether or not you are a good risk to take. 

But, how are interest rates set? For the most part, the determination of what the rates are has a lot to do with what the Federal Reserve says it should be. This determination is based on many things but one of the largest is the economy. Should the economy be doing well, interest rates tend to go up to help increase profitability and allow your savings dollar to do more. Likewise, when the economy is doing poorly, it is necessary for the interest rates to fall slightly to help encourage people to open new businesses and purchase more homes. This will then strengthen the economy in the long run. 

Being smart about interest rates is essential to living a profitable life.
