People throughout the country are struggling with how to handle the powerful emotions evoked by the scenes of destruction in the aftermath of the recent hurricanes. 

Silent Unity, one of the world's oldest and largest prayer ministries, began receiving prayer requests for people in the path of the hurricanes as soon as the news coverage mentioned the approaches of the huge storms.

Here is one such request, shared by Silent Unity with the writer's permission:

What can I do? I can't even find the right words to say in a prayer because so many lives have been lost and so many people are in need of help. It seems like any words I could pray are not enough to really help in such an overwhelming situation.

We understand your feelings. Many people are seeking reassurance and an affirmation that God is present in the situation, regardless of how dire it appears at the moment. We invite you to keep the faith for all those affected by the hurricanes by affirming the following:

* We affirm peace, protection, healing and divine order;

* the love of God comforts and soothes you;

* the light of God guides you and keeps you safe;

* the life of God heals and renews you;

* the power of God works through you to restore order and rebuild your life;

* you are sustained in body, mind and spirit by the ever-renewing presence of God.

Silent Unity has been praying with people of all faiths for more than 100 years. Its 300 employees respond to each request for prayer support with reverence and complete confidentiality.
