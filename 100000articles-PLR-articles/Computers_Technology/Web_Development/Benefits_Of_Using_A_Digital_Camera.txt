Digital cameras are electronic devices that capture as well as store images digitally, instead of on photographic films. A digital camera, however, needs a memory or a storage media to save these pictures. Some of the most popularly used storage devices include Floppy Disks, CD Singles, DVDs, Memory Cards (such as Microdrives or CompactFlash Cards, Memory Sticks, MiniSD Cards, MicroSD cards, etc), FP Memory and many others. Though storage devices such as Floppy Disks need computers, using autonomous devices, like the PictBridge Printer can ensure that you can print your pictures directly using a printer.

One of the greatest advantages of using a digital camera is that they, unlike the conventional cameras, can record, store, retrieve, remove, edit and manage your pictures as you may wish to. In fact digital cameras may also allow one to shoot and save videos of a considerable length. The sound and the picture quality ranges form one camera to another to a great extent, though in most cases a digital camera can surely allow you to shoot at least a reasonably good video.

Another great benefit of using a digital camera is that these devices are (in most of the cases) very portable, and can be easily carried around form place to place. Though one cannot say that these are not delicate, and need not be handled with care, one can sure stay assured of the fact that these days digital cameras are not very difficult to be taken care of either. If you can keep it safely in a cover, and handle it with reasonable care, and your camera is sure to serve you well. However, since in most cases digital cameras come with a long guarantee period, this is one thing you simply need not worry about!

Just like all other electronic devices, digital cameras also come with a wide rage of features that keep on adding and developing with the growth in technology. Though much depends on the price of the camera and the companies manufacturing it, there are certain features that have been found to be popular among almost all of them. These days it is not rare to find digital cameras allowing zoom, image adjusting, and automatic functioning (as based on the time set by you), when you go clicking pictures. Settings as to the picture color code, brightness, sharpness, etc can also be changed. Generally digital cameras also allow you to make your own picture or video albums, so that you can systematically save them all.

A digital camera works on battery, the life and the stand by time of which varies greatly, depending on the camera you are using and of course on the battery itself. Generally these are chargeable, so you know you can charge your battery anytime you need to. However, the best part of it is that, (depending on your video camera) the battery can work non-stop for a relatively fair amount of time. This means you can click away your pictures happily, without having to bother about the battery betraying you mid way!

These days almost all well known and even not so well known electronic device related company can be seen producing digital cameras. Needless to say, as more and more companies enter the market producing more and more sophisticated digital cameras, the more the prices can be seen falling with each passing day. Now in such circumstances, how can anyone resist having a digital camera of their own?!
