Another popular Latin American destination wedding location is Mexico.  This is a popular location for a couple of causes.

Guests who arrive early or choose to spend a few more days in Mexico will not be disappointed with the available activities.  Scuba diving, snorkeling, fishing, sunbathing and travel to ancient ruins are just a few of the activities that the guests can enjoy while in Mexico. 

A Latin American destination wedding is basically a wedding and vacation combination.  The key to hosting a dandy destination wedding is to pick out a location that will bring your guests with a beautiful background as well as a wealth of activities to keep them entertained for at least a few days.  Although a destination wedding may sound right, it is crucial to realize that there are a few downsides to hosting a destination wedding.  One problem is that numerous guests will decline your invitation because they are either unable or not going to travel for the wedding.  This can also work to your benefit by limiting the total of guests as well.  While you may be disappointed if close friends decline your wedding invitation, you are likely to be relieved that you do not have to pay for far off relatives or casual acquaintances at your wedding.  The benefit, however, to a destination wedding is that the couple does not have to travel for their honeymoon and that the guests have the luxury of spending a few day in an exotic location.
