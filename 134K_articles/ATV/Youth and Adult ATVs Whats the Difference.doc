}Youth and Adult ATV\u8217\'92s, What\u8217\'92s the Difference?\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 If you are
 considering buying an ATV for your child, chances are you have heard the advice
 to only let them ride a youth sized ATV. Is there a big difference between youth
 ATV\u8217\'92s and adult sized ATV\u8217\'92s? There is indeed and the differences
 are what will keep your kid safe or potentially cause them to get injured. You 
should only let your kid ride a youth sized ATV because they are smaller, lighter
, and easier for a child to handle. Adult ATV\u8217\'92s are dangerous for children
 and children should not be allowed to ride them until they are old enough and large
 enough to properly handle them.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 While size
 is the most obvious difference, there are other differences between youth and adult
 sized ATV\u8217\'92s. It is important for children to only ride youth sized ATV
\u8217\'92s because they can comfortable control them. A child or preteen will have
 to stretch to reach the handle bars of an adult sized ATV and will not be able 
to put their feet on the ground. It is important to be able to comfortably reach
 the handle bars and the ground for safety reasons. Most children under 16 are not
 big enough to comfortably ride an adult sized ATV.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Adult sized
 ATV\u8217\'92s are also heavier and more powerful than youth sized ATV\u8217\'92
s. They are designed for adults and children will have a hard time reaching the 
handle bars and pedals. This makes them harder to ride and they require more strength
 to control because of their larger size. Most children do not have the strength
 or experience to properly control these bigger machines. Adult ATV\u8217\'92s also
 go much faster than youth ATV\u8217\'92s which is not a good thing for inexperienced
 riders. Children should only be able to ride at a speed they can handle and on 
terrain they can comfortably maneuver.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Even if they
 have their own ATV, your child will probably want to ride yours because of the 
\u8220\'93cool\u8221\'94 factor. Make sure you explain to your child that adult 
ATV\u8217\'92s are dangerous for children and they need more experience and strength
 before they can ride one. Do not be tempted to give in, as it is easy for a child
 to loose control of a large ATV. The size and speed of an adult ATV makes them 
dangerous for children so make sure you wait until your child is old enough to let
 them ride one.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Youth ATV
\u8217\'92s also have safety features not found on adult ATV\u8217\'92s that will
 help to keep your child safe. These features allow parents to retain some control
 and keep their kids safe if they run into trouble or break the rules. You can get
 a youth ATV with a remote shutoff so that you can turn off their ATV if they run
 into trouble. Youth ATV\u8217\'92s usually have other features that make them safer
 to operate as well. They have larger brake pedals, larger mirrors, and handle bars
 that are sized for smaller hands. All these features make youth ATV\u8217\'92s 
safer for children and are reasons why children should only drive youth sized ATV
\u8217\'92s.\par}
