Are you familiar with the many types of MasterCard / Visa merchant account options that are available for small business owners? You may be eligible to apply for a merchant account from a bank or other lender who will underwrite your account services in order to help your company grow. The service works much like a personal credit card account. You apply, get approved, and start using it in a responsible manner. You might be able to work with a local banker or the institution with which you hold a personal credit card. Otherwise, you can apply with several merchant account vendors who are looking for serious entrepreneurs with whom to do business. To be eligible, your company should not have a poor credit history, you should not be carrying too much debt for your company size currently, and you should not be involved in an enterprise that creates doubt or suspicions for the underwriters. 

When your merchant account status is confirmed, you can soon enjoy the benefits of credit card processing that the MasterCard/Visa merchant account options provide. For one thing, you can buy a credit card processor for a few hundred dollars and start using it in your shop or store to let customers pay by credit card if they prefer. Instead of fumbling to make change or suspiciously eyeing a new-account check, you can blithely swipe a credit card from dozens of customers and keep the checkout line moving smoothly. Even if you deliver goods or services to customers all over the city or in a multi-county area, you can take along a wireless credit-processing unit for point-of-sale transactions, thereby eliminating billing worries for months to come. 

Another way that your MasterCard/Visa merchant account can serve your business is by providing a pager to help you keep in touch with clients or employees. Getting out of touch is a fast way to lose your customers’ business or to let employees turn careless. An exciting innovation in recent years is the telephone credit processing system that many companies are now using. Your customers are able to call a toll-free number, select options from a pre-recorded menu, and then key in a credit card number for payment. They can order and make payments in this manner either by day or night, since the system is operated and need not be restricted to access during business hours. A customer services representative can be available during selected hours to answer questions or provide assistance. 

The electronic age is here to stay, and entrepreneurs realize the importance of keeping up with e-commerce trends. Not only are their competitors doing so already, but customers are expecting to use these methods as well; in fact, some may demand them or take their business elsewhere. A merchant account can provide up-to-date, affordable services to upgrade the quality of your company’s operations. Don’t be left in the Dark Ages while everyone else is flourishing with innovative business technology. Find out how your company can grow with the help of a MasterCard/Visa merchant account.
