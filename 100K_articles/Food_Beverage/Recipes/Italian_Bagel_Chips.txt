Italian bagel chips takes plain bagels and making them into something special. Add some wonderful seasoning and what seemed old and boring before has a whole new lift to it. Use these chips with a variety of dips and you'll please even the pickiest of eaters.

<b>What you'll need:</b><br>
- 6 plain bagels (thinly sliced)<br>
- 4 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br>
- 1 glove garlic (minced)<br>
- 1 Tbsp minced fresh rosemary<br>
- 1/4 tsp sea salt<br>
- 1/4 tsp black pepper<br>
- 4 Tbsp freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese

First, preheat your oven to 325 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

Next place bagel slices in a single layer on the baking sheets. Make sure you don't double the slices up on the backing sheets, they won't bake properly. If needed, bake the bagel slices in batches.

In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper. With a pastry brush, brush the tops of the bagel slices and top with a little sprinkling of the cheese.

All that's left is to bake these yummy Italian bagel chips for 15 to 20 minutes or until they become crisp and turn a golden brown color and the cheese has melted. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. I like to cool them on cookie racks. You can serve them warm or make them ahead of time and store them in an airtight container.

This recipe makes 60 to 120 chips. Make more than you think you'll need as they disappear fast! 

A wonderful dip to try with these bagel chips is Gouda Cheese Onion Dip. You can find this recipe on my web site. Just check the information below.
