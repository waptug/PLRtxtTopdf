Managing a small business is rewarding, both personally and financially. However, it is also stressful and time consuming. By keeping in mind the following five tips, small business owners can better manage their business and feel less stressed. 

&#8226; Maintain a healthy work-life balance. If your business is run out of your home, try to set business hours that you work by, take breaks throughout the day or go out for lunch. Destress and recharge your batteries by developing interests or hobbies outside your business.

&#8226; Set goals. Setting short and long-term business goals can help you keep your business on track. They can also offer a sense of direction that helps to guide business growth. Whether it's opening another store or increasing profit, it doesn't hurt to "think big."

&#8226; Keep finances in order. Keeping track of money coming in and going out can easily get out of control using paper, spreadsheets and file folders. If this is your method, it's time to accurately track and keep your company finances organized throughout the year. This will also make tax time a whole lot easier. No matter if you have simple or complex accounting needs, with the help of financial software such as QuickBooks, you'll be able to easily and effectively manage your finances.

&#8226; Stay informed. With any business it's important to stay informed about the industry, business trends and current events. At the same time, you need to stay informed about specific laws, regulations and tax codes that affect your business. 

&#8226; Develop a network. Small business owners often don't have the support and resources that a large company can provide. Therefore, it's important to build a strong network of people-employees, vendors and other small business owners. 

For example, participating in local business organizations and conferences are good ways to find support and develop a professional network. This network will prove invaluable when you need inspiration or advice on how to better manage your business.

Managing a small business doesn't have to be a juggling act. Simple tips can make managing a small business a breeze.
