If you are looking for a way to earn extra income or even quit your job and work part-time to bring in a full-time income, the chances are that you've encountered any number of home-based business opportunities. Some home-based business opportunities fall into the category of traditional networking marketing, where you sign up with a company to sell products and the opportunity to your network of contacts. Typically, this involves house parties or a variation of house parties, and exhausting your friends, neighbors, and family members with requests to host parties or to give you the contact information of their friends and colleagues. 

Increasingly, however, home-based business opportunities are Internet-based. The lure is seductive, in that the idea of building a home-based business with a computer, keyboard, and mouse is extremely appealing. And there is definitely money to be made and many legitimate Web-based opportunities. How, though, do you separate the fly-by-night operations from those that are credible? In two words, it's marketing and advertising.

The ability to market and advertise a networking marketing plan is key to its growth and success. After all, there's an enormous amount of competition out there, and the company that has marketing and advertising expertise will always come out on top. So, when you're looking at home-based business opportunities, the first things to consider are who does the marketing and advertising, and who assumes the cost of marketing and advertising. 

When you think about it, it all comes down to synergy. In simple terms, it means that two or more entities come together, and that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. In the real world of home-based business opportunities, it means that two or three companies enter into an agreement and form a network marketing company. In the best possible scenario, each of the companies has a specialty. One company might specialize in, for example, wellness products, while another's expertise might be in helping people build businesses. The third company might be a marketing company that has knowledge and experience in Internet marketing. While each of the three companies has an area of expertise, together they can achieve much more than any of them could separately. 

Of the three companies, it can be argued that the marketing company plays the most pivotal role. And, increasingly, Internet marketing companies are partnering with product and business companies to profit from the network marketing opportunity. What does that mean if you're looking for a good home-based business? It means that you don't have to do the marketing and advertising yourself. That is a huge plus for any opportunity. After all, you're probably not a whiz at Internet marketing, so an opportunity that does the marketing and advertising for you will ultimately add to your bottom line. You don't have to spend a fortune in marketing costs, yet you reap the benefits from their efforts. 

Of course, the other two companies involved are also important. Again, if you're not experienced in setting up and running a business, having a company that specializes in helping people like you create their own businesses is invaluable. Likewise, a company with a desirable product and a sterling reputation will also help you succeed. But when you're begin reviewing home-based business opportunities, always look at the ways in which the company will promote the product and the opportunity. In doing so, you'll always come out ahead.
