Chateau Du Sureau

A fairy tale awaits you in Oakhurst, California, just minutes from Yosemite in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas at Chateau du Sureau.  Everything from the European style stucco building to the life-sized chess board will evoke a feeling of being transported to another place and time.
Wrought iron gates emblazoned with the Château's elegant crest open to reveal the stately 9000 square foot stucco Inn, complete with a stone turret, Parisian balconies and shuttered windows, all on nine acres of meticulously landscaped park grounds. 
Walking paths, fountains, a swimming pool, a bocce court and a life-size chess set add to the natural cachet and charm of the area. Once inside, guests are quickly enveloped in the Château's extraordinary European hospitality. It was Erna's desire to bring the traditions and hospitality of Europe's grand houses to the States and she has truly captured it here. Chambermaids, attired in black dress and white linen aprons, present baskets of refreshments and tea. There is no front desk, no check in, no credit card imprinting (only a hand written bill discreetly presented before guests leave) and no televisions in the guest's rooms. 
Each guest room is individually decorated and named for restorative herbs that can be found growing on the property.  Erma's Elderberry House, one of the finest restaurants, is located on the property for your dining pleasure.

The Chateau du Sureau offers a complimentary full breakfast to each guest and also provides coffee in each room.  Besides the ten rooms within the main building, there is also a two bedroom villa available for those who wish more privacy.  

The Chateau du Sureau offers exercise equipment, a pool, lawn games and several balconies for your enjoyment.  The facilities is totally non-smoking. With the peaceful surroundings available here, you may make this your only destination.
