Coffee drinkers have enjoyed smelling coffee's soothing aroma and drinking coffee as a morning treat for thousands of years. It's often used as a "pick-me-up" to get going in the mornings, as a warming drink during cold winter weather, and even as a treat after meals. In recent years, more and more coffee distributors have been exploring different flavors of coffee, trying out new ground coffees and coffee blends. If you're a coffee drinker, here are some ways to enjoy premium coffee to the fullest and its many benefits.

Premium coffee has been around for years, but not quite in the variety that it's available today. Now you can even go online to order almost any type of coffee beans you'd like. You can order world coffee from many different countries to try all the different coffee blends. You can order roasted coffee, strong coffee, or Kona coffee. There are so many types of coffee that the choices seem endless.

Cold and Flavored Coffee

Another enjoyable type of coffee that's popular today is a cold coffee or iced coffee beverage. There are a variety of cappuccinos, which are specially flavored blends of coffee, milk, and other ingredients to create a sweet coffee-like treat. Then, you can try an iced latte, espresso, and other premium coffee beverages as an alternative to milkshakes and other beverage treats. These even make a great treat for kids.... but don't allow them to drink too much coffee or they might bounce off the walls for a while!

Health Benefits of Coffee

There are conflicting beliefs about the health benefits of coffee, but like any other natural food or beverage, the issue is usually "how much" a person should eat or drink rather than "if" they should. Regular, moderate premium coffee consumption has been linked to many health benefits. Studies have shown that coffee drinkers are less susceptive to certain ailments such as Alzheimer's disease, gallstones, diabetes, depression, and Parkinson's disease. There are many natural antioxidants contained in ground coffee and coffee beans. Antioxidants aid in the removal of toxins in our bodies and help prevent disease. 

On the negative side, coffee also has extremely high caffeine content. Caffeine can provide a sudden boost of energy, but can also cause long-term health ailments if consumed too much, such as a heart rate increase, high blood pressure, or an irregular heartbeat. Coffee is also highly acidic, which can cause a decrease in oxygen levels in the body and a build up of lactic acid. Luckily for those who need to limit their caffeine intake, there is decaf coffee that has most of the caffeine removed.

So as with many natural foods and drinks, drinking coffee in moderation is still the best way to enjoy its health benefits and other benefits as well.
