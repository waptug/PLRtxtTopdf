Penny postcards became popular in 1890 to 1917. These postcards were called such because they were mailed with a one-penny postage stamp. Penny postcards became very popular during this period that printers, businesses and photographers were always trying to find new and exciting subjects to capture in order to satisfy customers that were hungry for new ideas and art work to impress their friends or lovers. 

During this era photo studios employ women to color the photo postcards. But today, women need not manually color these cards. Printing machines are available these days that can produce crisp, vibrant and colorful prints. Inkjet printers, for one, use digitally controlled pipelines that can deliver consistent output. In inkjet printing, small drops of ink are placed in the paper to create an image. There is no need for chemical reaction or light induced processes as the tint is directly deposited into the print. Out of the different types of printer available today, inkjet printers are the most popular. Today, the only technology that comes close to it is the laser printers. 

Inkjet photo printing has several benefits. It saves time, offers instant satisfaction and is breaking new ground in photo color consistency and quality. Additionally, you can easily adjust your own photos to achieve more vibrant pictures and avoid relying on the uncertainties of traditional photo printing. But when using inkjet printers, it is better to use inkjet photo papers as well. This is because using inkjet photo papers can provide brighter pictures, sharp line, long lasting output, good coverage and saturation and minimized banding.     

The drawback with inkjet printers is that although they are cheaper to buy than laser printers, they are generally more expensive to maintain. The cartridges need to be changed more often and the special paper required to produce high quality output is rather expensive. But as researches in inkjet technology has been continuously made, the price of inkjet printers have also continuously fallen. Another downside with inkjet technology is the tendency of the ink to smudge immediately after printing. But this problem has improved, too, during the past few years with the development of new ink compositions. 

Thus, when you want your postcards or any artwork to stand out, you can seek out real photographic artworks. And perhaps one of the best ways to create your vivid photos is by using inkjet technology. You can make an album of your photo postcards and your friends and guests can look through the album on their visits.
