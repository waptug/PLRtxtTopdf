<b>Free Online Guitar Lesson - How to Play The G Chord:</b>

<u>Step 1</u> - Look at your left hand and, ignoring your thumb,  number your other fingers 1, 2, 3, and 4, starting with your index finger and ending with your pinkie.

<u>Step 2</u> - In looking at a chord chart, you will see that your index finger (number 1) should be placed on the second fret on the fifth string.

<u>Step 3</u> - Next, your middle finger (number 2) is to be placed on the third fret of the sixth string.

<u>Step 4</u> - The ring finger (number 3) is to be placed on the third fret of the first string. Note: The first string is the highest pitched.

<u>Step 5</u> - Lastly, when all your fingers are correctly in place, strum the strings.  

As a beginner learning how to play guitar, you may notice that when you first learn to play guitar chords, that some of the strings sound dead. This is caused by several things, most commonly because you may not be pressing hard enough.

Futhermore, for proper chord playing, be sure that your fingers are placed squarely on each string and avoid touching the middle three strings with your fingers (they should be left open).  If you are touching the middle strings, you will deaden their sound. Also, be sure that you are pressing the strings between the little fret bars, and not right on top of them.

With continued practice, you'll soon be fingering the G chord like a professional guitarist!

Once you've mastered the G chord, you'll be ready to learn more guitar chords. You will find that there are hundreds of guitar chords that you can learn to play.  But for a beginner, you only need to learn a few chords to play your first song. The G, C, D, and E minor chords are some of the most useful chords to know when learning how to play guitar.

I hope you have found this <i>free online guitar lesson</i> teaching you how to play the G chord helpful.  Good Luck!
