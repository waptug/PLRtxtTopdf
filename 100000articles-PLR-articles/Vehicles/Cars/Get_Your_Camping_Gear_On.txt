    * Time of year.

These are basic simple things to think about.   Your camping equipment needs will vary depending on where you will be camping.  Camping on the beach has different needs then camping in the mountains.  You should always start your foray into camping small.  Take a day trip somewhere close to your home.  Check out the surroundings and the camp sites.  Get an understanding of what the equipment needs will be. 

Once you are comfortable on your day trips you can move to an overnight camping trip. This requires you to think harder about what your needs will be.  You must have food, shelter, and the equipment to cook and keep your food.  You need to be able to see at night and be able to start and sustain a fire.  You should think about what you will do in inclement weather.

The initial cost of acquiring all of your camping gear can be quite high.  Remember that and make your purchases over time.  Watch for sales for camping gear in the off season.  You can find great deals on your camping equipment this way.  You can also find great deals on the Internet.

Camping has a great sense of community and people often share their experiences and great places to camp.  You can find many such sites on the Internet where people share everything that is camping.  The most important thing about camping is to ensure that you are prepared.  There is no such thing as being over prepared.  

It would be a tough camping trip if you planned to go to the desert on a trek and forgot to bring water.  Camping is great fun for the whole family.  Remember; always be prepared when going on your next camping trip.
