Article Body:
The Scion brand is truly a marketing innovation come true for its umbrella company Toyota based out of Aichi, Japan. Their subsidiary brand has catered to a target market previously ignored by other car manufacturers; it has literally revolutionized the car industry with its new youth oriented Scion brand. The company's brand is both unique and exciting in two ways: it offers customization options not seen any where else and it has become a "magnet" for younger consumers. In fact, Toyota's Scion brand has the youngest audience of any automaker: the average age of its driver is only 31.

The company's Scion website is a marketing feat in and of itself. Dozens of modified Scion TC photo shots enthrall the organization's flashy website. Scion also seems to make great use of their site by showing their cars "tricked out" and not just stock in order to give potential customers the ability to envision what a Scion could like after customization. From larger rims and wheels, to colorful paint jobs and body kits, they literally have an endless portrayal of customization possibilities for their Scion vehicles. What’s even more interesting is that Scion even owns a separate Scion parts website dedicated just to aftermarket parts ranging from body kits to performance parts. Very few car manufacturers have catered exclusively to aftermarket car tuners like Scion has, and the company has surely reaped many rewards as a result.

Scion's lead selling car, the Scion TC, portrays exactly what youth buyers are looking for; this entails an affordable vehicle that offers value, styling, and "after market" customization options that are available from the dealer. One of the vehicle's coolest standard features, however, is the panorama moonroof. This option offers great interior appeal, and is a standard feature not found on many vehicles under the base MSRP of $25,000. In addition, the vehicle also sports stylish alloy. Buyers can add on numerous options straight from the dealer such as:

    * neon underglow lights
    * Scion TC body kits
    * superchargers
    * door sills
    * carbon fiber b pillars
    * & more (all from the dealer).

While this is a very fast growing brand, Toyota is not looking for there Scion brand to gain mass appeal. Marketing managers state that the company will continue to innovate and focus on continuing to satisfy the demands and needs of younger auto consumers. They plan on continuing to fulfill the needs of the youth target market and simultaneously improve their product line by adding new standard features, improvements, and optional upgrades over time. Scion is also planning to continue expanding their product line with newer vehicles such as the recently released XD. I'm assuming that all of there new products will continue to build upon the past success of their flagship TC, while simultaneously offering new options, creative and innovative body styling, and countless aesthetic upgrades.
