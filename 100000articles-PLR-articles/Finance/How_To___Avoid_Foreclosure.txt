If you can not make the payments and you cannot find a way to get around it, letting it go will ruin your credit, but until it is over it can’t get any better. While this is not news you want to hear, it can be helpful to some. 

But, when you do have a shot, you need to take it. To avoid foreclosure, you need many options. For example, you may want to actually call the bank and ask them if there is a way you can work with them to end the problems. Maybe they can extend your payments so that you can get back up. 

You may be able to get a loan that will cover the amount that you owe as well as any other money that you need. This can then be paid off in installments. Although hard to find, this is one method to avoid foreclosure. 

You should take the time to speak with the creditors that you owe money to and see if you can work something out with them. Be honest and tell them what has happened, what you plan to do to get out of it, and see if they can help you. If it does come down to selling the house, do your best to get through it before it is too late. You can avoid foreclosure by taking the time to find all the options that you have and then choosing the best possible answer for you.
