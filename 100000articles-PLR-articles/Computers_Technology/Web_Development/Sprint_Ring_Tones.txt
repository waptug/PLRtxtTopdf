Cell phones are a big part of modern lifestyles.  They allow us to communicate, let us check our email, and even take pictures.  By customizing your Sprint phone with a personalized ring tone, you can easily distinguish your phone from a roomful of other handsets that may also be ringing.  Log onto the Internet and you can choose from a big selection of free ring tones.  Sounds easy, but it may actually be a little more complicated than that. 

Whether or not you can download free ring tones depends upon which Sprint cell phone you have.  Not all ring tones are adaptable to all Sprint phones; so don't bother downloading the ring tones if you're not able to use them.  Most Sprint phones will accept downloadable ring tones send by SMS.  In fact, Sprint was the first company to have access to the SMS format.  These days, however, there are other places to find free Sprint ring tones.

If you're not sure whether or not the ring tone you want will work on your phone, the best thing to do is go ahead and download it, then try to see if it works.  
Go online to browse for free downloadable ring tones, and you'll find lots to choose from.  

It seems that every month, a new cell phone is released on the market.  With each new phone come start-of-the-art technological advances, so the ring tones that worked on your last Sprint cell phone may not necessarily work on your new model.  All cell phones, particularly brand new releases, are programmed differently.

When you have a failed download, all may not be lost.  It could be a problem that can be resolved with a call to your service provider.  Or, look for the same song in a format that's adaptable to your phone.  There are countless websites offering downloadable ring tones that may be adaptable to your Sprint phone.  Some of these downloads are free, while others can cost up to $2 each, so you might want to think twice before going on a frenzy and downloading dozens of them.  If you simply can't find the ring tone you want to suit your phone, you'll just have to forget that tune and try to find another one.  

If personalizing your phone with your favorite song is important to you, make sure you check the compatibility of your Sprint phone before you buy.  You're able to compare all of the features, including download compatibility, with information available through retail locations or online. 

Despite the ever-changing technology and a market flooded with options, cell phones can tend to be fairly dull and predictable.  Sprint ring tones can bring life to your phone, and create a truly personalized accessory that really helps you stand out in a crowd.
