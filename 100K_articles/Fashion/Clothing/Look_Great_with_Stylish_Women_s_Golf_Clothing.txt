Article Body:
Whether you're on the fairway or in the clubhouse, it's important to look your best. Today's women's golf clothing offers an incredible variety of fashion choices designed to allow you to play in comfort and style - both on and off the course. 

Women's golf apparel has come a long way in the past few years, and is available in an unprecedented number of styles and sizes - including, thankfully, plus-size golf clothing. Here's an overview of this season's offerings:

Bette & Court

Bette & Court offers four collections: Samba, Sundance, Zanzibar, and Swing. Their women's golf clothing includes sleeveless and short-sleeved tops with zip collars and contrasting trim that feature moisture-wicking fabric, and capris in knit, microfiber, and moisture-wicking fabrications. Argyle V-neck sweaters and plaid capris offer a fashionable alternative to solids and block colors. 

EP Pro

EP Pro takes women's golf clothing to the next level with color and prints in seven collections: Finding Nemo, Kapalua, Safari, Sandcastle, Sawgrass, Zanzibar, Potpourri, and Urban Jungle. Floral print golf skorts and poplin plaid skorts are just the beginning of the fashion story, with argyle sleeveless shells, cuffed pedal pushers, and coordinating quilted bags rounding out the tale. 

Fairway & Greene

Fairway & Greene kick the basics up a notch with their Fun in the Sun, Spring Fling, Maple Ridge, and Northern Lights collections. Sleeveless, cap sleeves, short sleeves, and 3/4 sleeves give women the choices they want, while windsweaters and microfleece vests provide warmth even when your best shots leave you out in the cold. 

Sport Haley

Sport Haley keeps it elemental - as in their Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water collections. Their Aerocool polo shirts incorporate spandex for maximum comfort, while their webbing belts provide just the right accessorizing touch. Sport Haley's Aerogreen Italian women's golf shoes are classics - durable, comfortable, and timeless. 

Tehama

With eight collections, Tehama offers unprecedented choices. Flaming Star, Desert Trail, Lunch at the Club, Picnic by the Lake, Team Match, Snowy River, Blind Date, and Dances with Wolves provide everything from simple polos to striped capris. What sets Tehama apart is their après-golf apparel, which includes a stunning embellished sweater cardigan. 

Shopping for Women's Golf Clothing

While shopping for women's golf clothing in retail shops can be fun, the selection is all too often limited. Online sources of women's golf apparel can do what country clubs can't - carry a wide variety of styles and sizes from the top brand names. Those that specialize in women's apparel only have their fingers on the pulse of the fashion world, and can offer you the choices you want and need.
