Article Body:
Engineering can be defined as the implication of science to meet the demands of humanity. This is executed through the implication of knowledge in regards to mathematics, physics and practical experience to the blue print of useful processes and objects. The professionals of this execution are known as engineers.

Just as music can be sub-grouped into various areas like Western, Country, rap and classic, the different types of engineering can also be sub-grouped as below. Before choosing the engineering specialty of your choosing be sure to research it well. Get a hold of some that already completed their courses and are working in the field, find out their recommendations, tips and warnings. A little research will go a really long way when you consider the many years of commitment you’re considering with a degree in engineering. 

1. Aerospace Engineering - Aerospace Engineering concentrates on the research and design of spacecraft, aircraft, missiles, and related components. Aerospace engineers design, model, analyze, simulate, and test spacecraft and aircraft as well as their associated components.

2. Bioengineering - Bioengineering combines medical and biological sciences to get a detailed understanding of the biological phenomena. Bioengineers may work with medical practitioners to develop new, medical devices and techniques. They can also work as clinical engineers. 

3. Agricultural Engineering -This combines the physical and biological sciences. Agricultural Engineers have options such as agriculture, food systems, biological system and environmental science. They are involved with food and bioprocess engineering as well as bioenvironmental engineering of plant and animal facilities and water quality. 

4. Chemical Engineering -This combines the study of chemistry with the laws of engineering, computer science and physics to solve problems. For example, they use natural resources and convert them to corn syrup or computer chips.

5. Civil Engineering Degree - A civil engineering degree online embodies the planning, design, and construction of objects that facilitate life. They are responsible for building bridges, highways, buildings, dams, irrigation systems, etc. 

6. Electrical Engineering - Electrical engineering embodies the aspects of biology, physics, medicine, and computer science. They work with electricity and electromagnetic fields used in communication and electronic circuits. 

7. Computer Engineering - Computer engineering integrates the design and analysis of computers and the services like computer networks. They also help in designing of intelligence system like robots. 

8. Mechanical Engineering Degree - This applies mathematics and science related courses to design machines and components. A person who attains their mechanical engineering degree online will work for the better efficiency of machinery. 

9. Nuclear Engineering - This involves the development and use of solar and nuclear energy for energy production and various uses. They study nuclear power and innovate better ways of security and standard of life with less hazards.

Other types of engineering include Software Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering, Radiological Engineering, Bimolecular Engineering, etc., which involve working for the betterment of our society. 

These days you can even visit an engineering college offering an engineering degree online but you should be very careful and check out the authenticity before committing your hard earned cash to any of them.
