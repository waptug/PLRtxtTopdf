Article Body:
Blokus Trigon is an abstract strategy game from the makers of Blokus. The board pieces have changed from square to triagonal. Game play is similar to Blokus, as players try to get rid of all their pieces. The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one of your pieces already on the board at a corner.
There is a solitaire version where one player tries to get rid of all the pieces in a single sitting.http://astore.amazon.com/blokus-trigon06-20
