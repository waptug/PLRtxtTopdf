No matter how much experience or effort you put into fixing your registry you might still have a few uncorrectable errors left. Based on my experiences, as time goes by you’re going to eventually install new programs and hardware into your computer, and you’ll also be uninstalling them so you run the risk carrying unwanted and invalid registry entries; this will prevent your computer from operating smoothly.
