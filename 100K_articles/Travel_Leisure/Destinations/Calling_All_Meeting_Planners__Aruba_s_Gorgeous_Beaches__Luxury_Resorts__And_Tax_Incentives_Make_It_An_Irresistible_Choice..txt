Aruba is more than just picture perfect beaches, beautiful weather and an oasis of relaxation. It’s now one of the best places in the world to hold a business meeting, convention or other corporate function. Why? The U.S. Treasury Department announced that the United States and Aruba signed the Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) between the two countries. How would this be of interest to event and meeting planners? Because conducting meetings on Aruba will now be exactly like having meetings in the United States, in terms of tax benefits. That’s right; U.S. taxpayers can claim tax deductions for all expenses associated with meetings, seminars and conventions held in Aruba. As a result, Aruba now becomes the ninth significant offshore financial center to sign such an agreement with the United States.

So, why did this agreement happen in the first place? Well, besides the economic benefit that Aruba will no doubt enjoy from the increased business, there are a few other good reasons:

• It’s an example of goodwill between the U.S. and Aruba

• Helps to ensure that no safe haven exists for funds associated with illicit activities, including terrorism, money laundering and tax evasion.

• Serves as a pledge to maintain the confidence of honest taxpayers, and the fairness of the tax systems in the two countries’ dealings.

“Aruba is extremely optimistic about the Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the United States and the fact that for tax purposes, having a meeting in Aruba is now just as easy as one in United States,” said Minister of Tourism and Transportation Edison Briesen. “We hope that the TIEA and the availability of brand-new tax incentives for the group and meetings/incentives markets will make Aruba even more of a desirable destination.”
