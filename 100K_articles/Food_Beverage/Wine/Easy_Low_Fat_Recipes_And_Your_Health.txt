For the person who’s constantly going back and forth between one diet or another, there never seems to be much fun in their lives. I should know as I’ve been yo-yo dieting for most of my adult life now. I would go from one diet plan to another and stick with it only long enough for it to work a little. At which point I’d get tired of it and go back to my rounds of binge-eating. Naturally this wasn’t healthy, and only by a great effort on my part have I now decided to turn my whole life around. Instead of alternately bingeing and dieting I’ve now decided to go the healthy route and am now going in for sensible eating ideas and regular exercise. I’ve also resorted to using a few really tasty low fat recipes to help me in my new get-fit regime.

I decided to try out some easy low fat recipes because when I first started on my sensible eating plan, I found there weren’t really too many things that I could eat that were also good for me and tasty. I had always scorned any low fat foods and meals since they didn’t seem to taste very good, but since then I’ve learned a lot, and have found great ways to make easy low fat recipes that tickle my taste buds. 

A few years ago sadly enough this wasn’t the case and it was really difficult to get any really good tasting low fat recipes that could satisfy your hunger at the same time as well. Or at least that was my perception at the time. Luckily I found out that I was wrong and that if you prepare your meals with care using some easy low fat recipes you could turn out a dish to rival any of the ones swimming in fats. 

Eating low fat meals is just another sensible way to contain your excess food and fat intake. Having easy low fat recipes on hand however, just makes it all the more easier for you to stick your new plan. Think about it, if you have to slave over the stove for a long time only to produce something that’s only slightly edible, and has no compensation of fats in it either would you really do it? I didn’t think so. Everyone needs motivation to do something and using easy low fat recipes is one the best ways that I’ve found to stay on my sensible eating regime. 

These recipes need not be hard to remember, and they don’t need to utilize a lot of ingredients either. So you can either have them handy on a few card sheets, or you could just stick them up on the refrigerator for them to be in plain sight always. Whatever you decide though, I’ve found that easy low fat recipes are my ticket to getting my life back into order, and my weight back into a good balance.
