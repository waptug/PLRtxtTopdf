Article Body:
The business world is changing, and we are seeing the rapid rise of people who are wanting to work at home. Some companies are looking to make their employees sub-contractors because they want to pay less benefits. The economy and natural disasters have affected others. As a result, more and more people are looking to start a home business of their own. 

There probably never has been a greater opportunity to start a home business opportunity than now. With the internet giving access to the world, the possibilities are nearly endless. A store-front is no longer needed, unless you are dealing with a large quantity of product. And because it is in your home, thousands of dollars can be saved each year. 

Every business will provide one of two different things to the potential customer. It will be either a product, or a service. But either one must have advertising in order for the customer to know about what you offer. Your work at home business opportunity will succeed or fail based on this one factor. This article will seek to provide some quick ideas about how to advertise your business by using the internet.

Google Adwords

This is probably one of your best promotional tools for every dollar that is spent. This will require some study in selecting the right keywords to use in the google program. There is a cost per click - every time someone clicks on your ad, you pay a few cents, which is predetermined by you. Although effective, it will take a lot of watching to be able to get it right, and to keep it there.

Submit To Search Engines

Various websites will submit your website information, with your keywords, to multiple search engines. Some sites will submit your information to over 75 search engines - for free. For a rather small fee, this number can be multiplied many times.  These will get the word out to the most popular engines, including google and yahoo. A number of search engines will take more than three weeks to list your site. 

Create A Newsletter

This one will allow you to "get your list" of potential customers. Before you send out any illegal spam, however, it is important to get their approval for you to send them something. This is one way to be able to weekly email your customers - and in most cases, you can do it for free.

Write Free Articles

Write an article on your niche subject (the theme of your web page), and submit it to websites that distribute free web content. If written well, these will be picked up by other marketers and displayed on their site. Of course, you require that your name and website address must remain attached at the bottom. This is free advertising, and it is possible to be posted around the internet.

If you look around the internet, there are many other ways to get the word out about your business. Add some new ones regularly and see what gets the best results.
