No Deposit Poker – A Boon For Online Poker Players


Traditionally, Poker has been one of the most popular gambling games that has not only survived, but also adapted to the technological era. Contrary to the widely held fears, poker has flourished in the Internet era with online poker rooms devising new strategies to lure the players who like to try out the new medium. No deposit poker has replaced the marketing strategy of free lunches and snacks offered by the offline poker rooms. And the players are hooked on to their seats trying to get the maximum out of their free poker money.

Here is a quick lowdown on everything you need to know to get started with the no deposit poker online.

First of all, you need to lay your hands on a list of some reliable online poker rooms. This is the most vital part, as reliability is extremely crucial for any website that deals with online payments. A good starting point can be found here.

After settling for your choice of online poker room, it’s time to sign up. Once you are assured of the genuineness of the poker room, you can confidently share your personal information on the sign-up page.

Most reputed poker rooms will give you variable sign-up bonus to kick-start the action. This is the best part of playing online poker, since you start playing in no time without any initial deposit. You can actually test the website’s functionality and overall suitability to your tastes and preferences without any commitment. Both the players and the online poker rooms stand to gain from this no deposit poker strategy. Players obviously like free games and a chance to win money without any risk. And the online poker rooms stand a great chance to make a permanent customer who’ll come again and again, if he likes what he experiences. However, before you are allowed to withdraw any money from your account, you are required to play certain number of raked hands.

Besides the no deposit poker offers, free poker money can also be yours, either in the form of Standard Deposit Bonus or Free Money Bonus. 

The Standard Deposit Bonus is a percentage of the initial deposit amount subject to a maximum limit. For instance, it could be 50% or 100% or 200% bonus, implying, if you deposit $100, you get $200 in your account with a 100% bonus, and so on. Usually, the amount of Standard Deposit Bonus is deposited only when you start playing and meet certain other prerequisites. Also, the bonus amount is released in increments of $5 or $10 with a limited time period to redeem your bonus money.

The Free Money Bonus also referred to as Instant Bonus does not depend on any prerequisite to be satisfied and is automatically added to your account after you make an initial deposit. You are also free to withdraw this amount anytime without any pre-conditions.

Lastly, you must be over 18 years of age to open and confirm an account on an online poker room. The US citizens should also check out their legal position vis-à-vis the recent legislation, Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006.
