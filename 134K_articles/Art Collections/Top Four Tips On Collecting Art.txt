Top Four Tips On Collecting Art

Art collection can be a favourable hobby, past-time,
or even investment. If you are new to this kind of
activity, you can be overwhelmed with the vast number
of approaches that you can choose from. So, to make
things easier for you, here are some of the best tips
you can get in regards to collecting art.

Buy Because Of What?

First off, you should understand that you should buy
an artwork because you like it. Yes, it’s just that
simple. Although it may be common sense, a lot of
people still overlook this important idea. Some buy
pieces because other people told them so, or because
they saw others buying something similar. If you find
a piece that moves you, and you think can enhance your
life, then buy it! You do not have to wait for the
approval of others to do so since the whole decision
is yours.

What use is the beauty of an artwork that you bought,
if personally, you don’t appreciate it or find it
disgusting, even? Remember, in collecting art, there
is nothing more self-gratifying than seeing a piece
that communicates with you and moves your soul, most
especially if it’s a piece that remains fresh and
exciting for you even though you’ve seen it for
hundreds of times. Go Gallery Hopping!

Another good thing to do when you’re starting a
collection is to go gallery hopping. Try to go to as
many art galleries that you can visit. Galleries’
staff guides can be helpful to you and can add up to
your art education. Going to galleries can also be one
good way of being exposed to different kinds of art,
whether it is a gallery on paintings, sculptures or
prints.

Galleries provide you with the real thing. Thus, you
can examine more of the details of different works of
art. Most of the time, galleries showcase some
prestigious collections too. Viewing such, can yet be
another way of seeing the collections of other people
and generating ideas for your own collection. Get
Connected

Most galleries also have a mailing list that regularly
update you on their latest happenings and events.
Being connected and up to date with what’s happening
is another way to help you start with your collection.
Sometimes, if there are openings or special events
that these galleries hold, they can invite you to go.

Once you are invited, try your best to attend such
events so that you can be more exposed to the
industry. Additionally, events like these can bring
you opportunity to know more people within the
industry, and find more good deals around.

Go Local

If there are not much of art galleries in your place,
then you can still go local! Try visiting and joining
local art museums or non-profit art centers. You may
be surprised to see how local talents in your area
create masterpieces that seem priceless, yet you can
buy at a cheap price. Since probably most of them are
still budding artists, then you’ll probably spot some
good deals around in which the beauty of the piece
remains unaltered.

Also, the curators of such places sometimes provide
lectures for those who are interested in collecting
art. Some lectures may have a very cheap fee, while
some can come for free, especially if there are big
companies sponsoring the event.
