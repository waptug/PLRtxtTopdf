<b><u>HOW ADSENSE WORKS.</b></u>

Before you can understand why Google AdSense is so important to content sites, it’s important to know how AdSense works. The concept is really simple. The publisher or the webmaster needs to inserts a java script into his webpage. Each time the page is accessed, the java script will pull advertisements from the Google server. The ads that are targeted should therefore be related to the content that is contained on the web page serving the ad. If a visitor clicks on an advertisement, the webmaster serving the ad earns a portion of the money that the advertiser is paying the Google for the click. The Google handles all the tracking and payments, providing an easy way for webmasters to display content-sensitive ads without the hassle of soliciting advertisers, collect funds, and monitor the clicks and statistics.
