Article Body:
You've had a fire.  The fire department has come, put the fire out and all you see is one big mess. Upon closer investigation questions come. 

I. What method do we use to remove the soot and charcoal to evaluate the damage?

- High pressure water blasting leaves behind water in electrical components, equipment and insulation, if not properly removed will cause unwanted corrosion and rot, increasing cleanup, damage and long term maintenance costs.

- Soda blasting leaves water and soda behind, which requires additional cleanup, increasing cleanup, damage and long term maintenance costs.

- Sand blasting leaves abrasive blast media behind, which if not cleaned up properly continues to cause damage in electrical components, gears and bearings.  It continues to fall from horizontal surfaces, cracks and beams years after the job is done, increasing cleanup, damage and long term 
maintenance costs.

- Dry ice blasting is the ultimate surface cleaning process, it leaves no secondary waste stream behind.  The only cleanup after the dry ice blasting job is done is the removal of the debris caused by the fire.

II. How do we remove the soot, charcoal and smoke film from masonry and steel surfaces?

- Again this is an excellent application for dry ice blasting. Watch the movie clips on our web site  to see how dry ice blasting cleans soot, smoke and charcoal from different types of surfaces.

III. Will we be able to remove that awful smoke smell?

- The removing of the smell is accomplished by removing the smell source and/or sealing the smell source to encapsulate it. Dry ice blasting removes the soot, charcoal and smoke film, which is the smell source, from accessible areas.  

- During a fire air currents carry smoke and soot into cracks, openings and areas not in close proximity to the fire itself, additional cleaning and/or sealing of these places and inaccessible areas may be needed.

IV. Can we accomplish our cleanup without adding hazards to our environment?

- Dry ice blasting is safe and environmentally friendly. Dry ice is pure CO2 in its solid state, it is in its gaseous state in the air around us. When we inhale our bodies use the oxygen and we exhale CO2. Green plants take CO2 from the air and give off oxygen.

- Dry ice blasting is non-toxic, non-conductive and there is no employee exposure to hazardous cleaning chemicals or solutions. Dry ice blasting meets the guidelines of the USDA, EPA, and the FDA.
