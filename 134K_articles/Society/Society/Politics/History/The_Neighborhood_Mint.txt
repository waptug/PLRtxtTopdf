Article Body:
After a recent trip to Dahlonega, Georgia, I'm became obsessed with wanting to know more about the U.S. Mint that had been there and its history. To say that "The Neighborhood Mint: Dahlonega in the Age of Jackson" by Sylvia Head, Elizabeth W. Etheridge, gave me all the information I ever wanted to know would be an understatement. Their 200-page book is packed with facts, figures, stories, and bits of history that sometimes were overwhelming. At times you get the feeling the authors are "beating a dead horse", but I was never left with mysteries or unanswered questions.

Being a student of US coins, I was fascinated as to the role politics played in the coinage of our money, establishment of mints, and whom the mints employed. The authors drill down deep into the personalities and motives of the individual players. Additionally, I was fascinated to learn that Dahlonega was the site of the first American gold rush, not California. The Dahlonega mint never did produce the coinage anticipated by its developers for numerous reasons, which is also explained. I wouldn't recommend this book to the fainthearted. If you are history buff, coin collector, or a student of politics, this is a good read. If you are not, stay away.
