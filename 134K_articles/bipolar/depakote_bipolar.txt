Pharmacology

Depakote or valproic acid increases the brain concentration of GABA or gamma aminobutyric acid thereby acting as an anticonvulsant. But its action mechanism is not yet established and the effect is also unknown with regards to the neuronal membrane.

Depakote is administered orally and is rapidly absorbed. A single dose can give peak levels of serum after four hours, and its half-life ranges from 6-16 hours. Patients taking antiepileptic drugs together with Depakote will have a lower serum half-life.

If Depakote is administered amid meals, a minor delay can occur in the absorption of the valproic acid, and is quickly distributed in the body since it is bound strongly to plasma proteins. Protein binding may be decreased by increasing the dose. If Depakote needs to be used as a therapeutic drug, the concentration must only be about 50-100 mcg per ml. At present, good correlation between serum levels, therapeutic effect, and daily dose, is yet to be established.

The therapy must be instituted at periodic intervals at first because there have been reports about platelet aggregation and thrombocytopenia inhibition. The bleeding time and platelet counts should also be determined. 

When your doctor prescribes Depakote, you must follow all instructions pertaining to dosage and administration carefully. This is essential to avoid over dosage. Some patients ended in coma with the improper use of valproic acid. Since valproic acid is rapidly absorbed, there may be limited value of gastric lavage. Supportive measure must be applied to prevent hypovolemia and make sure that your urinary output is maintained.

Bipolar disorder requires medication as part of the treatment. Valproic acid is one of the many medications approved for bipolar disorder. With the right dosage, this can reduce bipolar symptoms, prevent episodes from occurring, shorten hospitalizations, and help the individual in living a productive life despite his condition.

Over time, bipolar disorder exposes people to mood changes which can reach the point of unacceptability in the society. But with proper treatment and medication, bipolar patients can lead rewarding lives.
