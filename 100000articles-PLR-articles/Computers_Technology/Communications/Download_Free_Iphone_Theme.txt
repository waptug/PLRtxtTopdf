Your Iphone is one of the most advanced media devices the world has yet seen, with the ability to watch movies, listen to music, surf the web and of course make phone calls, it seems like Apple's research and design department put in some overtime on this one.

Even if you aren't an Apple or iPod fan, the Iphone is very hard not to like. Why wouldn't anyone want to have their entire music collection and full internet access on their cellphone? Sadly though, stocks of the Iphone are low due to the sheer popularity of it, so it means many of us will have to wait a while before we can own one. All is not lost though, as you are still able to download Iphone themes for your average Nokia and Motorola phones.

If you are lucky enough to obtain an Iphone, you can download something known as a “hack toolkit” which allows you to get into the firmware etc of the Iphone, and change it's theme around etc. You'll find that the themes are available at many different places around the net.

When you are looking for places to download themes from, the biggest problem is finding a site you can trust. While it can be dangerous to your computer and your Iphone, due to the nature of the files downloading a theme is generally much safer than downloading a new game or movie etc, especially if you are using a shady P2P site, as P2P sites are known for their lack of safety for users.

Having said that, it's very important to be careful and keep your antivirus updated, as shady hackers and users of torrent sites can use fake downloads as a way to make you download trojan software or other things that will open the backdoor of your computer system. This can cause endless problems, it can even ill your computer so it's really worth making sure your antivirus software can keep you safe.
