Summer Learning

Summer time is a break for children from lessons, homework and the everyday structure 
that school provides.  But if you let the children stray too much from this routine during 
their summer break it can make the transition to school harder in the fall.

You do not have to make the children sit down every day to learn a lesson but you can 
include summertime activities that are fun and are centered on learning.  You can 
purchase workbooks for children that are meant to be preparatory for the next grade level 
at school and they are a great stepping stone.  But you can have a conversation with the 
child’s teacher at the end of the school year to determine what they need to work on and 
choose some activities that will help develop those skills.

For young children entering kindergarten count and name everything around you.  Read 
and spell out street signs to help with letter recognition.  Independence is the most 
important skill you can teach children entering school for the first time.  Encourage them 
to clean up after themselves and put on their own coat and shoes just like they will at 
school.

For older children, use little chores or errands and learning tools.  Have your child write 
down your grocery list as you go through the cupboards.  Have them pay for things with 
their own money or figure out how much money they need to save for a special item.

School is a big part of a child’s life and you want them to be successful.  Remember that 
taking a break is part of that so don’t overwhelm them with learning in the summer.  But 
don’t let them forget the important skills that they worked hard to learn the year before.  
Continued reading through the summer is the best preparation.
