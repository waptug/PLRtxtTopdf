<b>Whether it's the beginning of a new year or we're half way through,</b> you want it to be your best year ever. You are no doubt doing some planning for how to make that happen. You are doing some planning aren't you?

<b>I'd like to recommend you take some time to really clarify your Purpose and Vision.</b>

<b>Clear purpose and vision are the keys to giving you a focus and direction.</b> Unfortunately, that's something that is all too often lacking from small businesses. What you need to do is quite simple, but may challenge you if you've never taken the step before.

<b>Here are a few ideas to help you make this your best year ever.</b>

<b>A clear purpose describes what you are out to cause with your business.</b> Have you lost track of your purpose? Do you remember what led you to start or get into your business in the first place?

<b>* Three questions to ponder as you seek to re-ignite the purpose in your business:</b>

<blockquote>What do you really want out of life?

What do you really not want in your life?

What would you be willing to give up in order to live the life you want?</blockquote>

<b>Answer these questions honestly and build your business around the life you want to live.</b> Talk about a purpose that would set you on fire.

<b>* Here's an idea for creating your vision.</b> Think of the absolute greatest outcome that you can possible imagine that your best clients would really want from your service. Build your vision around being "the resource" that works to deliver that.

<b>* Examine your values and principles and then determine what you want your business to be in the future.</b> Find your favorite way to relax quietly and let your mind open to dwell in what's possible.

<b>* Imagine yourself in a private movie theater watching a movie of your future self in 10 years.</b> As the movie ends you notice you've been joined by the star of the show. Ask them any question you want about how they got to that place of great success in the movie. What was your future self's purpose and vision.

<b>This may seem silly to you at first,</b> but if you open your mind up to accept that the visioning process will work, you'll be amazed at the answers that will emerge.
