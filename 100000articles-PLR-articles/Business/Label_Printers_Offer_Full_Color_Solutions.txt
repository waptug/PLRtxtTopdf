Labels do not have to black and white bores.  In fact, label printers can produce amazing color labels that can increase consumer attention and sales.  Some industry pros maintain that a color label is about fifty percent more effective than a black and white option with respect to attracting a consumer‘s eye.  Anyone using labels on a retail product should certainly consider using the full color solutions offered by label printers.

Full color labels are often referred to a “four color” products because of the methods used in their creation.  Label printers use various screens and filters to parse an image into four separate colors (black, yellow, magenta and cyan).  After separation, each color element is put on a separate printing plate.  The press uses all of the plates to recreate the full color original.

Label printers can produce dazzling results in full color, but there is a downside.  Full color labels are more labor-intensive and expensive to produce.  The multiple plates, set-up costs and other expenses make full color options a more costly alternative to other options.  However, when one approaches their label purchase as an investment, instead of as a mere expense, the increased costs is often worthwhile.  Additionally, the high level of competition among label printers can often produce bargains that make the cost easier for the consumer to tolerate.

If you are looking for a way to distinguish your product and to give it a heightened level of “shelf appeal,” you may want to consider discussing full color labels with a few label printers.  Label printers can allow one to escape the drudgery and ineffectiveness of black and white offerings with exciting full color solutions that look marvelous and perform effectively.
