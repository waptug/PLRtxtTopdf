Article Body:
Although you may not have heard of this type of auction before, GSA auctions have been around for a while and are a good place to get a great deal on a vehicle.

GSA stands for General Service Administration. 

It is an agency in the US government that, according to acting Director David Bibbs, "is to help other US agencies better serve the public by meeting … their needs for products and services, and, to (help) simplify access to government information and services."

One of the services they provide are auto auctions.

So why does GSA sell vehicles? 

GSA purchases vehicles "in bulk", i.e., it purchases "bunches" of vehicles at once and then leases them out to different government agencies. When the lease expires, these vehicles are sold to the general public at GSA auctions, which allows the GSA to re-coup some of their  expenses and re-invest in more vehicle purchases. 

Benefits of purchasing a vehicle at a GSA auction:

1.)	American made vehicles - trucks, cars, SUV, police car, buses and many other types (approximately 40,000 vehicles to choose from per year)

2.)	Vehicles are generally well maintained (by the US Gov't). These are not specialized vehicles or repossessed.

3.)	Vehicles generally have low mileage

4.)	Vehicles are generally 3 to 5 years old

5.)	Vehicles generally sell at or around wholesale prices with no extra buyer fees.

All in all, if you are in the market for a great used vehicle at a great price, check out GSA public auctions.
