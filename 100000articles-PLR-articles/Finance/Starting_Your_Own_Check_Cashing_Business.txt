If you are currently thinking about starting your own check cashing business, there are things that you first need to consider. The path leading from conceptualization to realization can be a scary and uncertain route, and it is difficult for most people to know the proper steps to take. In this article, we will give you the information that you need to know before starting your own check cashing business.

The first and often most difficult hurdle in starting your own check cashing business is the initial investment. On average, the start-up costs for a check cashing business can range anywhere from $50,000 to $150,000, and unless you have a substantial savings, you will need to have solid credit in order to secure financing. In addition to paying for a location and having funds available to actually cash checks, there are many other expenses that you may not think of initially. For example, you need to figure in the cost of computers, furniture, monthly expenses (electricity, heat, etc.), employees, insurance, rent, advertising, licenses, and fees just to name a few. In addition, by the very nature of dealing with money, a check cashing business needs to have certain security measures in place to keep both your assets and employees safe. This may require hiring the services of a check-scanning company (such as TeleCheck), security cameras, alarms, and special glass to protect your workers. As you can see, your start up investment will play a large role in determining future success.

The second thing that you must do before starting your own check cashing business is to acquire all of the proper licenses and permits. It is advisable that you check with your local and state authorities to make certain that you possess all the necessary documentation needed to operate a business. It is also worth mentioning that you will have to comply with the federal and state government’s usury laws, which are in place to prevent financial outlets from charging exorbitant interest rates.

Let’s say that you have cleared these first two obstacles; what step should you take next? You should now turn your attention towards hiring responsible, and more importantly, honest employees. It is crucial in a check cashing business to hire only the most trustworthy of people, so you should take any safeguard necessary to ensure this. This step should include an extensive interview as well as background and credit checks. Do not rush this part of the process just so you can open up your doors to the public. This is one instance where your patience and sound judgment will definitely pay off, and it could end up saving you a lot of money that could otherwise be lost to employee theft.

Starting your own check cashing business is a difficult and involved process. By covering all of your bases and following through on the information provided above, you should find yourself well on the way towards operating a successful and profitable check cashing business.
