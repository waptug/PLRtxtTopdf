Since a personal credit card provides us with the means to make life easier and more enjoyable, can you imagine what a merchant credit card account can do for your business? This type of account is more than just a line of credit. It is an entire service package that offers support to help your company flourish and grow. Of course, as with any other type of credit account, it is important to use it responsibly. The first step toward obtaining this type of financial and technical support is to submit an application. 

Finding a merchant credit card account company is not hard at all. You just have to check with bankers in your area to see if they provide this service and are willing to work with you. Barring that route, you can do an online Internet search to find merchant account providers who are accepting new clients. There are plenty of banks and professional lenders who are looking for entrepreneurs to work with. They often will take a chance on new business owners if they think you have the potential to become a trusted client. But first you will need to pass muster by demonstrating your company’s capabilities in a few distinct areas. One is that you have a solid credit history and are not in bankruptcy. A copy of your company’s credit history should be adequate proof for this requirement. A second criterion is that your business has enough income to meet the new expenses of a merchant account. Bank statements or an annual report should help with this concern. Another thing the lender will want to know is the type of business you are doing. If you traffic in pornography, are engaged in telemarketing, or have left a trail linking your company to some unsavory dealings, the underwriter may decline your application. Conditions can vary; so ask about the eligibility requirements before applying. 

The next step toward applying for a merchant credit card account is to submit the application. Some lenders provide an online form that you can submit electronically, although you may be charged a fee for this privilege. Other loan agents will let you download a print application that you can complete in ink and mail by U.S. post. Either way, you will probably receive a response to your application within a few days by e-mail or in a letter. If your application is accepted, you can immediately begin to use your credit line and service package to set up a credit card processing system. Working with an account associate, you can arrange to install a credit card processor at your store’s checkout area. Or you can buy a wireless model for several hundred dollars and take it with you on the road when you service computers or appliances, or make deliveries to homes or businesses. Discuss the applications of your new merchant account with the loan officer to clarify limits and equipment options for your company’s use. 

You won’t be able to enjoy the use of merchant services until you apply for them, so ask your preferred lender about the application process for a merchant credit card account.
