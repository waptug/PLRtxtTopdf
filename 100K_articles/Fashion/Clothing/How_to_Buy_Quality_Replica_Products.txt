Article Body:
Replica products are great if you don't want to spend lots of money on designer products. Replicas can be worn or used for work or play, and they often look and feel very similar to authentic designer items. There are replica handbags, replica watches (e.g. replica Rolex), replica jewelry, replica shoes, and many other items for the choosing. Unfortunately, all replica products are not created equal. These buying tips will help you determine if a replica is a high-quality item or if it should be avoided.

Do a Quality Check

Replica items should still be of exceptional quality even if they are "replicas." If buying an item from a local store or outlet, look over the item carefully and ask questions about how it was made and what materials were used. If buying replicas online, look at photos and read the description carefully. If you're not sure how an item was made, ask questions by email or live chat support. 

For replica handbags, look for qualities such as strong stitching instead of glue for the inside lining, proper markings, designer stamps, and serial numbers, sturdy hardware, and leather or leather-like material. Replica watches should be made of strong, durable materials. They are often gold-plated, but will have high-quality features such as waterproof, scratch-resistant, and a cloth or leather strap.

With any replica item, compare it to the original. Though the two will never be completely identical, there should be very close similarities in all materials used and how it's built. Compare a real Rolex watch to a replica Rolex. Compare a genuine Louis Vuitton Speedy 30 purse to a replica Speedy 30 purse. Compare an authentic Chanel handbag to the Chanel replica handbag. 

Some replica websites claim A+ quality, but will try to pass off cheap materials so they can make more profit on each replica sold. Having A+ quality is important, but make sure what they are saying is true and that they will back it up with a guarantee.

On the Web - Buy Only from Reputable Replica Companies
 
Check out a website before you buy online to be sure the company carries a good reputation. You can search for the company name to see if other replica buyers have had a good experience, or you can also check with the Better Business Bureau online. Also, be sure to use a credit card to make your purchase. This will protect you from fraudulent online sellers. Look for a replica website with a good shopping system set-up and a professional design with photos and descriptions of their replica products. 

Shipping for Replica Products

Make sure the company offers reliable shipping with online tracking and insurance options. Replica handbags can be expensive, anywhere from $100 to $400, so it's a good idea to purchase shipping insurance in case your item gets lost or damaged in the mail. When you receive your item, examine it closely to be sure it is exactly as the company said, with no flaws.

Besides all these, use plain common sense when buying a replica handbag, watch, shoes, or other products. If the company seems to be anything less than trustworthy, then don't take a chance - even if it means spending a little more on your replica products.
