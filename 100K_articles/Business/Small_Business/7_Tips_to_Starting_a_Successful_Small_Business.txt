Getting a small business off the ground is challenging to say the least. Here are some tips which will prepare the ground for running a successful small business.

<B>Have Goals</B>

This is where it all starts – the foundation for success. Know exactly where you are heading. What will the business ‘look’ like in the future? How will you know when your business is a success? When you wake up in the morning, do you know what actions you have to take to get you on the road to success?

<B>Take Action</B>

The difference between success and failure is down to the actions you take. The failures in life are the people who know what they have to do but never do it. The successful small business owners are people who take action on their ideas, ones who never say, “I wish I had done …”

<B>Seek Feedback</B>

There is a saying that feedback is the breakfast of champions. During the early days of your business you must continually seek feedback about all aspects of your business. What works? What doesn’t work? What needs changing slightly? Speak to customers, suppliers, your bank manager, your accountant - anyone who can provide you with a fresh perspective.

<B>Find Out What Do You Don’t Know</B>

You can’t expect to know everything about running a business. Undertake your own skills analysis and find out your areas for development. Once you know your knowledge gaps seek out courses, books and advice, which will get you on track.

<B>Be Focused</B>

Let no one distract you from achievement of your goals. At the start of every day get yourself into the frame of mind that you will only do tasks which will get you closer to your goal – nothing else matters.

<B>Take Risks!</B>

You will never achieve anything if you’re not prepared to jump off the cliff a few times! We’re not talking about risks which will put the business in jeopardy; just risks which are planned and thought out, yet at the same time test the edge!

<B>Think Positive</B>

Yes, the oldest cliché in the book, but totally true. See the positive in everything. If something has not gone right train yourself to ask, “What good has come out of this?” Understand that in every problem there is potential for good.
