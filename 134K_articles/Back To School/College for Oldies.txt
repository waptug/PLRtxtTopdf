College for Oldies

	The kids are older.  You are older.  You have more time on your hands.  You decide that it’s time to go back to school and finish your degree.  Now what?  There are several choices to consider.  First, you’ll need to research the schools in your area to find what works for you and your time.  There are courses you can take in the evenings, weekends, or even online.  You can take the traditional route and attend day classes.
	Evening and weekend classes are more informal and often smaller in class size.  You’ll find older students, parents, and grandparents.  Online courses can be worked on your own schedule but usually have a heavier homework load and harder tests.  You have to have a lot of self-discipline and motivation.  Day classes have more action.  Most students take classes during the day and the classes are larger.  
	Next, you have to enroll.  This involves admissions and orientation.  You might want to meet with a counselor to discuss your class options.  You’ll need to find out class requirements and schedules.  If you know what your major will be, you can meet with a counselor in that department.  They will tell you what you should take and answer most of your questions.  
	Registration can be confusing.  You have to work out the classes you want with what is available and fits in your schedule.  Once you get registered and know what your classes are, find your books and get ready to start school.  If it’s been a long time since you’ve been to school, expect that things will have changed a lot.  Enjoy the chance to learn new things and expand your mind.  And try not to roll your eyes at the giggly girls in your classes.
