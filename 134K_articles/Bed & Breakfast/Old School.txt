Old School

The Old School Bed and Breakfast of Arnegard, North Dakota, is a unique place to stay.  It was one literally a schoolhouse.  In 1963, due mainly to waning enrollment, the county voted to close the high school. Elementary classes were held at the school until 1976 when the school was closed for good. A small time afterward, the building was deeded to the city of Arnegard. Some time after that, the city deeded the building and a portion of the school grounds to a group known as The Friends and Alumni of the Old School. During the period that this group owned the facility, there was a roller skating rink, rural library and meeting areas located within the building. It has undergone a great deal of restoration and renovation for the purpose of housing a Bed & Breakfast.
