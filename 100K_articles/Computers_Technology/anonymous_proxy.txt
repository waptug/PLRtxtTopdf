How to Surf the Web Anonymously -- Part 1

So you're trying to surf a site like myspace, hotmail or yahoo mail from work or school and its blocked by your school, work or government.  Or maybe you want to go on a site without anyone knowing what your doing.  The simplest way to do it is by using a web proxy.  A proxy is another computer that is like a mask your computer puts on when it connects to the Internet.  It's also a private gateway to blocked sites because the site you are actually surfing is hidden behind the proxy, which is unblocked.  For example, if you go to a web proxy in London and surf the Web, every other computer in the world thinks you are from London!

There are plenty of free web proxy sites that you can use.  The problem is that many of the popular ones also get blocked by people at your school, company or government.  However, once you find one that is not blocked, all you do is go to the proxy site, enter the URL you want to browse and click go!  Its that easy.  You can then click on any links in the page you are browsing and you're still anonymous to the outside world.  Just remember that if you go to a proxy and its blocked or no longer works, its no big deal, there are thousands of them.  Just try another one and eventually you will find a web proxy that lets you browse freely and privately.  Part 2 of this article will show where to find more unblocked working proxies that you will ever need!
