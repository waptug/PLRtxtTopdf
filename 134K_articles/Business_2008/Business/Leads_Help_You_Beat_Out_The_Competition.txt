A lead can be described as an individual or a group of persons, who have similar interests in a service or a product. There are many ways of acquiring leads, with the more traditional method such as advertising in newspapers and other media, to telemarketing, to purchasing leads from lead generation companies etc. However, these methods nowadays are not as impressive and productive as they were just a couple of years back. Nevertheless, if executed properly, these lead generation methods can still yield productive results.

In this modern era of computer technology and the advent of the internet, it has become much easier to search for and qualify targeted leads. To search for leads online, it is a plus for the sales agents to have a working knowledge of internet marketing and effective and cutting-edge search tools.

In competitive industries such as the insurance industry, generally many companies and agents vie over customers. One way for companies or agents to get a leg up on their competition and to get targeted success is to purchase and to use high-quality, highly qualified and targeted leads which could easily be converted into their business customers.

Nowadays, lots of online companies offer various kinds of leads such as mortgage leads, mlm leads, marketing leads, insurance leads and other business leads. The procedure of searching for and qualifying leads online is very simple. When targeted prospects come across the lead generation company's web site, they are asked to fill out a form on the lead provider's web page, often in exchange for free and useful information or resource. The lead providing company then collects and sorts these prospects information, such as the name of the prospect, contact number, email and the address, and then sells this information to any sales agent in need of these leads. Upon receiving these leads, the sales agent then proceeds to contact the leads listed and to offer further relevant information and quotes on the product or service, and to hopefully close the sale.

On the basis of quality there are mainly two kinds of leads:

Competitive Leads: These leads are not fresh and exclusive, and are sold multiple times to multiple companies or buyer. They are usually cheaper, but the prospect is not as open or responsive to calls or offers from agents.

Exclusive Leads: Theses leads are sold exclusively to one buyer only. Because of this, these leads tend to be more expensive. The advantage is that these leads may be more responsive to your offer.

Regardless of what type of leads you use, leads are bound to improve your performance and sales.
