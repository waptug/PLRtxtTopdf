Blue Heron Inn


Idaho is more than just mines and potatoes. Located on the south fork of the Snake River is The Blue Heron Inn. It's rustic exterior gives way to unmatched luxury and hospitality. Many of the neighbors will be seen walking by, such as moose and deer. Making their home in the nearby woods one can find Squirrels, Marmots, raccoons, beavers and foxes. It is not uncommon to see Blue Herons fishing for their next meal in the nearby Snake River or see eagles and osprey flying overhead. Nothing about Idaho is small as can be seen by the size of the rooms at the Blue Heron Inn.

The namesake room, The Blue Heron Suite is larger than some houses, or so it appears. The king size bed in the center of the room facing the French doors takes up less than a quarter of the space. For those chilly Idaho nights there is even a river rock fireplace. 

At first glance, the décor of the Canyon Suite is reminiscent of the southwest. One is reminded of the Navajo when the king sized bed is first viewed. The French doors open to a private balcony allowing breathtaking views of the south fork of the Snake River. 

The ducks of the same name inspired the Mallard room. A handmade quilt adorns the log bed and is accompanied by the pine furniture. For a more private retreat, the Carriage house is a second floor room attached to the innkeeper's residence. Since we are in the west, the Bunkhouse Suite is expected. You will think you've stepped into history with all the log furnishings. The handcrafted pine queen sized bed is the centerpiece of the Southfork Suite. Idaho's state bird is honored in the Blue Bird Suite. Here we find a brass bed with a marble topped dresser.
