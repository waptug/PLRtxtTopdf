Article Body:
Traveling to Pennsylania Dutch Country in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, is somewhat like taking a trip back in time. Long inhabited by the Amish who are actually Germans, the area is checkered by family farms where the men still work with horse and plow, the women bake everything from scratch, and families get around by horse drawn carriage.

While there, you can purchase homemade goods including jellies and jams; blankets and pillows; wood carvings; handmade furniture; outdoor items including birdhouses; and so much more. Try the fudge... YUM! Sit down for a traditional Amish meal served family style. You will share a long table with complete strangers while being waited upon by pretty maidens. Savor the tender meats, homemade noodles, gravy laden mashed potatoes, and breads and pies that will be part of your dining experience.

Located between Harrisburg and Philadelphia, the area is seeing a building boom. Some of the Amish are moving away, but many do remain. Lodging is very reasonable and more than likely you will stay at an Amish run establishment. 

The Amish are a quiet, thrifty people possessing a good business acumen. Many sincerely revere Almighty God and it shows more in their mannerisms than in their dress which has changed little over the centuries.
