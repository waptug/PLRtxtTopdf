Some search applications allows you to locate files in Microsoft word document, Adobe Acrobat, Internet explorer and more. Not only PDF files are searchable if you manage a wide variety of file types in your computer. In addition, of course, if the hard disk contains many of these files, you will have the hard time in finding the files you need in the shortest time possible.

In some search assistant applications, disk searching is not applicable instead, it only allows you to create an archive and make an index for the files. However, in some type of search assistant applications you can both search the index files or the even the disk itself.

Search index is one option in an assistant program that allows you to search for the index you have created. Well, creating an index is not as difficult as you think it is. The program will teach you to do it step-by-step and it's as easy as 123. In order to find the index easily, the index setting must be adjusted according to your preference.

There are options that allow you to make an automatic updates with the files if in case recent changes in the files are done. Then the index can be saved in the most convenient folder that you find easier to remember.

In searching an index, all you have to do is type a keyword of the file you have made. This is easier because you do not need to remember the whole text of the file most especially if you have tons of files in your hard disk. All you have to do is fill out the search information window that is requesting for a specific search.

It includes the keyword of the file, where you want to search the certain file, the exact file size, the date of the file and the search option. Of course, if you do not remember any of these, just typing the keyword is enough and the rest will be done for you.

This aid is applicable to popular types of files being used nowadays. This can also be used like a search engine for html files for better recovery of internet links and information. Excel spreadsheets, Adobe PDF files and Word Documents are also searchable through the index. This function almost resembles that of the index at the back of a book.

Think of your computer as your huge electronic book, like an encyclopedia, with many files in it. If you do not have your index, you'll end up clicking, opening and scanning each file for the exact information you are looking for.

It is true that if you keep numerous and diversified files in your archive, the lesser chance there is for you to remember them and their contents as well. Remember that the human brain cannot accommodate a lot of memories and data. We have to use the technology to help us remember things daily. Therefore, in using a tool to search the index, you will be more productive and efficient with your work. The lesser time wasted, the more essential things done.
