If you’re buying a computer desk for yourself, it can be difficult to know what to get, especially if you have never bought one before and have no idea about ergonomics. Remember that ergonomics isn’t just about stopping injuries when it comes to computer desks – it’s also like a kind of feng shui, making your work space the best possible one for you to be in.

You don’t need to go all-out on spending lots of money on some great kind of wood for your desk – something cheap from a DIY shop or Ikea should be fine. The important things are how big it is, where you put it, and its shape. 

You should measure the space the desk is going in beforehand and make sure that any desk you buy will fit comfortably – there are few things worse than a crowded work room. If the room is too small to fit a desk comfortably, you might want to reconsider using it.

The ideal desk will have a slide-out tray of a size that can easily fit a keyboard, as well as a shelf underneath for a printer or scanner. Nothing should be too near the floor, as it’s not good to be bending down all the time – ideally the computer’s system box should fit on top of the desk, to allow you to turn the computer on, put in discs and so on without bending down.

If you can, make room for a piece of paper and a pen on your desk too – it’s good to be able to jot things down easily and have somewhere to put any pieces of paper you need to make use of, instead of having to perch paper on the side of your keyboard. The time and effort you save this way is well worth the tiny amount of extra space it requires.
