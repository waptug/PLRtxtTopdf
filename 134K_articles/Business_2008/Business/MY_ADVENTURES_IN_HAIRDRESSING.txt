Article Body:
After years in the beauty business my small group decided to open a salon 
together, we had no idea what we were in for but we moved forward. We planned, 
designed and built our dream salon and spa in about 9 months in Santa Fe, NM 
which is probable one of the hardest cities in the country to open a salon 
and spa in but what the heck, "we have a concept, a goal and an idea." Our 
idea was to create a salon and spa that was comfortable for both operators 
and clients alike. Our concept was and now is to work with the local rape 
crises center in order to better the lives of women in need of a little pick- 
me-up. We created a company we named "B beautiful," our goal is simple and 
that is to create an asset to the community a salon and spa that cares enough 
about its staff to try and consider health, dental and a 401K. The B 
beautiful group's idea of creating a comfortable and elegant environment for 
both clients and operators to enjoy was easy. Getting people to fill the 
positions was and is not so easy at all.
