First things first, I always find music as a way to relieve stress. So having to hear good music is one thing that is best for our daily life. 

Once we heard of a good song we usually first try to find out what is the title of the song before the artist who sang the song. Before we just allow ourselves to listen via the radio or luckily via the television set. But with the technology we have we can hear our favorite song almost every second of the day. How is it? Because of the internet, the internet provides us so many things through information, music, movies, games, or any updates around the globe. 

Let us go back to our main topic, How to download MP3 music, or any music forms such as WMV, WMA, MIDI etc. 

Let first answer this question, how do we look for an MP3 Song of our favorite artist? Using the internet we search our favorite song to the music related sites if you are familiar with the internet, or simply by using Google, Yahoo or MSN Search Engines. Upon browsing these search engines we tend to type in the usual text "Download Song Title - Artist" then the search engines will provide lists of related sites/pages from the query that was provided, and thus look for the listings of the possible sites which you can download the music. I can probably say that this method is correct but with the information being updated almost daily this type of method is outdated. 

Today, downloading music is just one simple code away from the search engines. If you are familiar with blogging through blogger.com or multiply.com then you know what I am talking about. Most of these blog sites offers file storing for files such as music, pictures and other forms. So now you ask me "What are you talking about?" What I am saying is download of music is easy. From Google Search Engines just type in "Song + download + blogspot.com or multiply.com" this query will provide results with a download link from the favorite song that you wanted. 

By browsing one page from the results page came from the search engines, you can see that the song that you wanted can be download easily. So I'll explain to you the download process. Downloading MP3 song is not hard to follow, upon seeing the link for the favorite song that you wanted make sure that it is in MP3 format being hovering over the link and looking at the status bar below the web browser (e.g. Internet Explorer, FireFox) once you saw and extension file of mp3 upon hovering then the link is ready for download. If you are using Internet Explorer just right click over the link and select "Save target as", if you are using FireFox, again just right over the link and select " Save link as", just as easy as that ang you can download you favorite mp3 song.

But with downloading mp3 songs, you must be responsible enough to use this for your own purposes and not for commercial use
