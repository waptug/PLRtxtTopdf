Have you ever seen a photo blanket before?  Better yet, have you ever heard of a photo blanket before?  If you have never seen or heard of a photo blanket before then you are missing out on something amazing.  Photo blankets are the new way to create and preserve memories for years to come.  

A photo blanket is a blanket with a black and white or color photograph constructed onto it.  There are many individuals who automatically love the concept of combining a photo and blanket together; however, others do not. If you are one of those individuals it is likely that you are wondering why you would need a photo blanket.  The reason is simple because it could add a personalized touch to your home.  

Making a photo blanket is not as easy as it is to make a photo t-shirt.  There is a lot more design and skill that must go into developing a photo blanket.  Because a photo cannot simply be ironed onto a blanket it is often difficult or impossible for an average individual to do without the proper training. For this reason many photo blankets are purchased from a company or an individual who makes them for a profit.  The easiest way to find an individual or company who specializes in making photo blankets is by using the internet.  Simply by keying the words photo blanket into a search engine you should be provided with a list of photo blanket makers.  

While the internet has made it easier to find blanket makers they have also made it easier for low-quality products to be purchased.  When trying to select an individual or company to design your photo blanket you will want to make sure that you know who you are dealing with.  A company website should offer any relevant training or experience and it should definitely show photographs of completed blankets. If you purchase a photo blanket from an individual or a company who does not provide samples or important information you are putting yourself at risk for being scammed into paying a large amount of money for a low-quality product. 

The amount of time it will take for your photo blanket to be completed will all depend on the individual who is making it. If you need a photo blanket for specific time or event you are encouraged to place your order well in advance.  Once the completed product is received you can do whatever you want with it.  Whether you choose to cuddle with your blanket or put it away for safe keeping you will likely be pleased that you made the purchase.
