Unique Baby Shower Gift Ideas

Selecting what to bring for a baby shower party can be a difficult task.  Any guest would like to give a gift that can be useful to the baby or the parents.  Nobody would like to have his or her gift stashed in a closet or to given away to charity without being used first by the recipient.

Therefore, one has to make sure that he or she has chosen the baby shower gift properly so it will not be wasted.  As much as possible, never select a baby shower gift that the parents may already have.  Sometimes, the baby shower invitation says what the parents would like to receive.

If it is not on the invitation, you can also call the mom to ask what she would like to receive or what else she would need.

At times when the parents seem to have prepared well for the baby, you can select unique baby shower gifts that would serve as decorative items and remembrance.

Here are some unique baby shower gift suggestions.

* Birth Announcement Plates

These are decorative plates that come in pastel colors and different designs.  These can also be personalized with the baby's name.  Some companies also offer printing the baby's picture on the plates.

The plates may be used to contain food.  However, many chooses to have these plates displayed somewhere in the house.

* Personalized Ornaments

These ornaments are made from ceramic tiles that can be displayed on cabinet or shelves.  These can be personalized to contain the baby's name or picture.  You may also give a poem to the engraving company so it will be included in the ornament.

* Personalized Baby Blankets

These blankets come in pastel colors with different designs.  These can be personalized to include the baby's name.  Before deciding to give one, make sure that the parents hadn't bought or will not be receiving several blankets during the baby shower party.

* Pillows

Pillows can also be personalized with the baby's name.  These come in several colors and designs.

* Personalized Name Frame

If the baby's name was already chosen, you can choose a personalized name frame.  This will contain the baby's name with it's meaning, usually the biblical or historic association of the name.  It may also have a poem dedicating the gift to the baby or wishing the baby and the parents well.

* Piggy Bank

The parents can start the baby's savings with a personalized piggy bank.  The parents may drop coins each day after the baby is born.  When the child is older, he or she can continue saving money with this decorative piggy bank.

* Baby Naming Book

If the parents still hadn't decided what name to give to the baby or if they are not yet sure of the baby's gender, the baby-naming book is a great gift for the baby shower.  The book contains name selections from the bible and historical figures.  The meanings of the names are also given as well as the variations and origins in different countries and cultures.

* Music CD

Music has been proven to enhance the creativity and eliminate stress.  For babies, music can help them have quality sleep and boost their creativity and intelligence.  This is a perfect gift for the baby and the parents.

Regardless of the gift that you have chosen, always include a card to express your thoughts and your joys in sharing the celebration with the baby' parents.
