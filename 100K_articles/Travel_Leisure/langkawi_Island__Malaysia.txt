For those looking for a different cultural experience, or even just a great holiday destination, then adding Malaysia to your travel list will not disappoint. A Malaysian holiday can be a relaxed resort style getaway on one of the islands such as Sabah or Langkawi, bargain shopping and sight-seeing in the capital Kuala Lumpur, or perhaps a combination of both to let you experience the diversity of this amazing country. 
Langkawi situated just off the northwestern coast of Peninsular Malaysia comprises a group of 104 tropical islands during the low tides and 99 Island during the high tides. The main island Langkawi, is 47. 848 Hectare followed by Pulau Dayang Bunting and Pulau Tuba while some of the others appear to be mere dots in the emerald green ocean when viewed from the air. In Langkawi a nature adventure had a true-blue naturalist as their guide. 
Information from encyclopedia: "Langkawi is the biggest in an archipelago of 99 islands lapped by the warm, tropical waters of the Andaman Sea. The cluster of islands is separated from the mainland by the Straits of Melaka. Langkawi is noted for its legends and beautiful views. Beneath the clear blue water lies a technicolour world of the most amazing tropical marine life. While on the surface there are plenty of romantic white sandy beaches." 
Airport Transfers by far the easiest and cheapest way to get from the airport into the capital is via the KLIA Express (airport express train). The train is very modern with video screens showing points of interest and things to do in Malaysia while you enjoy a comfortable ride into Kuala Lumpur in around 35 minutes. Using a bus or taxi transfer will normally take around one hour by comparison and cost a little more. An added convenience when using the KLIA Express to connect with a departing flight is the facility to book your luggage onto your flight from the central train station in Kuala Lumpur (providing you do this at least 2.5 hours before your flight). 
Taxi Fares always ask how much the fare will be to get to your destination before getting into the taxi. Taxi fares in Malaysia are for the most part quite reasonable however at times a naive traveler can be easy pickings, especially on a return trip from an outlying area so be sure to ask for the cost of the fare beforehand and if it seems too high then you can usually find another taxi to get a better deal. The exception to this however is during peak hours in Kuala Lumpur when you will pay more because of traffic delays. Your hotel concierge can advise you on what the busiest traffic times are likely to be. Planning your movements around the capital outside of these times will save you money if you're on a tight budget.
Other than its wonderful beaches, its beautiful legends are what draws a visitor to its shores. The legends are all the more real simply because its people are convinced of their authenticity. As such, a keen sense of mystique and mystery surrounds the island and lends charm and intrigue to an otherwise quiet and calm facade. 
Langkawi, being in the northern region of Malaysia and so near the borders of Thailand, has an extra twist to its food. Original settlers included Thais - well known for their use of spices as are the Malays and Indians, and Chinese - who tend to favour herbs and certain spices. This influence is readily apparent in the food of Langkawi. 
The Langkawi of today boasts of many modern amenities and infrastructure while still retaining its traditional facade. World-class resorts and golf courses have been built alongside the more traditional accommodation of chalets and rest houses. This island of scenic, tranquil landscapes has become an extremely popular destination for both local and international visitors. It is an idyllic retreat from the urban jungle.
