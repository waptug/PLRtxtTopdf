Article Body:
Enjoy some of the most spectacular views that Colorado has to offer while you sample gourmet food, sip on fine wines and chug microbrew.  Everyone receives a commemorative wine glass or beer pilsner and unlimited samples of food and drink.  Even though this should be enough to satisfy most anyone, there is a whole lot more going on at the Rocky Mountain Wine, Beer & Food Festival.

This famous event is held at the base of Winter Park Resort where you can find a 600 mile hiking and mountain biking trail system that spreads throughout the beautiful Fraser Valley.  Winter Park is also home of the longest Alpine Slide in Colorado!  A 3000 foot long slide, with a 600 foot drop winding through the wilderness. Take a chair lift to the top of Winter Park Mountain and you can find an 18 hole disc golf course, as well as 360 degree views of the Rocky Mountains.  Back at the base there is also a miniature golf course that takes you through Fraser Valley history, a climbing wall, Rock N' Roll Gyro, Human Maze, Leaps & Bounds Bungee and a whole lot more.

Proceeds of this event will benefit the National Sports Center for the Disabled, which is one of the most important organizations found at Winter Park Resort.
