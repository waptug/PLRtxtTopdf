Summary:
With technology progressing in leaps and bounds, things will become redundant. New developments require new products. This is true for most of the things that we use, and electronic components are among them. After all, this is how it has always been.

With technology progressing in leaps and bounds, things will become redundant. New developments require new products. This is true for most of the things that we use, and electronic components are among them. After all, this is how it has always been. The new will constantly enter the scene and take the place of the old. That is how progress works after all.

There can be many reasons why electronic components may become obsolete. One of the most common reasons is that the products that use the components might have become obsolete. If a product has a short life cycle, it follows that the components that it uses will become redundant along with it. Thus, when that product goes out of the market and manufactures cease, it may herald the end for the components that it uses.

One of the reasons for components becoming obsolete has been the various government policies. Some time ago, when the European Union decided to ban some hazardous parts, component buyers were hit hard. In this case, among the parts to go were those that were not lead-free. With the EU ban in place, buyers using components made of lead or the other banned substances were hit hard. This was especially a problem in places like the United States, where the law pertaining to hazardous substances was not valid.

One of the effects that the banning of specific components have is that entire machinery could become obsolete as a result. For instance, it is not always all right to use non-leaded components in machinery that uses leaded parts. This is because the temperatures that are required are not the same. Thus, if manufactures cease for one part, several others may be facing the ends of their lives.

Of course, a number of pieces of the various components shall remain with suppliers. However, it is safe to say that finding these components could be quite a difficult task. Some semiconductors may become tough to locate and it may become difficult to locate obsolete integrated circuits. End of life electronic parts remain with a few suppliers to assist people who have no other choice but to use the old machines.

Nowadays, however, one can easily find the people who do store obsolete electronic components. Doing an online search for "end of life electronic components" should provide effective results. With buyers and suppliers looking for trade in electronic components even on the Internet, things have been simplified a great deal.
