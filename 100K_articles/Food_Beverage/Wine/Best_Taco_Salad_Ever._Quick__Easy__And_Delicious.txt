This taco salad is a favorite at my house. You can adjust the ingredients to suit the taste of your family members and/or guests. It is easy to prepare and always seems to be a hit.

Ingredients Needed:

Lettuce (pre-shredded)
1 lb. Ground meat
Chipotle seasoning or taco seasoning mix
Cheese (pre-shredded)
1 can black beans
1 can corn (optional)
1 can sliced ripe olives (optional)
1 avocado
1 small onion
1-2 tomatoes
1 bottle Ranch dressing
1/3 cup sour cream
tortilla chips

Directions:

Chop onion in small pieces. Add onion to ground meat. Season the meat with Chipotle seasoning or Taco Seasoning mix and cook in the microwave using Tupperware’s Oval Microwave Cooker with the colander to drain the grease from the meat or brown the meat and onions together in a frying pan on the stove.

If using the microwave cook the meat for 6 minutes per pound.

If cooking on the stove cook the meat until it is well browned.

In the meantime, pour lettuce into a large bowl to begin the salad. Tupperware’s Chip N Dip works well for this salad because you can use the dip bowls for salsa and dressing.

Open and drain the black beans, corn, and sliced olives and add to the salad. Next, add the shredded cheese.

Drain your cooked meat well and add to the salad.

Chop tomatoes and avocado and add to the salad.
Next, make the dressing. Mix ½ bottle of ranch dressing, 1/3 cup sour cream, and 1 tsp of chipotle seasoning or taco seasoning mix. Make sure to blend the dressing well.

Serve the tortilla chips in a separate bowl so everyone can add the amount of chips they want for their salad.

Serve salad with dressing and salsa on the side.

This is a simple recipe that you and your guests are sure to enjoy.

If you prefer home-made salsa to store bought salsa to go with your salad, you can make your own using the following recipe.

Use a chopper that mixes or a blender. The Quick Chef from Tupperware is what I use. If you have one or something similar, try using it. They are usually easier to clean up then a blender.

You will need the following ingredients to make the salsa.

One 16 oz can of tomatoes with basil and oregano added
Half a large onion
Garlic or garlic powder to taste
Cilantro to taste
Chipotle seasoning to taste

Use the Quick Chef or blender to chop the onion. Use a garlic presser to press the garlic and add to the onions. Open the can of tomatoes and add it to the onions. Add cilantro to taste. Add chipotle seasoning to taste. Mix all the ingredients well and serve with your taco salad.

I like my salsa mildly hot so I add a teaspoon of chipotle seasoning. If you want your salsa to come out spicier simply add more chipotle seasoning.
