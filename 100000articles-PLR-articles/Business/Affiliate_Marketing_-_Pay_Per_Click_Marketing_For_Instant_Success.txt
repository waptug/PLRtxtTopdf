Pay Per Click Marketing is an affiliate marketing skill practiced only by successful affiliate marketers. The reason for this is that most affiliates do not fancy the idea of spending money every time there is a click on their ads and one can lose money if there is not a solid business plan in place. Pay Per Click Marketing in the right hands is the fastest way for anyone to get results online, in hours or days from the day the ad was placed.

Getting started in Pay Per Click Marketing is very simple. All we need to do is go to any one of the major search engine providers such as Yahoo Search Marketing, MSN Marketing and Google AdWords Marketing and setup an account. Setting up an account requires a debit or credit card. This is also a possible hurdle for some interested in online marketing but unable to get started because of lack of this tool. Many banks now allow their ATM cards to function as a visa card,

Pay Per Click Marketing never gets saturated. Compared to other forms of advertising such as ezine advertising that can generate sales...however one needs to place ads, or solo ezine ads to test if the subscribers to an ezine newsletter is responsive to an ad. So its either a hit or miss. For this same reason, PPC is especially good for affiliates in the MLM or network marketing arena that are looking for ways to generate leads for their business. For example, while your upline may have success advertising a business opportunity in a certain ezine with 5000 subscribers, over time that pool becomes saturated with the same ad and this resource pool will no longer be beneficial to the sponsors downline.

PPC however takes some skill and time to understand the intricacies of the advertising system. The best way to succeed in PPC is to have a business model that is long term, in other words, we need a business plan that either has got many products we can introduce in time, a recurring charge business model such as a membership site or a high ticket item. Once the business model is in place, we can send instant traffic with AdWords, Yahoo, or MSN.

All the best to your internet business,
