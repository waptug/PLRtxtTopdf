Shopping for a Pre-school

	When you make the decision to send a child to preschool, there are many different things to look for and some will depend on your circumstances.  We all want the best for our children and we want the preschool experience to be a success for our children.  The attitude they have when attending preschool can have an effect on how they view school later.
	Decide what your needs are.  You might be looking for a preschool to give your child some social skills and teach them basics such as colors, shapes, and letters.  You might be looking for a place to take your child while you go back to school during the morning hours.  Or you might be working and need full-time daycare.
	When shopping for a preschool, keep in mind the things that are most important to you.  First impressions might not be the best when you are walking into a center full of children – chaos might be reining.  Meet with the director and find out what their preschool program involves.  Take a tour of the school and meet the teachers.  Look at the classrooms – notice the bulletin boards and the mood of the children.  You can also arrange a time to meet specifically with the teacher.
	After your visit, write down your impressions and what you liked and did not like.  Write down any follow up questions you might have.  When you have visited all the preschools on your list, decide which one you prefer.  Take your child back for another visit and ask to go into the classroom with him.  See how your child reacts.  Watch how the teacher addresses your child when they meet them and how the other children respond.  If the atmosphere seems friendly and fun, this is probably a good choice.
