Yoga is one of the many forms of exercises that have influenced millions of people around the world. Unlike yoga classes it is also time efficient for all of us. This is because you can practice yoga anytime you like unlike from classes, which has a definite schedule. 

It is also much convenient because they are always ready whenever you are. In these said videos we could also practice with renowned teachers in yoga and we can feel its thrill to practice with them. 

One of the best power yoga instructors is Bryan Kest. But even if his studio is in California and even if we live in far places we could still practice with him by using his videos. 

We could also choose which practice we should do and base it in what we need at a specific time. 

It might focus on stress reduction, one that helps our upper body, or one that helps build our core. 

It might also focus on what suits our physical situation such as pregnancy yoga or yoga for seniors. 

And lastly in this practice of yoga videos we could modify the postures according to our physical conditions. For example if we have an injured foot and we can’t put any pressure on the front of it we should modify a number of poses such as the Plank Pose ( in where we need to put our knees down so we wont bear our entire weight of our body on our forefoot only).

Sometimes it takes a lot of extra movements to get into our desired positions because of our injuries especially if we are on a regular class with other persons. Moreover, Yoga videos offer variety and assortment. One can easily get bored doing the same practice over and over again for how may sessions. 

The interest and enthusiasm is lost when there is a lack of diversity and mixture.

Some people may not really have enough time and have hectic schedules so this videos are just a few steps away from you plus, it is very convenient to carry almost anywhere without ease. Moreover, going to a Yoga class adds up to a few hours to go there and getting there on time is quite difficult. 

Finding a parking space, registering and getting space in class is also troublesome. Sometimes, you end up wasting your time and effort being there without much satisfaction at all.
