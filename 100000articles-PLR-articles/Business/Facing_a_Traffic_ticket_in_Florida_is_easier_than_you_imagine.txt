In this year citizens of Florida gave their opinion. They decided that they are no longer paying huge property taxes. They submitted their vote for reducing these taxes to 30 percent. This means that all government entities will have to decrease their expenses by 30 percent for rendering their services. All Government agencies have to decrease their budgets and sustain within 70 percent.

This has caused a frightfulness of some sort for Government agencies. This is because the budget they were using will no longer be available in this year. But, there is a method to recover the lost revenue. That remedy is to charge more amount for traffic tickets, traffic citations, parking tickets, speeding tickets and red light violations. What used to be a one-hundred dollar traffic citation is now changed to a four-hundred dollar traffic citation. You can say that as soon as the red lights start to flash behind you, you can hear your bank account go ‘Ka-chink’.

Yes, you may have to pay more amount for every driving fault because of this fact. Who can blame the police? The agencies have to work with less budget. The citizens of Florida have to suffer even more because the voters spoke out their voice. Therefore, they have also spoken back by saying, “we will charge more to all traffic citations and traffic tickets across the board”.
