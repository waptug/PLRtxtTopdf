By now, most people have at least heard of spyware removal programs, and many people have them on their computer. There are literally thousands of spyware programs available on the Internet. Although some of the spyware software is good, not all of it is. Typically, if you get a spyware program that isn't well made, it will simply do nothing. A lot of the spyware programs, you see, are designed by amateurs. They are only designed to catch and remove spyware from a few sources. They are updated infrequently, and as such cannot give your computer the protection that its needs. All they can do is give you a false sense of security which may lead you to take even bigger risks over the Internet.

Some spyware programs are downright malicious. Although they may look like spyware removal software, they are actually spyware themselves. These spyware programs are known as Trojan horse viruses. They pretend to remove spyware while actually installing it on your computer. If you are not a savvy computer user, you can literally destroy your data by downloading specious spyware software. You may think that you are protecting your computer, while you are actually destroying it.

This is why spyware programs are not the first step in cleaning up and protecting your hard drive. If you suspect that you might be infected with spyware, the first thing you should do is back up your hard drive. You do not necessarily have to back up the entire thing, but you at least have to back up the important data on it. Any mp3 music files that you want to keep, any text files or documents that are important, and any programs that you cannot live without, should all be backed up onto some type of storage medium. Only then should you download spyware programs to protect your computer hard drive.

You may think that you have to pay money for good spyware programs, but in fact many of the best ones are available for free. You can download Ad-Aware, a spyware protection program, for absolutely nothing from the Internet. Although there is a more highly rated Professional Edition that costs some cash, the free version works perfectly well for most computer users. It even gives you frequent spyware program updates to protect you from the latest spyware and viruses. There is no need to pay money for spyware programs if you know where to download them for free.
