You usually only hear about spy cameras being used in the movies. However, in the real world they are used for good and bad purposes. When they are used for security they can help catch criminals. There are people who will use spy cameras for their own selfish and bad reasons that are illegal. Let me explain what I mean.

There have been many options available through the times for protecting society from people who are breaking the law. However, with the proliferation of computers, complex political and social systems and industrialization there is a greater need for a heightened level of security. The police and military will continue to protect us from the criminals and terrorists of the world. 

However, there are also individuals that use other security services and private investigators to conduct their own investigations and to protect their families, properties and businesses. They use modern surveillance to help them protect what they feel strongly about. You will continue to see more and more houses that are equipped with spy cameras so that the families that live there can continue to be safe and to warn them of suspicious individuals. 

Spy cameras have become a more frequent method to use when you are trying to protect your home or business. These cameras are also known as a hidden spy camera, wireless spy camera or a wireless mini spy camera. These cameras are very small and can't usually be detected unless you know that they are there. 
The police and private investigators use them to help provide them with valuable leads and information that will help them catch the people who are breaking the law. They are also used to provide the courts with hard and accurate evidence against the criminals. The video from a spy camera doesn't lie and thus they are relied upon to help get criminals convicted. They are also great for helping to alarm us of robberies and crimes before they are actually committed. 

Most of the time these cameras are used in places that require a lot of security to protect their businesses and the customers of their business. Some of these places are banks, casinos, airports (to spot any crimes of terrorism), military facilities and even ATM's. These are just a few of the places that they are used.  

They are also used in private homes to protect children and the elderly citizens. People like to know that their loved ones are being protected and not abused. So they use a spy camera to help them determine that everything is as it should be in their homes. These cameras are also called nanny spy cameras, digital spy cameras, pinhole spy cameras and wearable spy cameras. 
There are people however that will use them for blackmail and prostitution. These are the people who are using them for illegal purposes. They are the ones that the police are trying to protect society against. 

You want to make sure that you know what spy cameras are being used for and make sure that you don't use them illegally. It is always a good idea to talk to a lawyer to find out what the laws are concerning these types of cameras.
