One of the things a lot of us enjoy is listening to music.  As a musician and songwriter, a great deal of my time is spent listening to or creating music.  Sitting at my synthesizer and spontaneously playing a tune is also one way I relax and unwind after a hard day.  Tickling the ivory is great when you want to relax your mind, and physically energize your body. Somewhat like physical exercise, playing a musical instrument releases pent-up anger and utilizes the extra adrenaline the human body produces when under stress.

Music is also therapeutic and vital to human beings and allows us to escape from the stresses and demands of our hectic and fast-paced lifestyle.  Forgetting the worries we carry around with us, music allows us to take a journey to a faraway place, without ever leaving our chair:  somewhere pleasant, exciting, and at the same time, stress-free.

Recording our favorite music on CD's, iPods, or creating play lists for our computers, we can simply develop our own compilation of  music-to-go and play them in cars, in the gym and while at work.  With the latest popular technological invention, the iPod, the prospect of musical fulfillment is endless.  The iPod can store a multitude of tunes and enables the listener to have virtually uninterrupted songs to enjoy whenever and wherever we choose. 

With all the current technological advances at our disposal, musical expression has come a long way, taking recording music and sound to the next level.  Whether you perform music or are an avid listening, most humans will agree:  Life would not be as colorful without some form of music to enrich our lives.
