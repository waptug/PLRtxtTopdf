Anime Collectibles:  Your Buying Options

Have you recently decided that you would like to start an anime collection?  If you have, you are not alone.  The anime genre has expanded well beyond what it was when it was first developed.  In fact, there are now kid-friendly anime books, films, and television shows.  What does this mean for you?  It often means more options when looking to start an anime collection.

Speaking of your options, when looking to buy anime collectibles, you will find that there are a large number of them. For starters, anime collectables can be purchased in a number of different conditions, including new and used.  There are also options in terms of purchase locations.  To have the best chance of success, when starting an anime collection, familiarize yourself with each of your options, as well as their pros and cons.

To get started, it is best to focus on conditions.  Many anime collectors choose to only purchase collectables that are brand new.  This is because there are a number of benefits to doing so, especially from the standpoint of a collector.  For starters, brand new anime collectables are in great, if not perfect, condition.  This also leads to another pro, which is a better value.  Rare or hard to find collectible that are brand new are likely to be valuable in cost.  However, should you wish to purchase these types of collectibles, you should expect to pay for the value.

As for used anime collectables, there are also a number of pros and cons to buying used.  One of the many pros or plus sides to buying used anime collectibles is the possibility to find rare items that were popular before anime collecting developed as a hobby. These are items that were likely used by individuals who did not know that the items in question had the possibility to become valuable one day.  Many buyers also receive discounts on used collectibles, as values decrease when collectibles are removed from their original package.  Although relatively easy to afford, it is important to keep value in mind, especially if you are looking to buying collectables that can later be sold for a profit.

As for your buying options, examine hobby shops, both on and offline.  Online hobby shops tend to provide you with a better selection of anime collectibles, but refrain from outright discounting your local hobby shops. The only downsides to buying anime collectibles from hobby shops is the focus.  Many specialize in collecting and other hobbies in general.  This is ideal for those with more than one hobby, but specialty anime collectors may want to look elsewhere.

For the best chance of finding rare, hard to find, and valuable anime collectables, anime dealers should be approached.  Although still rare, many locally owned and operated anime dealer businesses are starting to popup across the country.  This is due in part to the rise in popularity of the anime genre.  With that in mind, if you do not live in a large city, it may be best to examine online anime dealers.  These dealers can easily be found with a standard internet search.

Anime dealers are often considered the best source of collectibles, especially those that have the possibility to increase in value.  You are also likely to get a much better deal.  When using other approaches, such as online auction websites, many sellers decide to charge whatever they want.  This leaves a good chance of you paying too much money.  Although there are no guarantees, most anime dealers are professional and experts in the field.  This means that many have an accurate idea of what should be paid for a collectible.  Doing business with anime dealers also often reduces your chances of overpayment.

As highlighted above, you have a number of different buying options, when looking to start or expand your anime collection.  As a reminder, you never know what you may find, so you may want to examine collectable in both new and used conditions, as well as those sold by hobby shops, individual owners, and professional dealers.
