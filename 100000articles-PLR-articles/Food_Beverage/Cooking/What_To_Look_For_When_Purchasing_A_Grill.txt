For many of us, summer will forever be associated with grills. Grills mean Father’s Day cookouts, graduation parties, and relaxing family get-togethers. You may think that the scent of bratwurst on the grill is one of the best aromas around. Therefore, if you’ve just moved into a home with a deck—or an apartment with a patio—you may want to invest in a grill in order to make your time outdoors a bit more memorable.

Yet, finding the right grill for your particular lifestyle can be a challenge. This is because there are so many options to choose from. With so many choices available, you may not know where to begin as you conduct your search. However, if you keep a few simple things in mind, both the browsing and the buying process should be much easier.

Undoubtedly, an important consideration is the weight of a grill. Experts say that heavier gauge metal is far more durable. Therefore, if you want to buy a grill that’s really built to last, consider a heavy-duty model.

You’ll also want to decide what kind of fuel power you would like for your grill. A charcoal grill, for example, tends to add an intense smoked flavor to food. It can also be time-consuming, since it will take about 15 to 30 minutes after you light the grill before it will be ready for cooking. The higher-quality charcoal grills have air vents to control cooking temperature.

The main advantage of grills that use liquid propane or natural gas is that they burn cleaner and less expensively than charcoal. They also ignite quite quickly, thanks to a push-button, rotary or electronic lighter that is built right into the grill. After only ten minutes of pre-heating, you can begin to grill.

Meanwhile, if you live in an area that cannot really accommodate a charcoal or gas grill, you might want to invest in an electric one. Newer models tend to create a fascinating flavor—especially when you use a high-quality marinade. An electric grill is especially well-suited for residents of apartments. Yet, a key disadvantage is that the grill must be plugged into an electrical outlet.

Be sure to take your time when shopping for a grill. After all, you’ll want one that you will be happy with over the long term. The more time you invest in searching for the right grill, the happier you’re likely to be with your final purchase.
