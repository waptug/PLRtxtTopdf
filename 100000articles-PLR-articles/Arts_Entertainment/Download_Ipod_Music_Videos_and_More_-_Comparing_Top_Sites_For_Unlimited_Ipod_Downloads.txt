Article Body:
Are you searching for most popular sites on the internet for downloading unlimited ipod games, movies, music, etc.? Then you are at the correct place. This article points out various factors that should be taken care of before signing-up with any new ipod downloads site. The tips presented here will also be helpful if you want to compare these websites based on their price, popularity, convenience of use, satisfaction guarantee etc. Following are the question that you should ask your self before joining any ipod downloads service. 
1. How much is the collection of this site?
This is the first thing you should check with any site providing unlimited ipod downloads service. If the collection of movies, music, games etc. is not significant, then you should not see any point in subscribing with this website. Most of the ipod download sites on internet offers unlimited downloads service at just one time membership price, so it is not good to compromise the collection of files with just 4 or 5 dollars. 
2. Does this site offers Money Back Guarantee?
This is the second most important parameter to be considered. Once you know that site offers money back guarantee, you can easily try it out. You should make sure that the site should offer atleast 60 days money back guarantee. This much time will be enough for you to judge their quality. 
3. How much is the price?
This is third important thing. Now you can compare all the sites based on the price which they offer. If the site is offering good collection of ipod movies, games etc, and also with money back guarantee for significant trial period, you can proceed with the sign-up. 
4. Does this site offers full customer support?
At the first place, the good site will be one where you don't need any customer support. If you need it in the first 60 days, you should definitely cancel their service. In case of some minor problem, they should respond to you immediately.
5. What is the download speed?
This is another important factor, because if download speed is low, then no matter how large the collection of ipod files is, you can not get them transferred to your ipod in you life. You must ensure that a movie should be downloaded in just 20 to 30 mins. Also you should make sure that you should be able to start watching movie when its download is under progress.
