Grammy Award-winning vocalist Martina McBride has joined forces with Hallmark to create "My Heart," a Valentine's Day compact disc available exclusively through Hallmark.

In her hit songs from the past and present, McBride's powerful voice takes listeners on a romantic musical journey. The CD features two new songs - "At Last" and "Together Again," as well as six classics, including "Valentine," a duet with Jim Brickman that rose to No. 3 on the Billboard adult contemporary chart in 1997. 

In her remarkable career, McBride has sold over 13 million albums, had 20 top-10 hits and acquired more than 70 awards and nominations. 

"We are delighted about joining forces with such a highly respected and talented artist," said Ann Herrick, integrated marketing manager at Hallmark. "We feel fortunate to be working with an artist whose career is skyrocketing."

Hallmark has been featuring blockbuster artists on its holiday CDs since the mid-1980s. It recently completed a holiday CD with legendary artist James Taylor. 

"It's exciting to partner with a company that is not only known for being of the highest quality, but has actually set the standard for all others to follow," McBride said. "I have grown up with Hallmark, and the thought of my CD being in a Hallmark store is thrilling for me." 

"My Heart" is available from January 24 to February 14 at participating Hallmark Gold Crown stores nationwide. The album is regularly priced at $10.95 but will be sold for $6.95 with the purchase of any three Hallmark cards.
