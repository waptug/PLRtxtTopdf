Using Adobe Acrobat to convert PDF to text is generally a simple and straightforward process. Users can simply choose the PDF file the user wants to convert and software to convert PDF to text and either use the information as a backup or for publishing to the web for all to see. Either way, the use of PDF to text software is as common as the use of the ubiquitous Google toolbar. PDF to text software is very functional and serves the purpose of a lot of users to convert their PDF files quickly to text and publish them or use them as they see fit. Converting PDF to text is very convenient in the manner of publishing and editing, as dealing with the unwieldy PDF format can sometimes be difficult. Many users prefer not to open PDF files because of their high system resource demands and the Adobe Acrobat program has a tendency to crash older computers. PDF files can be slow to load, extremely large and can choke out older computers that aren't fully equipped to deal with such large files and so much text. Reading all the text in its continuing straight line can be difficult for older computers with slow processors and minimal memory. But converting these PDF files to basic plain text can change the way that your computer is affected by the amount of text. Without the additional overhead created by the Adobe Acrobat program and its dedicated resources, the computer can run much more smoothly and provide a text version of the PDF file that is under examination.

By converting PDF to text many simplifications can occur of previously written materials. Converting the PDF file to text can allow the user to edit, revise and publish information in a basic plain text format rather than the PDF file format. The PDF file format is not very popular with many users because of its high system resource usage. If you have ever opened up an Adobe Acrobat file and noticed your computer freeze for a few moments, this is because of the tremendous amount of overhead that the Adobe Acrobat program uses. Many users believe that this resource overhead is unnecessary for a text program and that the Adobe Acrobat program is unnecessary. Converting PDF to text allows users to forgo the use of the Adobe Acrobat program altogether, as any valuable content or information located in PDF files can simply be copied to basic plain text and stored elsewhere. This PDF to text conversion allows for a smaller file size and easier to navigate pages, as well as a universally formatted document that any web application or Microsoft computer user can manipulate and read without trouble. PDF files require the Adobe Acrobat reader. While the Adobe Acrobat reader is free, it requires an Internet connection to download and use. In the case of plain text the computer can read text in any basic format.

For these reasons converting PDF to text is a very popular function of much available software on the Internet, as users migrate away from using the Adobe Acrobat PDF format.
