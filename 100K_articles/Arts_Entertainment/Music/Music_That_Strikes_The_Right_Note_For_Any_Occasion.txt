Striking a responsive chord with music lovers is a service that will help them to "chill" or entertain them during the next road trip.

For example, some of the best music for a road trip comes from artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, OutKast, Green Day and The Who. Johnny Cash has a nice way to make those miles roll by as well. "I've Been Everywhere" will go a long way to lift your spirits.

When you're trying to find some music to just relax by, Air, Sade, Dido and Enigma will do the trick. Sade (pronounced Shar-day), the sultry smooth-jazz singer, provides music perfect for when you're with your significant other (think "Smooth Operator"). These are the opinions of the experts at BMG Music Service, who can help you find the perfect music for any occasion without spending a lot of time or money.
