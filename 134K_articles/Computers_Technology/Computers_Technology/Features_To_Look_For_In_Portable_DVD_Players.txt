If you have ever been on a long car trip with a couple of kids in the backseat, you know what a great piece of modern technology a portable DVD player is. Having a portable DVD player can pull kids attention away from each other, or worrying about how long until we get there, and get them focused on the movie, giving you some nice peace and quiet for the drive ahead. Portable DVD players can also be handy for anyone who travels on a regular basis, especially if you spend a lot of time in airport terminals or bus stations. Portable DVD players now come standard with many new vehicles on the market today.

Portable DVD players are still kind of pricey, so it is a good idea to have a budget and some well researched knowledge before going on your shopping trip. Many local department stores sell them in their electronics departments, and they can be put on layaway, which can help you purchase the portable DVD player you want without breaking your budget or robbing a bank.

Any type of large electronics purchase should be looked at as an investment, so it is important to try to get the most for your money. You should also look for a portable DVD player with a good warranty, and maybe even research the manufacturer first to see how well they stand behind their products and what kind of customer service they provide.
 
Many portable DVD systems now offer dual screens, which is great, especially if you plan to use it in your vehicle. These models are more expensive, but are a good investment if you have more than one child. It could prevent a lot of complaining about not being able to see the screen, which would definitely be a plus for the parent in the car.

You will also need to decide what size screen you need on your portable DVD player, depending on its’ function, and where you plan to use it at.

Another plus to portable DVD players is that many have the capability to also serve as CD/MP3 players as well, giving them a dual purpose.

There are many features available with portable DVD players, and you have to decide what will work best for your needs and fit in your budget. No doubt about it though, purchasing a portable DVD player can be a very worthwhile investment.
