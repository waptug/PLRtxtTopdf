Boating Life


There’s so much to be said for living the boating life.  Boaters have their own lifestyles.  They live on boats, take their families boating, attend boating events, give boating gifts, have a unique code of etiquette and love to laugh about boating and the boating life.  It’s a wonderful way to look at the world from the deck of a boat.

Boating Life magazine embraces this lifestyle and is perfect for anyone who loves the wind in their faces as they skim across the water.  Like many other boating magazines, this one offers its subscribers a plethora of information about the sport of boating.

Its sections include:

* Boat test drives
* Safety tips
* Boat maintenance
* Water sports
* Fun stuff
* And more!

There is a separate section for classified ads so you can look to buy products and even a new boat.  If you have some extra equipment you want to get rid of, list it in the classified section.  Want to upgrade to a bigger boat?  Boating Life’s classified section, again, is the perfect place.
