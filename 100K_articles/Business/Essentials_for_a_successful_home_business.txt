A normal common business sense, determination to succeed and investment money
Nowadays there are people willing to start a business online without having the sense what running a business is all about.
A business is something you plan and doesn’t come free by only registering your company. Once registering is done you can’t sit back and wait till money is coming in. Off course ads and other sources can tell us that money is coming in when you have signed up for something but it doesn’t work that way. A business owner has to face a lot of bad things opposed to the good things a business can bring. To cope with all these influences you need to stand strong and have a determination to reach your goals.
Then there is another factor that you can make money free without doing anything. Doing business is hard work and is surely not limited to a 9 to 5 job.

When a normal business day is over, then there are other tasks to perform to carry out your business as usual.  I mention administration, networking, taking care of your customers and other work that keeps your business going.  A common working week for a business owner can easily take up more than 60 hours and is not limited from Monday till Friday. 
Every business has to invest in order to succeed. Yes, there are many resources on the internet that you can use for free but for a good result you need to invest to secure your turnover on a later stage. 

A business can’t be build by having a separate room and a computer alone. Off course if you have these things already then you have made a start but it is necessary to invest time, effort and money to succeed.
