We are slowly moving towards a paperless world. The papers that create clutter on our desks and in the filing cabinets are now being stored on CDs and DVDs. Our computers hold all the information that we require, and we do not need to look anywhere else. The email is perfect for sending our important letters and messages. These can instantly reach the concerned person's mailbox in less time than it takes to print a letter, fold it, and put it in an envelope. It is both convenient and quick. And as long as there is seamless Internet connectivity, there is little likelihood of there being a delay in the mail reaching the required person.

Thus, it should not be at all surprising that faxes have also started making use of the Internet. The old fax machine seems to be on its way out as Internet faxing becomes increasingly popular. This is yet another consequence of our world becoming increasingly paperless. Now, our personal computers have decided to replace the old fax machines and are allowing us to access important and urgent messages without worrying that inquisitive people will go through our confidential information. The risk of confidential information falling into the wrong hands was a disadvantage of the public fax machine. However, this shortcoming can be eliminated if one uses the Internet fax.

As offices move towards complete computerization, the public fax machine is fast becoming defunct. Although quite a few of them continue to survive, we could soon be seeing a world where the fax machine shall be absolutely defunct. The fax by email service is gaining in speed as the favored mode of faxing important messages and information. And it is an improvement on the fax machine of the days of yore. In the case of email faxes, one does not have to stand in line. One does not have to worry about the leaking out of confidential information. And the likelihood of a faxed document being misplaced is low. After all, unless you press the delete button, the fax will not be going anywhere. And even if you do delete it, you should manage to restore it from your trash.

It no longer makes much sense to hold on to the old fax machine in today's world. The email fax service is far more convenient and efficient. One can send out innumerable faxes without even walking out of the office. This certainly is yet another example of technology adding to our comforts.
