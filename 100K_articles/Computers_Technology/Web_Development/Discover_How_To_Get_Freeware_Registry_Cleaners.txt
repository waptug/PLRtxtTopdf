Based on past facts i can say that most Pc’s, and that includes new pcs will have some kind of corrupted file somewhere inside the computer. If you’ve ever had a blue screen on your Windows system, or have it crash, you’re one of the many people who experience this inconvenience. I’m just letting you know that you might get a different problem with your registry is with Microsoft’s core system which it’s associated with.

Inside your registry you’ll find data relating to your hardware profiles on your computer along with your application settings. The registry is the brain or I should say the mind map of your between what you want to do and how it is displayed on the screen.

The registry is the brain or I should say the mind map of your between what you want to do and how it is displayed on the screen, and the grievous of them all is when you install new program you’re registry will update and it might cause your new program not to run efficiently.

Suppose you’ve corrected your registry most errors that were there in the first place might not have been completely removed. From my experience, as time goes by you’re going to eventually install new programs and hardware into your computer, and you’ll also be uninstalling them so you run the risk carrying useless and invalid registry entries; this will most definitely prevent your computer from ever running smoothly again.

Ok, now that I’ve scared you, here are two possible solutions that might help solve you crashing Windows.

1. First thing you’re going to do is make a backup copy of your registry.

2. Buy or get yourself a free registry repair utility. Please make a note that this is the best solution and keeping a backup copy of your registry is also another method to use along with this. If you’ve got yourself this tool you can begin scanning your registry and fixing any errors it finds automatically. Fixing invalid entries in your registry is now possible with these types of tools because you don’t need any knowledge about registries to scan repair it.

Never used this type of software before? Don’t worry it runs on automatic and if you want you can play with the settings to scan specific parts of your registry entries such as shared DLL’s, startup invalid entries, even missing fonts, plus a whole lot more.

I’ve manage to find a few different third-party software on the net. I’ve prepared a list of things to look out for when selecting the right software:

A. Look for the feature that allows you to backup and restore your registry when you want.

B. Make sure that it will alert you when a major change is being made to your registry.

C. The most valuable aspect of the software developer is customer service and technical support so make sure they have both.

D. And do not over look this but it needs to be easy to install.
