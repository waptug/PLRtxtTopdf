One can select from a wide variety of desktop art that is available to make your computer look quite spiffy, and not boring and drab like it looked earlier. There is in particularly an essentially limitless supply of desktop wallpaper available on the internet. The fact is, basically any image that you find on the internet can easily be changed into desktop art and posted on your screen to present a decorative touch. It doesn’t matter from where you get the desktop art, or whether it is big or small, free or copyrighted. If it is in the correct graphical format, it can be used as wallpaper for your desktop, easy as can be. On the other hand if it is not in the correct format, there are literally dozens of programs which can do the job of converting it for you.

The screen saver is the most important kind of desktop art. Depending on what type of desktop screen saver that you select, it can be either quite irritating, or a neat distraction. You can even choose to adjust, as in the case of the classical field where you can adjust the number of stars and the speed at which they whiz across your computer screen.

The truth is that, when you are tired and need a break from your work for just a couple of minutes, having an attractive and compelling screen saver to stare off into and daydream can be just do the right trick. And as is the case with a good number of desktop art, there are hundreds and hundreds of screen savers that can be downloaded for free. Don't be a duped and waste your money on desktop art when so many people are just giving it away!

Evidently, the most novel form of desktop art is animation. Desktop animation is essentially little cartoons that go on in the background of your computer while you type. The most prominent example of this type of desktop art that I know of is the one with the wandering sheep that you have perhaps come across at some time. The ones who parachute down and then amble around your screen, doing all sorts of cute things while you work. But, of course there are many other types of desktop art animation for your entertainment, if sheep are not really your thing.

No matter what you enjoy looking at, from robots to swimsuit models, to flying robotic swimsuit models, someone has most likely designed a cute little desktop animation of it for your screen.
