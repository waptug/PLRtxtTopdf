If you have a home theater already, you know the importance of having a good sound system to go along with your home theater.  The sound quality is almost as important if not just as important as the picture quality.  A good sound quality will give you the honest feeling of being in a real theater.  With all of the options for home theater sound systems on the market today, it is likely that you will spend a fair amount of time choosing one that is right for you without breaking the bank.  We will try to take a look at the components of a good sound system, then look at ways to get them at good prices.

While buying a complete system in one box allows you to get a great discount in most cases, buying each component separately allows you to get what you want and allows you to get the best of every component.  Any good audio system will have 3 basic sections of speakers.  The midrange speakers, a set of tweeters, and a subwoofer together make up the surround sound quality that we are all used to in a theater setting.

Home theater speakers come in wired and wireless design.  The wireless are typically more expensive, but have the greatest option for placement.  Check both options if you are able to see which has better sound quality and fits your needs better.  The best speakers have crossover design.  While the driver is important, good crossover can make any driver sound good.  On the other hand, a bad crossover can make a good driver sound bad.  Music playback is a good way to test the waters of a sound system. Most DVDs and television shows do not have great sound quality and fluctuations, but if your home theater system can handle a good CD, then your DVDs should sound great.

Decide on the number of speakers that you think you will need.  Many smaller speakers create good surround sound while larger speakers are good for stereo effects.  Small speakers also work best with a single subwoofer.  The ideal home theater speaker system has five speakers for surround sound.  You may also prefer one surround sound system to another.  Dolby, virtual dolby, and qlogic are just a few of the most common choices.

When you finally decide that it is time to make the big purchase, start by visiting your local electronics store and get an idea of the system capabilities.  Make sure to listen to each system independently to see how they sound in person.  Before you buy anything, comparison shop at other electronics stores in your area.  Then go home and check online.  You may be surprised at the deals you can find online simply because many online retailers do not have the overhead of a storefront and greater number of employees.  There are comparison shopping sites online that offer details about products and their pros and cons so you can shop from the comfort of your easy chair.

Finding a reasonably priced home theater speaker system is actually a lot easier than many people think it will be.  Start out online and you will find that the time you spend researching could save you a lot of money in the long run.
