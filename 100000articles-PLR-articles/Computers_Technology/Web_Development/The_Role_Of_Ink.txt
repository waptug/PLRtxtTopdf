In the list of things that we take for granted in this modern world – in fact, don’t even think about – the existence of ink would surely make the list. How often do we give consideration to that substance to which flows through our pens and our printers; without which neither would exist. There are no pens without ink. There are no newspapers, magazines, cards, or any printed piece without ink. And there are no computer printers without ink.

For those of us who own home computers and, therefore printers with which to accompany them, the thought we give to ink is more pronounced as we labor to stay ahead of ink cartridge replacements.

Working with a computer, and a home printer, means that we’ll be faced with ink replacement on a regular basis. And if we’re not vigilant on this front we’re often faced with a surprise shortage of ink that compromises the success of whatever project in which we are engaged.

Printer ink is housed in an ink cartridge and more often than not consumers will replace the entire cartridge when their ink supply runs out. However, there is an alternative in which you can simply replace the ink within the cartridge thus eliminating unneeded waste and keeping costs to a minimum. There are supply stores that can replace your ink or do-it-yourself kits that allow you to handle it at home. Either way, this can be a responsible and cost-efficient alternative to cartridge replacement.

Keeping ahead of the need for ink does not have to be a challenging endeavor. In many cases, a solid and ongoing relationship with a trustworthy vendor can save you money and aggravation. Vendors can keep track of your order history, the type of ink you generally purchase, and the time between orders. If you align yourself with a reputable vendor they can even establish a standing order in which your ink is shipped on a regular basis without you having to go through the order process each time.

Make the ongoing replacement of your ink part of your printer and computer maintenance. By giving some through to this often overlooked resource, you will save yourself any surprises down the line.
