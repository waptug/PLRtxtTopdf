According to the Specialty Equipment Market Association’s (SEMA) first quarter report for 2007, a recent J.D. Power and Associates report has concluded that while gas-powered engines remain dominant in the U.S. market, hybrids and diesels are steadily gaining market share. It is no secret that rising gas prices and environmental concerns are the two main catalysts pushing consumers toward alternative-fuel vehicles. 
As gas prices rise, diesels seem a natural solution for the United States, especially for manufacturers with large operations in Europe, where diesel cars are already in large demand, said J.D. Power and Associates Automotive Forecasting Manager Kevin Riddell. 
A vehicle with a modern diesel engine will have 30 percent better fuel economy than a comparable gasoline engine. Plus, advances have made modern diesel engines perform similar to gasoline engines in terms of noise, filtration systems and drive quality, said Riddell. While hybrids still only share a relatively small part of the market, they are enjoying phenomenal annual sales growth. Consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental benefits and fuel-savings recognized by driving a hybrid vehicle. Rental fleets, delivery fleets and taxi companies are adding thousands of hybrids to their vehicle pools. AMSOIL provides superior synthetic lubricants for nearly all applications, including hybrid and diesel-powered vehicles. Not only that, but AMSOIL synthetics improve fuel economy and reduce our impact on the environment by extending drain intervals.
