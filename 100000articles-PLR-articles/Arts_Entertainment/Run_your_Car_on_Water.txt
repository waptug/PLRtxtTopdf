Article Body:
<p><b>Today</b>, I just found out that we can convert our Car to Run on Water and gas to save over 40% on fuel costs! <br />
Did you know that you can convert your car to a water-burning car? You can run your car on water, supplemental to gasoline, to increase your car's fuel efficiency and reduce your fuel costs significantly.<br />
<b>This easy conversion</b> guide will show you how to use electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO (2 Hydrogen + 1 Oxygen). HHO, also called Brown's Gas or Hydroxy, burns smoothly and provides significant energy - while the end product is just H2O! HHO provides the atomic power of Hydrogen, while maintaining the stability of water.<br />
<b>Can Water Really Power a Car?</b>The answer is YES, ABSOLUTELY! We have made the technology to build a water-burning hybrid easy and affordable.<br />
<b>Water can be used to fuel a car</b> when used as a supplement to gasoline. In fact, very little water is needed! only one quart of water provides over 1800 gallons of HHO gas which can literally last for months and significantly increase your vehicle's fuel efficiently, improve emissions quality, and save you money.<br />
<b>This do-it-yourself conversion</b> guide is very affordable (under $150) and EASY with step-by-step instructions. The conversion WILL NOT void your warranty because it is 100% reversible! It's easy to install and remove.<br />
<b>Thousands of successful</b> water-conversions around the world are proof that this technology works  and will soon catch on! Some industry insiders say its just a matter of time before this water-burning technology will be standard in new automobiles. One expert estimates most cars will be using this technology by 2012, but until the auto manufacturers catch up, you can use this technology for yourself today at a very reasonable set-up cost.<br />
