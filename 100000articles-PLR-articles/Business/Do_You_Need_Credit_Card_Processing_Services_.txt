Are your customers asking for credit card processing services? If so, you may want to consider adding this service to your company’s Website in order to provide convenient payment methods that will bring back repeat business. Many companies today are moving more toward e-commerce, which means that if you want to avoid getting left behind, you should get ready to join the throng of professionals who are marching into the electronic age of doing business.

Although you may have relied on cash transactions up to now, you might find that is becoming more cumbersome to make correct change, accept checks that could bounce, and track delinquent payments, all while keeping track of each and every transaction. Farming out some of these tasks to hired help can be costly, which is why you may be able to benefit from credit card processing services. If you conduct business onsite at a primary facility, you can plug in a credit card processor and start taking credit payments immediately, which are far less likely to bounce than personal checks.

But you will first have to open a merchant account before establishing credit card processing services. Look for a longstanding bank with a solid reputation, one who currently offers merchant accounts to dependable business owners like you. Then be prepared to provide the required documentation that shows a stable credit history and a reasonable business plan that depends on credit card processing services. Upon approval, which can come within a few days, you will be able to purchase or rent credit card processing equipment and start accepting credit payments from your customers.

Credit card processing services can be established at your company’s Website. You do have a Website, don’t you? If not, that is the second important step into the 21st century that your company needs to take. Hire a Web designer or sketch a few ideas yourself. It need not be fancy or sophisticated, but rather a basic outline of your company’s services or products along with basic operating information. Then you will need to register a domain name for a small fee and then pay monthly “rental” fees to post your site in cyberspace. Hiring a designer or someone to maintain and update your site will cost a little more, although often you can find a high school or college student who can do this type of work at nominal cost. When your site is up and running and your merchant account is approved, you are ready to open the Website doors to current and new customers for business. They can browse at their convenience and pay by credit card without human assistance at each juncture. You can make money and save money at the same time.

If your company is growing, your customers are asking about credit payments, or you want to move forward with your business plan, give some thought to opening a merchant account, setting up an attractive Website, and adding the convenient, customer service option of credit card processing services.
