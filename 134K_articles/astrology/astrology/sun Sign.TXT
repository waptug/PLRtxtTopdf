Sun sign

Your Sun sign represents the sign of the Zodiac that the Sun was in at the time of your birth. The Sun rules willpower and ego. It is the core of who you are and what you are about. 

Your Sun sign represents the main direction and focus you want your life to take and your determination to accomplish what you set out to do. It represents your personal honesty and integrity, your ability to command respect and authority and your capacity to impress and influence others. 

The beginning and end dates for each of the signs can vary from year to year. We suggest you take a look at our cusp page for greater information if you were born on a cusp. People born on the cusp of a sun sign can exhibit characteristics of both signs. 

If the Sun was in the part of the Zodiac called Aries at the time of your birth, then you are an Aries! Your character though similar to one of the twelve zodiac elements, will always be unique as a result of who you are and the choices you make. In fact your character as far as Astrology is concerned requires that the position of all the Planets (the nine planets in our solar system plus the moon and sun) are calculated. Imagine that these planets are the ingredients that can make up a human being, they can all be added in many different permutations and quantities. 

So a professional astrologer takes into account the position of all these planets in your Birth Chart, using only your time, date and place of birth. This greater accuracy focuses on your character, problems, and forecasts your future choices and best most timely solutions.
