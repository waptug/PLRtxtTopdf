Article Body:
People like a "special" price or exclusive offer directed only to them. Most Industrial and Manufacturing equipment buyers are seeking to be told that they are special. 

Through a great deal of trial and error writing advertisements for Industrial and Manufacturing Equipment classifieds, I have learned to employ this technique to each and every classified and auction description I create. 
Most successful online auction and classified listings are based on the element of exclusivity. First and foremost I almost always use a “special deal” offered only thought the channel I am using to market my equipment. It is important to stress that No outsider can participate and that the offer is only available if the buyer responds to the specific equipment listing where the savings or price point is offered. 

Keeping with the same theme "FREE" is becoming an over used term on the web. While offering free shipping, free equipment installation or free support can be a useful technique in driving sales, it’s important not to over use the term. If you choose to use a "Free" offer of some kind it’s important to stress to you potential buyer why receiving the free service or ancillary product is so beneficial.

Remember that selling Industrial Equipment online is no different than selling any other product.  Those of us that endeavor to sell not only the highest quality products, but to understand the buying habits as well as the psychology of our consumers, will succeed where others fail.
