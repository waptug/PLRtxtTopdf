Working with Chocolate

Did you know different types of chocolate require different methods for cooking, and when melting chocolate it is best to use a metal spoon as wooden and plastic spoons retain moisture that will cause the chocolate to seize?

Many dessert recipes will require you to melt chocolate in a double boiler. This is really easy to set up. All you need is a glass bowl big enough to hold the chocolate and at the same time fit into the top of a sauce pan without touching the bottom. In the sauce pan you simply boil water and then place the bowl of chocolate pieces on the top of the pan, stirring constantly until the chocolate is smooth.

Fresh fruit can be a perfect and light ending to any meal. You can give it that little something extra and have melted chocolate on the table to dip the fruit into. Satisfy everyone’s taste buds.
