Article Body:
The Car Care Council is dedicating an entire month to reminding drivers of the importance of being "car care aware." National Car Care Month, a nationwide effort to focus motorists' attention on the essentials of vehicle care and maintenance, will take place in April.

During National Car Care Month, many repair facilities and auto parts stores join local businesses, civic groups, radio stations and others to sponsor free vehicle checkups. The events are held in parking lots at shopping malls, schools, businesses and other highly visible locations.

"The industry has embraced April as an ideal time of year to conduct National Car Care Month activities," said Rich White, executive director of the Car Care Council. "In April 2005, we plan on conducting more comprehensive vehicle checkup events and promotions that will provide consumers with more information about preventive vehicle maintenance."

Nationwide results from last year's checkups underscore the continuing need for vehicle maintenance education. The results showed that 87 percent of all vehicles needed repair or maintenance; 34 percent had low or dirty engine oil; 27 percent had inadequate cooling protection; 25 percent needed new belts; 24 percent had dirty air filters; and 26 percent had low or contaminated brake fluid.

The Car Care Council is the source of information for the "Be Car Care Aware" campaign, educating consumers about the benefits of regular vehicle care, maintenance and repair.
