Obstacle Courses

This summer activity can be played in the park, the beach, or in your backyard.  You can 
use props, actions or a combination of both.  When you set-up an obstacle course it 
doesn’t even have to be for a bunch of kids, one person can play this game too.

In your backyard set up stations and have the child or each child move from station to 
station in a different manner.  The can somersault to one, run backwards to the next, and 
skip to the last one.  Other methods of locomotion could include walking like a crab, 
crawling on all fours, walking sideways, hopping on one foot, or any other sill movement 
that can be thought of.  Using this method is also a tricky way to get kids to move along 
when you are out for a walk with them.  Pick a marker not too far in the distance and 
have them do a silly move to get to it first. 

When out at the park, use the play equipment to set-up an obstacle course for the kids.  
They may have to zigzag through the swings, go down the slide and then touch a tree to 
win.  Involve the kids and ask them what they think should be involved in the obstacle 
course or race.

Equipment that can be used to make the course more challenging are jump ropes, safety 
cones, different size balls, and other sporting equipment.  An obstacle course is anything 
that makes it trickier to get from point A to point B.  You can add in a task for older kids 
to develop special skills like knot tying or balancing – have them balance on one foot on 
top of a log to the count of 15.  If they fall off they have to start all over again.
