Online greeting cards send a cheerful & speedy message

Greeting cards are the traditional way to send personal messages to wish your friends or family members well, remember their birthday or communicate holiday greetings. The traditional greeting cards can be expensive, they require postage for delivery and you've got to mail the card several days in advance to ensure timely delivery.

Today, the new wave in cards is online greeting cards. You'll find a selection of thousands of cards in every category and theme you can imagine. Unlike paper greeting cards, online cards require no postage and are delivered in minutes. You can even specify a future date for delivery, if you're one of those people who think ahead! You can also ask for notification when your card has been delivered. From choosing to sending, your entire transaction is done electronically, online. How easy can it be?

Another advantage to sending online greeting cards is that you can compose your own personal message on a blank card, or add whatever else you like to the poem or message already in the card. Most often, you have the opportunity to choose background and font colors for your card, so online greeting cards can be customized with your recipient's favorite colors.

Animation and sound are other cool options available with online greeting cards. These are so much fun, you can spend quite a bit of time just browsing the selections. You may have difficulty choosing just one! You may also find yourself thinking of online cards to send just to say hello, when ordinarily you wouldn't take the time to go to the card shop for a hello card.

There are thousands of sites offering online greeting cards. When this service was in its infancy, all the cards were free. As people caught on to this terrific new trend in sending their greeting cards electronically, one thing led to another and soon these cards were so popular, online greeting card sites were busy around the clock with customers. The card sites enlarged their selection of cards, with each category ever more full of cool choices.

Today, most online greeting card sites have two sections, one with free cards and another, with some of the choicest cards available for a nominal fee, still at bargain prices when compared with the cost of a paper card.

The decorative options of electronic greeting cards, with cute and funny animations, along with the convenience and speed of delivery makes these cards a very attractive choice. Just go online and check out some of the quality offerings in these new types of greetings. At the very least, you'll have fun browsing and most likely, you'll end up sending two or three. They're irresistible! Go see for yourself!
