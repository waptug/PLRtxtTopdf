Graphic designers consider the adobe photoshop as a very important tool in their trade.  The program offers a lot of help in creating special effects and in manipulating photos and other designs.  This program is virtually a must-have for every web designer who wants to be the best in his trade.

The more advanced designers however desire a more upbeat program that can be easily manipulated by designers and with additional features.  The good news for graphic designers is the introduction of the new Photoshop CS2 program which is a very welcome improvement of the old adobe photoshop program.

There are a lot of things that a designer can only wish for in the old adobe photoshop program and which are now available in the CS2 photoshop program. Those who already know adobe photoshop like the back of their hands can just dive in and use the program with a little adjustment.

However those who have not yet fully mastered adobe photoshop or who are still learning adobe photoshop can look at the CS2 photoshop in an entirely new manner.  Just like the adobe photoshop program the CS2 photoshop program can be easily learned.

Anybody interested in learning the CS2 program can get hold of the CS2 free photoshop tutorial.  These tutorials can be downloaded from some Internet sites for free and a person only need to invest some time to give some information to the webmaster and the tutorial will be sent to him.

Getting a free CS2 photoshop tutorial is as easy as downloading photos from the Internet.  There is no reason why a person interested in learning new layout and design techniques could not gain access to CS2 photoshop.  Any designer can just upgrade his old design program and shift to the CS2 photoshop program which promises more effects and techniques as well as easy manipulation.

Photo enhancement is now more possible with CS2 photoshop.  A designer can easily correct photo imperfections using the spot healing brush tool of CS2 photoshop without getting a source first unlike the old version.

One of the major problems faced by photographers is the red eye effect.  Nobody wants to look like the devil incarnate so most photographs get buried in the computer because of the red eye. With CS2 photoshop a person can easily get rid of the red eye effect with just one click of the mouse.

While the old photoshop program allowed a designer to enlarge objects in photographs, it however gets pixelized and no longer worth looking at.  With the upgraded program, this can be done without destroying the overall look of the object. 

One problem experienced by beginners in the old photoshop versions is the seeming uselessness of the help tool because it does not really help the user.  With the new CS2 photoshop the help button gets to be really helpful to the beginner.

Getting and learning a new design program like photoshop used to be difficult.  One has to pay for it and the program can take sometime to reach the market.  But things are looking up thanks to the Internet. 

The new CS2 Photoshop can be downloaded for free and in a matter of minutes a person can already start tweaking and experimenting on his newfound design companion.
