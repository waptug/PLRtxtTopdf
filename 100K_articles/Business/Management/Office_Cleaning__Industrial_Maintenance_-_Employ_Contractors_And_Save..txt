Who cleans your offices? Who is wandering around your private spaces with possible sight of your confidential documents? Most companies employ cleaning staff directly. Supervision of these cleaners can be a time-consuming management task. This is the main reason that an increasing number of companies are choosing to employ specialist, cleaning contractors to maintain their office environment.

You will find many companies that specialize in cleaning offices. These companies may employ personnel who have security clearances and have been trained in using heavy duty carpet vacuuming and cleaning systems. Commercial cleaning systems can achieve far higher dust removal and hygiene standards than those generally available in retail outlets.

Industrial cleaning contractors who specialize in cleaning equipment and plant are fewer in number. There are a few national companies and you will also find local businesses that specialize in this area.

If a company is carrying food in tankers, flour, for example, the tankers will need to be cleaned by specialist and certified companies. Road tankers and storage tanks for chemicals and oil products need to be cleaned to ensure the integrity of the manufacturing process. Only a company specializing in tank cleaning will have the special equipment and certification that are necessary.

Another specialist area is in the removal of lime-scale from the heating elements of boilers and hot water systems. If these are not cleaned regularly there will be significantly increased running costs to bear. Again these are specialist jobs, requiring specialist chemicals and personnel trained in their use.

It is not a good use of capital for any company to train and retain its own maintenance department, when there are external contractors who will do the job for a fair price. The contractor can offer a low quote for a job because their equipment and personnel are kept busy and you will not be paying the costs associated with under use of resources.
