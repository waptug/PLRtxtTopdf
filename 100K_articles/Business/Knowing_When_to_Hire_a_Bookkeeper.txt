Do you love the thought of handling the financial books for your business? For most of us, unless you do bookkeeping for a living, the answer to that question is probably no.

How much time does it take you on either a daily or weekly basis to handle this task? If you are finding it is taking too much time away from what your focus should be, it may be time to consider hiring someone to help.

Here are a few signs that it may be time to hire a bookkeeper:

1) You loathe the thought of even opening your financial software program.

2) You find yourself in the office way past your normal working hours tackling bookkeeping issues.

3) Your frustration level grows higher each time you work on your books.

4) At tax time you stumble to get your paperwork together for your accountant or CPA.

Sometimes it's better to free up your time for those things that are more important to you and to the success of your business. Listen to your inner wisdom, and if/when the time is right and your budget will allow, hire someone to take off the pressure. Your peace of mind will be well worth it.
