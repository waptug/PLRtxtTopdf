Free online surveys that pay have become more and more popular. The promise to pay actual money for what most people do in their spare time is hardly anything new, but the prospect that it actually could happen to you tends to surprise a lot of people.

The reality is that there are, indeed, free online surveys that pay. Consumers are looking for the opportunity to share their insight with major corporations and major corporations want consumer input into their products as it assists with marketing and product design. There is no point in designing a fish-flavored cough syrup in plastic bags if nobody is going to by it. That type of critical business error can end up costing millions, so giving a way a few dollars or a free bicycle can actually save corporate money.

Where do I sign up?

Free online surveys that pay are available almost anywhere online, but in the midst of the free opportunities lie opportunities that aren't so fantastic. They offer a list of “free surveys” that you can take, but end up charging a fee for access to the list. The truth is that the lists of company's are available everywhere because the company that is interested in consumer opinion ends up making that information available for free. The “list companies” are simply in the middle trying to turn a profit.

Several sites have discussion forums in which you can find all sorts of tales from construction workers that gave up their jobs to do surveys on handbags to stay-at-home moms that add income to the family by clicking away about their favorite deli meats. These sites are also great ways to encounter stories of some of the more questionable paid survey opportunities.

What about my children?
There are free online surveys that pay available for anyone in the family as long as a responsible adult is around to monitor the internet usage. Many companies are as interested in the opinions of children as they are adults, and as hard as it may be to believe: children are among the most frequent consumers of products like TV dinners and popsicles. Businesses pay millions of dollars for this type of seemingly “obvious” information.

All in all, an important principle to remember is to be careful with your information. Giving away your time is one thing; giving away your credit card number is quite another. Make sure that is you use your credit card, that it is a secure site. There are many secure payment sites such as paypal and clickbank.
