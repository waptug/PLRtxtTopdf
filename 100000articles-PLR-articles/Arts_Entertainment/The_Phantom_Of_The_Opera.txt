The Apparition of the Opera house (1986) is one of the about popular musicals of the late-twentieth hundred. Andrew Harold Lloyd Webber's haunting musical theater sexual conquest includes such classic melodious theatre songs as "Remember of Me," "The Phantasm of the ," and "Medicine of the Nox." More than a decade after its premiere, the melodic continued to play to sellout audiences in both Greater London and New York. Similarly, numerous other productions also played to packed houses worldwide. Possibly Harold Clayton Lloyd Webber's just about celebrated employment, The Phantasma of the open at Her Majesty's Theatre in British capital (the edifice of which strongly resembles the City of Light Theater) in 1986. 

Charles Hart was the lyricist, and additional lyrics were provided by Richard Stilgoe. Webber and Stilgoe based their libretto on Gaston Leroux's 1911 refreshing and cast Michael Crawford as the mysterious Shadow, Sarah Brightman as the opera house singer Christine Daae, and Steve Barton as Raoul, Christine's suitor. The three singers recreated their roles once the on Broadway in 1988. Hal Prince's imaginative and impressive staging captivated audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. 

The familiar fib of the disfigured, masked Specter World Health Organization lives in the lake below the French capital Theatre and is obsessed with the beautiful young soprano Christine Daae and takes her from refrain girl to diva is told in an intensely romantic and operatic stylus. The Spectre teaches Christine to sing and secures for her the lead role in his , Don Juan Triumphant, by terrorizing all WHO would stand in his way, including Raoul, Christine's true love. At the remainder, the kidnaps Christine and she kisses him without being repulsed by his physical appearance, he disappears and leaves her to be with Raoul. Among the appearance's almost inspired songs ar "Retrieve of Me," "The of the ," "Angel of Euphony," "Wholly I Require of You," "The of the Nighttime," "Masquerade," "Prima Donna," "Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again," and "The Point of No Return." The euphony is decidedly operatic in dash, as befits the story. Rock elements permeate much of the mark, whether in a hard elan as in the title figure or in a gentler vein as in "Entirely I Expect of You." Webber recreated the atmosphere of nineteenth-100 operatic Capital of France and made it accessible to audiences of the twentieth C. 

Spectacular ocular personal effects fill the display, as in the climatic remnant of the first base human action the chandelier rises above the during the overture alone(p) to be cut down by the and plummets to the stage. Other lasting images like the grand staircase filled with Greek chorus members and mannequins in the "Masqerade" identification number at the beginning of the second base human activity and the ghostly candelabra on the 's lake prove that, in , the optic is equal to the aural. The of the is representative of two dominant trends in the of the 1980s and 1990s: the sung-through and the mega-. The former type is a in which spoken dialogue is minimalized and generally replaced by operatic recitative (speech-singing). The irregular descriptor refers to a prove in which sets, costumes, and special as important to the dramatic narrative as the traditional coupling of and words. Every aspect of the oeuvre is meant to dazzle the . 

Webber's is not the merely adaptation of Leroux's fresh. No less than five film versions of have been produced. Perchance the all but famed is the first gear, Lon Chaney's 1925 silent classic. Other house reworkings of the story include those by Ken Hill (1984) and Mary Yeston (1990).
