However, since the HP pavilion line of products has expanded considerably over the years, there are now a variety of choices when it comes to this line of products. To make sure that you get the right type of HP pavilion, here are some pointers for you to consider.

If you are busy person who love to multi-task, it would be better for you to get a computer that will allow you to open spreadsheets, documents and presentation materials while letting you play your favorite music. On the other hand, if you belong the super bust category of people who cannot spare time to wait for their computers to shift from one task to another, get something that will allow you to perform several task at the same time such as opening spreadsheets and database, doing complex graphics, internet browsing, entertainment applications and others.

Portability of the Computer

Since most of us are always on the go nowadays, you will need a computer that will allow you maximum flexibility of movements. If you are one of those people who frequently travel, HP pavilion notebook PCs that weigh not more 4.5 lbs would be idea for you. Since these types of computers are small and lightweight, they usually come with small monitors. On the other hand, if you do not really move around much or if you expect to travel only short distance, HP pavilion notebook PCs that weigh around 4.0 to 6.0 lbs will do nicely. The good news about these types of laptops is that they usually have bigger monitors and will allow you better viewing compared to the smaller computers.
