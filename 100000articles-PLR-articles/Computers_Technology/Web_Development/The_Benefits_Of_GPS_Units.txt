GPS Units have many benefits. It does not matter whether you are purchasing a handheld GPS Unit for hiking, biking, or another outdoor activity or you are purchasing a portable GPS Unit for driving directions, business purposes, or emergencies. Your GPS Unit is quite capable of performing high technological feats for being presented in such a small package.

That is why you should know exactly what the benefits are, before you purchase any type of GPS Unit. GPS devices are not for everyone. However, most people can find at least one benefit. Besides, they are attractive, sleek, and can offer many other services besides mapping locations.

Your GPS Unit is a must have device in any Emergency - While it is excellent that GPS technology is used in cell phones (all cell phones are required to emit GPS tracking signals), some areas are not capable of receiving any type of cell phone or GPS signal because they are out of range. If you know you are going to be in an unfamiliar area, even if you do not have GPS signal access, you should be able to access stored data on your handheld or portable GPS Unit.

You can save maps of the area, different routes you can take, and an overview of the entire region in hopes of preventing you from getting lost. Of course, it is always wise to have a handheld map available as well in these situations.

If you have access to GPS signals, not only can you communicate your location with authorities through your cell phone, you also have the ability to map the location and potentially find your way out of a dangerous situation by getting directions to the closest town.
