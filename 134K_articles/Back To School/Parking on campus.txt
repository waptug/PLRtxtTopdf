Parking on campus

	Large campuses come with lots of problems.  When it takes 10 minutes to drive to school and 20 minutes to find a parking space, it might be time to make some adjustments.  Scoping out a parking spot can be very frustrating.  Who has the time to sit and wait for someone to get out of class, and then follow behind them in your car until you find their parking spot?  We can look at a parking lot and wish for more space, but even if the plans are underway at the school, we will probably be long gone before it is ever built.  Here are some ways to get around the parking problem.
	Find alternate transportation.  Many schools offer free or reduced bus fare for students.  Your commute will be longer, but you don’t have to stress about finding a parking spot, and you can use the extra time to work on homework.
	Ride a bike.  If you don’t live that far away, you might want to consider riding your bike to campus.  Find out if the buildings on campus have bike racks where you can lock up your bike.  You can ride to each class, saving on walking time, and avoid the parking hassle.  If you live in an area with good weather, you might be able to do this year round.
	Find someone to share the commute with.  Although you’ll have to take your turn driving and parking, it will be great on the days when it is someone else’s turn.  You can also see what alternatives are available at the college where you attend.  They might have other suggestions available, such as shuttle buses that take you to campus from a parking lot farther away.  Watch for other ways that you can save on your commute and avoid the parking lot hassles.
