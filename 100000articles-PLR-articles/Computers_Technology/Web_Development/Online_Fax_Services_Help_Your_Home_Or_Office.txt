Fax machines have always been central to serious communication. There really isn't a faster way to get your documents where they need to go. Unfortunately, using a fax machine is not an easy process. Anyone who has ever used one in the past should know about the annoyance of constantly loading new paper, switching in new toner cartridges, and of course the pain of randomly hitting it when all else fails.

Until now you've just had to put up with all of these frustrations and inconveniences if you wanted to stay in touch with your business or family contacts. There is a new option available that will let you send full fax messages through your existing internet connection.

The technology is really pretty simple. It is effectively your current email technology, but kicked up a notch. The user just has to sign up for one of the many available online fax services. There is a wide range of providers offering a number of plans that will cover the needs of just about anyone. Once you sign up for a plan you will receive an online platform for sending and receiving faxes.

If you want to send a fax you just jump onto any computer with an internet connection and log onto the fax server. You just select your file and it will be converted into a PDF or a TIFF file and arrive at its intended address almost immediately. An online fax service will still work if your receivers haven't upgraded.

Each service is able to send the same file to an old-fashioned fax machine and have it printed out in the exact same way as if you would have faxed it through a machine. On the other hand, your service can also receive standard fax files sent to your provided fax number and keep them in a digital format until you get around to seeing them.

Now you understand the technology. So let us review how this can help you or your business. An online fax service has a lot of advantages over a traditional fax machine. You can send out and receive multiple faxes all at the same time, since you are simply exchanging digital files across the internet. This also gives you a little more privacy since you don't have to worry about prying eyes on either side of the transmission.

Expenses should go down or at least stay the same. You will no longer need to pay for a dedicated fax line to have steady service, so the fee for your online provider will be negligible. There should also be considerably lower amounts of ink and paper being used, as unimportant faxes can be kept in a digital format and simply pulled up on the computer when they are needed.

Finally, this entire process can be done from anywhere. You can send out a fax while you're half way around the world, as long as you have a wireless capable laptop and five minutes to duck into a hotspot zone.

The savvy businessman on the go should see this as a great option. These are just some of the benefits that come from your choice to use an online fax service in your home or office.
