The United States knew the Volvo 850 as a 1993 model. However, if one looked further back into the history of this vehicle, he would come to know that the rest of the world was introduced to this vehicle as a 1992 model which was a year older than in the US. The Volvo 850 was the very first vehicle model in the US to feature a front wheel drive system as well as an all aluminum engine with twenty valves and five cylinders.

All the Volvo 850s sold in the United States hold standard equipment and features that include dual front airbags, anti lock brakes, head restraints, three-point seat belts for all passengers, power windows, power door locks, power mirrors, a cruise control system, and a dual zone climate control. The world’s first vehicle to introduce side torso airbags is the Volvo 850. This milestone breaking happened in 1995 when this safety feature was given as an option. Now aside from this feature, other options were added in and offered. The list includes traction control, a leather interior, a power glass moonroof, power seats, heated seats, a remote keyless entry system, an automatic climate control, and an automatic transmission.
