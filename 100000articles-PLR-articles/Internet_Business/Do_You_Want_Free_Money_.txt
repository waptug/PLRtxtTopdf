It probably did not take you more than a second to answer that question—YES! We all want free money, don’t we? But how can we get free money?

Well, if you are looking for free money to use for college and university tuition and fees, you are more likely to find it than those of us who are just looking for free money. Check out websites and programs such as FAFSA and GovernmentGrants.com to find free grant money. You can also check out websites and programs such as FreeCollegeScholarships.net, FastWeb.com, and FedMoney.org that offer free money in the form of scholarships. The great thing about these options is that you are almost guaranteed to get some amount, even if it is not as high as you would like, of free money to use towards your college or university tuition and fees. All you have to do is fill out an application, maybe write an essay or two, and wait.

Now, for the rest of us, free money likely does not exist. There are programs, however, that claim to give you free opportunities to make money such as reading emails or advertisements, taking surveys, downloading a certain tool bar onto your browser, etc. For websites and programs like that check out CashFiesta.com, FreeCenter.com, and AbsolutelyFreebies.com. However, some websites like these require that you pay a registration or startup fee (low, albeit, but still, that is not free, is it?) or fill out all kinds of applications such as for credit cards which can lead to unwanted credit cards, spam in your email, junk in your snail mail, and all kinds of other inconveniences. 

So, for those of us not trying to find free money to use for college and university tuition and fees, finding free money is going to be a little more difficult.
