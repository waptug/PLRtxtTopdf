How to let go

      I have a kindergartener starting school tomorrow.  He is my little boy, my handsome little boy.  I’m having anxiety.  He’s not my first child to start kindergarten but he is most definitely my most stubborn.  I worry about him.  So how do we learn to let go and allow our children the opportunity to grow and develop?
      I’m going to try to take my own advice.  Children need to reach a point where their self-confidence begins to blossom, and they can’t do that while we hold on in the shadows and watch their every move, waiting to see if they need us.  We have to reach a point where we are willing to trust in our child and allow them to stretch their own wings and see how far they can go alone.  It doesn’t mean that we aren’t there when they need us, but we must decide that we have done our best with our children and give them the opportunity to excel.
      Walk away.  I remember seeing other parents when I took my older children on their first day of school.  These parents didn’t leave.  They took their child into the classroom and then stood back to watch.  It was as if they were waiting for their child to need them so they could reassure themselves that the need still exists.  So, walk away.
      Trust in the teacher.  I’m playing the “what if” game with myself today.  What if he gets lost?  What if he doesn’t remember where to go?  What if?  Trust in the teacher – they went to school to learn how to be a kindergarten teacher.  They have done this before.  They are as smart as you.  They are probably a parent.  So tomorrow, I will walk away and trust.  This will be my mantra.
