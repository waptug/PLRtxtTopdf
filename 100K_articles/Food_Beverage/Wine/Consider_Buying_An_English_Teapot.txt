Of all available teapots, perhaps English teapots are one of the most elegant styles. The teapots made of bone china are typically floral and have a dainty, fragile look that make you feel like royalty when you touch them. With care, they will last for many lifetimes and serve many guests.

Bone china is not your only option, however. Now English teapots are made from a variety of different substances. If you think that English teapots are an extravagance, you’ll be pleased to know that the price range varies according to your selection. Plus, besides serving tea from them, think of the other possibilities for using them.

Consider giving an English teapot whenever you need a gift for a friend or relative. You could start a collection of service for them and continue adding to their existing collection whenever you need to give them another gift. They’ll be appreciative and you can make life simpler for yourself as well by not having to spend your time shopping for a gift.

Even better is to start your own collection. Of course you will probably want to add the matching cups and saucers. Imagine your collection in a china cabinet illuminated by a soft, glowing light. Won’t your friends enjoy admiring them? When your friends or relatives ask what you want for a gift for your birthday or a holiday, you could ask for a teapot or additional pieces to your own set. Later, when you’re ready, you could consider giving your pieces to someone special as an heirloom.

If you’re worried about breaking a piece, you can usually buy or find a replacement through replacement services and websites, so don’t worry about replacements.  Instead, think of your tea parties. Picture a table set with your gorgeous English teapot and matching cups, saucers, creamer, and sugar bowl. Imagine your guests commenting on your exquisite pattern and questioning its origin. See yourself explaining how you received the set and how much you love it.

What’s left to do? Take action and find the set you want. Your biggest challenge will be deciding among the beautiful selections. Take your time. Choosing the exact style, color, and pattern you like is part of the fun. If you have trouble deciding and if your budget allows, you may want to order several teapots or sets for yourself. The more sets you have, the more guests you can invite to your tea parties.

Once you do make a selection, you’ll have pieces you’ll cherish forever. Remember - don’t just look at your teapots. Use them. You now have a wonderful reason to have more company so that you can share your valued set.

You deserve to treat yourself and teapots are one of the best ways to do so. When is the best time to treat yourself? Without a doubt, the best time to treat yourself is always right now!
