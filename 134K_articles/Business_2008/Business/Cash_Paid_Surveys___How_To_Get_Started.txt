Some sites will offer you direct access to the marketing companies who process the surveys. In this case you will have to browse the database and apply for the surveys you are interested in, other sites act as “the middle man” - thy have agreements with big marketing companies from which they receive the surveys and then distribute them through their registered users. In this case, you will have to passively wait for surveys to complete.

Also, bear in mind that not all paid surveys are actually cash paid surveys… Some surveys do not offer money as a reward for completing them. Instead, you might receive a free product or a service; discounts at certain merchants, vouchers or coupons, free trials, etc. there are even surveys that allow you to join a competition upon their completion. If you are not really after these kinds of remunerations, it's better to make this decision yourself in advance to avoid disappointment later.

Another important thing to consider is how you will get the cash and who is paying. If you have joined a mediator type of site, you are usually paid by that site, not the one you are doing the end survey for. If you have joined a database of companies seeking survey participants you are likely to be paid by the surveying company. Regardless of the details you should be aware of the payment method - are you going to be paid by check or by bank transfer etc.
