It may seem like a fairly unimportant question, but have you ever thought about why men love leather mini skirts so much? Of course, there is the obvious answer that has something to do with the actual amount of a woman’s body that is left showing by a mini skirt verses the amount of the body that is left up to the man’s imagination. Or it could be because of a fantasy that has previously established itself deep in the mind of a particular man. Or it could be because of the prehistoric notion of leather and some ingrained instinct that draws a man to the supple, smooth surface. But whatever the reason is why men go wild over mini skirts, they are a definite hit!

Mini skirts have been around for years, and they never quite seem to go out of style. Of course, there are different arenas when a mini skirt is probably inappropriate, generally in any work place or public areas where your mini skirt is little more than a band of fabric that covers one the bare minimum. However, if you are looking to catch a man’s eye—including the eye of your husband or boyfriend, consider donning a teeny tiny mini skirt and watch their mouths drop. 

The great thing about using leather as a material to construct your mini skirt is because of the tremendous molding properties of leather. Often, skirts can be difficult to fit (especially in the rear with short skirts), since everyone is of a different proportion. For this reason, leather works fantastically as the natural material is highly elastic and forms to your shape like a second skin. You do not have to worry about unsightly gaps or awkward fitting with a leather mini skirt, but you will get plenty of practice shimmying and shaking for your man when you put on your mini skirt!

Leather is an incredibly stylish material and is available in a wide variety of colors, but perhaps basic black makes the biggest impact. Especially when constructed into a mini skirt, leather has a fantastic sheen and depth so that the piece of clothing looks far more expensive and unique than a typical skirt made of some type of cloth. Furthermore, leather is compatible with a variety of other materials, including other leather, so matching a top to your leather mini skirt in order to complete your outfit will be a breeze. Consider a saucy and seductive leather halter to top off your mini skirt or opt for a flowing top to avoid leather overload.

Even if you would never wear leather mini skirts out of your home, every woman should own at least one to wear in the bedroom. What better way to spark your husband’s interest that doing your chores around the house in a tight fitting, sexy leather mini skirt? This is a great way to weasel your way out of completing certain tasks or enticing your husband to finish his honey-do list. Imagine how dedicated your husband would be to housework if you would be working by his side in a skimpy skirt?

The shortest of the short leather mini skirts are fantastic substitutions for traditional lingerie. Why worry with thongs, g-strings, or any other type of underwear when your skirt is so short that it wouldn’t hide even the tiniest pair of panties? Top a mouthwatering leather mini skirt with a tiny bra top that can be removed by simply untying the strings and watch your man start to pant and drool! This outfit will definitely benefit both parties in any relationship, and after all, aren’t relationships about give and take?
