First of all, there are a lot of people who have no
formal book keeping training or people who don't have
a degree in accountancy who became successful in book
keeping as their online business. Today, you have to
consider the fact that many business owners do their
own book keeping at home for their annual tax returns.

You first need to know and apply taxation rules and
other factors. Keeping a clear record of income and
expenses of a business that you do book keeping for is
also important. Although book keeping for others as
your small online business can earn you some cash, you

full-blown career you will want to study about book
keeping first in order to become qualified as a book
keeper.

So, here are some of the things that you should know
about book keeping.

First, you have to remember that every type of
business whether it is large or small is required by
law to keep books where everything financial are
recorded. What this means is that all the financial
transactions of the business should be recorded. All
these things can be done manually through ledgers.
However, it can also be done with the help of a
computer by using spreadsheets or a dedicated software
for book keeping.

Most business owners who rely on manual book keeping
will tend to keep invoices, receipts, utility bills
and other scraps of paper that affected their business
financially in a shoe box. When tax time comes, the
box is handed over to the book keeper, such as you,
and should be able to transform the mess in the shoe
box in a formal looking record of the financial
dealings of the business.

Book keeping as a career is a rewarding one. Whether
you want to do it as part time work or a full time
career, you will see that anyone can become a book
keeper and work from home as a freelancer. In fact,
you can even set up a website where you will offer
your book keeping services and start an online book
keeping service.

Book keeping is a great career that can open up a lot
of opportunities for you. In fact, a book keeping
professional qualification can be the first step to
become a qualified accountant and open up a lot of
well-paid career opportunities.

If you want to become a book keeper, it helps if you
take book keeping classes. Today, most local colleges
have book keeping classes available. Some also offers
distance learning programs where you can learn how to
become a book keeper right at your own home.
