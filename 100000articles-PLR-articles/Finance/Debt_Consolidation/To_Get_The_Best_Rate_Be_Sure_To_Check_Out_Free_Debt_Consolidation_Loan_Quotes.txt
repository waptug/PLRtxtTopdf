Getting into debt is fun isn’t it? You get to buy all those cool clothes, take your friends out to dinner, do anything you want, after all you’re just going to “put it on your card” -- Spending money is fun and paying with a credit card to just too easy, so easy that before you know it, you’ve buried yourself under a mountain of debt.

Once you’ve fallen into the trap of credit card debt, it’s very difficult to get out. Taking out a debt consolidation loan is sometimes the best way to eliminate the burden.

There are a few ways that you can get a loan to consolidate your credit card bills but in my opinion the best way is to gather some free debt consolidation loan quotes. There are a number of agencies that will do some of the work for you and help you find the best loan for you.

The fastest way to get out of debt is to pay off your existing debt with the lowest interest rate. A debt consolidation loan is the best solution for this. A few minutes of online research will reveal a number of agencies that will give you a free debt consolidation loan quote. Be sure to take all your quotes and compare them side by side to get the best rate and terms. The time you spend researching will be well spent because it can save you thousands of dollars.

So what do you want to look for when making your comparison? The first thing is the most obvious; you want to make sure you are getting the lowest interest rate. This rate should be lower than the rate that you are currently paying for your credit cards as this will accelerate the pace that you’ll be able to pay off the debt.

The other detail that some people over look is weather the loan is secured or unsecured. Make sure that you are getting a loan that is unsecured. If you have to put your home or automobile up as collateral for your loan, you now have the added stress of worrying about losing your property in addition to paying off the loan. Unsecured loans will generally be at a higher interest than an unsecured one but the lower stress levels may make it worthwhile.

Many consolidation loan companies offer online quote applications. You can apply to a number of agencies and then select the best quote. You can apply for a quote on the telephone or they may send you an application for you to fill out and then send it back through the mail or fax. There are also companies that will offer an application online and give you an answer in just a few minutes.
