* Halloween: Nightly ghost and vampire tours are offered throughout the year, but they take on new meaning during Halloween in New Orleans, dubbed "The Most Haunted City in America." "Boo at the Zoo" at Audubon Zoo and "Ghosts in the Oaks" at City Park are perfect kid-friendly celebrations for your tykes.
