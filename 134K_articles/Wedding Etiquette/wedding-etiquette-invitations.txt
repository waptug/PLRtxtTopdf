Wedding Etiquette: Invitations<br><br>

Some couples think that wedding invitations are not that important. They think that a wedding invitation it is just a piece of paper that they give out to their wedding guest which will be forgotten afterwards.<br><br>

This is wrong. In fact there is a wedding etiquette even on invitations. This is because wedding invitations give your guests a preview on how your wedding will be celebrated. They will know through wedding invitations what they would wear so they would not commit a violation in wedding etiquette for clothing and dress, and they would know how formal or informal the event may be so they wold know what to expect in the wedding reception.<br><br>

Also, well made wedding invitations will give a lasting impression on your wedding. Your guests will remember you even through your just your wedding invitation.<br><br>

(centered)<br><br>
Mr. and Mrs. John Bates<br><br>
request the honour of your presence<br><br>
at the marriage of their daughter<br><br>
Rachel Anne Bates<br><br>
to<br><br>
Mr. Matthew James Phoenix<br><br>
son of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Phoenix<br><br>
...<br><br>

You can replace the wordings of the above example and apply your own wordings most especially if it is the couples who will do the inviting.

When to send invitations? <br><br>

Wedding etiquette on sending out of invitations must be done four to six weeks before the wedding day. But for couples who prepare their wedding one or two years ahead. Then can send out a save a date invititation since many things will be changed along the way. This is also true for couples who want a wedding with wedding destination theme. Wedding etiquette makes it clear that invitations must be sent out earlier than four to six weeks, in fact even six months ahead, so that the guests can make their own hotel reservations ahead of time<br><br>

But remember, the save a date card is not yet the proper invitation. It is a violation of wedding etiquette to replace a proper wedding invitation with a save a date card. Save a date card just serve as an initial announment about your upcoming wedding. You should give your guests the courtesy to inform them of the exact venue of wedding celebration and reception, the attire and the date and time.<br><br>
