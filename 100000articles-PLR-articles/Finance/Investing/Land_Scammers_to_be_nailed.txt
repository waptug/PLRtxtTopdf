The UK Parliament seems convinced about Greg Mulholland's arguments that the scammers are trying hard to sell the greenfield lands in Sussex Farmland and Groombridge Land. Both these places are a heaven for scammers as they present natural environment and a feeling of being with nature to the visitor.
 
Mulholland, the Liberal Democrat, argued that the land banking companies are trying hard to get a pie out of the sale of investment land and that the Government and the Ministers will agree to work with him on this issue. The MP for Leeds, North West also commented on the full investment process through which the investor goes and the company makes money.
 
The MP told the Parliament as to how the Government reacted to one of the Land Scams being conducted in Victoria, Australia. The government body barred the said company for any promotional and marketing activities until full hearing of the case has been done. But no such decisive action has taken place in the UK.
 
The MP said that a company contacted him for this matter and put its concern over the growing number of fly-by-night land banking companies. Mr. Mulholland concluded that a governing body to rule out the possible scams has to be devised.
 
The measure suggested by Mr. Mulholland can successfully prevent the scamsters to sell the land of Groombridge Land and Sussex Farmland.
