Article Body:
There are many ways to get your audience involved in your presentation. Some are audience participation, stories, jokes, silly stunts, or songs. All of these work well, but they won't work if you are a dud!

Listen to these words: Sparkle, lighten up, silly - What do they mean to you?

Some days when you are doing a presentation you sometimes don't feel like being there or even being around people!
This normal, but everyone can spot it when you aren't all there.

NOTE#### You have about five seconds to grab your audience's attention before they go nuts on you!

There are four areas you need to work on to insure that "Pizzazz" takes place.

1. Your introduction: Do you know how to introduce yourself? Do you have a good handshake? Do you smile and look people in the eye? How do you look? Clean? A slob? Wrinkled?

2. Your surroundings: Does it smell? Is it to small? To big? To cold? To hot? To noisy? As you can see the list can go on.

3. Your presentation: Have you planned the program? Are you well prepared for emergencies? Is your presentation clearly outlined? Do you know what the outcome is supposed to be?

4. Are you fun to be around?: Do you have a sense of humor? Are you serious about non-serious things? Do you have an attitude? Do you complain in front of your audience?
