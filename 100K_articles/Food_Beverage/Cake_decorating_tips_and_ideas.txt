Cake decorating tips and Ideas


Baking cakes can be difficult but decorating them can be more challenging. While decorating a cake one has to take into consideration number of factors like flavor, texture and design of the cake. Its very important that you know from where you have to start the cake decoration. This article can help you with some useful tips that can help you on your way to decorating sweet masterpieces.

•	It’s very important that you allow the cake to cool down after it is baked. Give yourself at least 30 minutes before starting to apply frosting on the cake. 
•	You can use a whipped cream frosting to smoothen the decorating process. 
•	It would be advisable to start from the corners of the cake - they are hardest to frost
•	Frost the sides of the cake with lots of icing and steady hands. Start icing with thin layers before moving to the thicker ones.
•	Apply dollops of icing in the corners and in the middle of the cake.
•	Make sure the knife only touches the frosting part and not the cake.
•	You can apply icing to the cake as necessary. Be careful not to smear the icing that you already applied.
•	Use strokes to spread the icing on the cake. If the icing is difficult to spread try dipping your knife in hot water, which makes the icing spread faster. 
•	Style the frosting once it is applied by using a fork across the top of the cake to create a lattice effect. You can also use a knife to create swirls along the top edges of the cake.
