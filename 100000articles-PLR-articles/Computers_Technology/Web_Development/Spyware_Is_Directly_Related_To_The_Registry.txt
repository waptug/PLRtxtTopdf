What Is Spyware?

Spyware can be described as any software or program that installs itself on your system unannounced and begins to gather information about the use of the computer. This information is then mailed automatically to the person or persons who placed it on the Internet in the first place. So, what do these people do with your personal information?

Depending on the information they may sell it to marketing agencies, advertisers or any party that is interested in the information. The information may contain the type of system you use, the kind of sites you frequently visit or worse your usernames and passwords as well as your credit card information.

How Does Spyware Get Onto The System?

Spyware downloads itself to the computer when a user clicks on a download, accesses mail or browses sites with the hidden Spyware ready to download once the site is accessed. Spyware operates in the back ground while the computer is on. Once the computer is connected to the Internet the Spyware transmits the information to an email address.

All this slows down the system because the programs have to be slowed in order for the Spyware to get its job done. The registry also gets crammed with Spyware links and entries as well. The Spyware can be removed with anti virus software but the traces are stored in the registry and have to be completely removed with a Spyware remover such as Yahoo Spyware remover software or Kazaa Spyware remover utility.

This free Spyware remover software can be downloaded and run on the system free of cost. Removing redundant information from the registry will leave a smaller database for the registry to scan whenever a program requests for information. This speeds up the system a great deal. The end result of running anti Spyware will be an efficient computer that is a joy to work on.
