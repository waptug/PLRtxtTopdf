School children often dreads the hour when a quiz is given by their teacher, especially the ones who didn’t study their lessons. As a child grows, he or she still has to keep up with various examinations done in and out of the classroom.

What's in an examination or a quiz that most individuals fear? Well, if it's just a quiz for a school subject, you will only worry about the grades that you will get. But what if it's a quiz about your mental health?

A lot of people shy away from the subject of mental illness. Having a mental illness of some sort does not make you insane. That's the common misconception that people has to live with. Oftentimes, they are ashamed to let other people know that they have a problem. And if you're diagnosed with bipolar disorder, there's really no reason to be afraid or ashamed about it.

Bipolar patients have extreme episodes or mood swings, and though these things may not affect them, it can be very alarming to their family members. Friends, co-workers, relatives, and neighbors may also notice the mood swings especially if it’s already severe. The symptoms felt by bipolar patients are not the same all throughout. It differs from one individual to another. Others can experience mild symptoms while others have to go through severe episodes.

Bipolar disorder does not choose its patients. Men and women can have this illness because of certain factors. Though further studies are still underway, factors like genetics, biochemistry, environmental events, and seasons can cause bipolar disorder. 

Not all people are aware that they have the disorder. In fact, a great number of bipolar sufferers are not yet diagnosed. Most bipolar patients were diagnosed with the illness only after years of having it. If bipolar remains untreated, it can cause major disruptions in his or her everyday life; whether at home, at work, or in any other place. With the right professional attention, the bipolar patient can receive treatment and/or medication that are necessary to control their symptoms. Bipolar disorder cannot be cured; it can only be controlled and stabilized.

Bipolar disorder is not well-known to the public. In fact, according or many surveys, a lot of people are not even thinking about mood disorders. For every five respondent, 80% did not even address it as an illness or disorder. Most college students and people in their 40's are aware of the disorder, but other age groups have very little knowledge about bipolar and mood disorders.

This may be one reason why many cases of bipolar disorder are left undiagnosed. Many individuals may regard their condition as simple mood swings. When mood swings are already extreme, then you'd better think twice. 

The internet is a great avenue to help you in your problem. Try to observe the symptoms that you're exhibiting, and if you think you have the disorder, you can look into online quizzes. There are many sites that feature bipolar quizzes and you can use the search engines available like Google and Yahoo.

By taking several online depression quizzes, you will find out the different symptoms associated with bipolar disorder. And after the quiz, you will get the results easily. Bipolar online quizzes usually asks the following questions:

-	Are you suffering from extreme changes in mood?
-	Do you have a family member with bipolar?
-	Have you experienced the symptoms in intervals?  

If after a careful self-evaluation you think that you do have bipolar, then perhaps it’s time to visit a doctor. You have to consult the right person with the right background, and those that have dealt with bipolar disorder in the past. A psychiatrist can also help you in your struggle. They can provide you with the right medication and treatment that will work for you.

Bipolar quizzes are a great way to assess your situation. Mild mood swings are natural and should not be a cause of worry. However, quizzes like this can’t give you an accurate diagnosis. Bipolar is difficult to diagnose, that is why a lot of diagnosis are delayed. The symptoms felt by a bipolar patient can mimic those of other illnesses. Professional diagnosis is required. Take a quiz, and know your state.
