Summary:
Printers are devices that convert computer output into printed images. Serial printers print one character at a time moving across the paper. Electro sensitive, direct thermal, older daisy wheel, and even ink jet printers could be cataloged in this group; however, the primary desktop serial printer is the serial dot matrix printer, with speeds ranging from 200 to 400 cps, which is about 90 to 180 lines per minute.

Printers are devices that convert computer output into printed images. Serial printers print one character at a time moving across the paper. Electro sensitive, direct thermal, older daisy wheel, and even ink jet printers could be cataloged in this group; however, the primary desktop serial printer is the serial dot matrix printer, with speeds ranging from 200 to 400 cps, which is about 90 to 180 lines per minute. 

Line printers print a line at a time from approximately 400 to 2,000 lpm and are commonly found in datacenters and industrial environments. Earlier technologies included drum, chain, train and dot band matrix technologies. The surviving technologies use band and line matrix mechanisms, and there are a lot of reviews of digital photo printers out there. 

Digital Printers

Page printers print a page at a time from four to more than 800 ppm. Laser, LED, solid ink and electron beam imaging printers fall into this category. All of these printers adhere to toner or ink onto a drum which is transferred to the entire page in one cycle for black and white and multiple cycles for color. You can find this information in almost all reviews of digital photo printers. Impact printers were developed for the first early computers which were popular a few decades back.

Dot band matrix printers used a combination of band printer and dot matrix methods. Electron Beam Imaging is a technology somewhat similar to a laser printer, except that electricity is used to create the image instead of light. This evolved from ion deposition and is used in very high-speed page printers exceeding 800 ppm, which at reviews of digital photo printers could not bee seen. Laser printers have had a lot going for them lately. The prices are falling, they are cheaper for volume printing and the text prints are always better than any Inkjet printer you can ever buy. 

Our conclusion on printers

Laser printers are also incredibly faster than most of the Inkjet printers, and if you are doing continuous printouts, they will simply floor you with the speed, as many reviews of digital photo printers say. There are quite a few things that you must consider before buying a Laser printer. The first and foremost thing that you need to think about and that is covered in most reviews of digital photo printers is whether you want a color laser or a mono laser. Laser printers can’t print on thick photo quality paper, so if you want to print really high quality photos you should stick to Inkjet printers.
