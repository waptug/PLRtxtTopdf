Since most collectors prefer buying valuable collectables locally or at least in person, you may want to take the same approach.  Your first stop should be a local anime dealer, if one exists.  As the anime genre increases in popularity, many specialty anime shops are popping up across the country, especially in larger cities.

Anime collectors looking to expand their collections are also urged to visit their local hobby shops.

In keeping with buying anime collectables from dealers in person, collectors are urged to examine and attend anime events and conventions.  These are increasing in popularity and many occur on local, national, and international levels.  The internet is a great way to stay updated and informed on any anime events or conventions, especially those where dealers will be present.  In addition to being able to buy collectables from a professional anime dealer, you may also find a wealth of valuable information at anime themed events.

Despite the fact that many anime collectors prefer to make their purchases in person, especially when dealing with rare and valuable pieces, many others do not have the luxury of doing so.  If you are one of those individuals, you will want to turn to the internet.  There are a large number of hobby shops and specialty amine dealers that have online websites.  Many are similar in nature and contain a large selection of anime collectables, often for a wide range of prices.

In keeping with the internet, another great way to find an anime dealer is by networking.  If you enjoy anime collecting, you should join an online community, also commonly referred to as an online message board, that focuses on this great hobby.  In addition to pointing you to well-known and reputable dealers, you may also find other collectors willing to sell or trade their merchandise.
