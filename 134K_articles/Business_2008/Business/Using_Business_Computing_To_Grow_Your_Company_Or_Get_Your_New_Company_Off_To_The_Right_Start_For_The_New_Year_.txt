If you’re a new startup company then hold on because besides making suggestions for existing companies I am also going to give some good ideas to research for your new business as well that might just help your business get off to the right start for business computing and Information Technology. 

Even if your company did not have a good year then maybe this article will give you some ideas to research or think about that might turn your business around. 
 
To start if you have been in business for a few years and your business is starting to experience good grow and profits then it might be time to review the office and computer equipment that you have on hand. Is the equipment new or over 3 to 4 years old and how did some of the office equipment impact your bottom line last year. For example did that old printer need to be serviced a lot or jam or break down a lot costing you productivity and expenses to have someone fix it all the time. If this is an issue then it might just be time to get a replacement for your office. Like all office equipment printers will needed to be replaced you should evaluate just how much all the down time and service cost was for that printer and then look a cost for good replacement you might be surprised that getting a new printer might actually save your business money over time. Even if you paid for printing services you might want to review the cost and see if investing in printer will save you money. 
 
Another good example would be if some of your employees are using older computer that take longer to process data and job task. Again if you think about cost in man hours and delay you might find it is costing you more then a good replacement computer for those people.
 
Alright you looked at your office and all the equipment and your really don’t find any old equipment that is causing problem as matter of fact your office is running pretty good. Then if your company does not have a presents on the web maybe it is time to look at investing in setting up a web link and resource for your company. The same goes for startup companies since this can be low cost although it can also become expensive if you pay for different services to promote your business but it can really promote your business. Think about it this way by having a webpage for your business you have a good way to show your customers and business partners the great products and services that your company offers. I will be posting a new article that will discuss more about putting your business on the web in a few days. 
 
Another thing that you can look at improving or changing is servers if you have them. If you have 2 or 10 servers that have been running for sometime then maybe this might be a good time to upgrade them by adding storage capacity or even replacing them with more efficient ones. Servers can be one the most expensive investment but they usually will last sometime before you have to replace them. 

Another item you might want to look at is your computer networking. If your company is running a T1 or just a DSL line you might want to look at expanding it especially if your company is expanding and is send more data and information or doing more online research. Also if your office is growing in size and you might have to upgrade your network switch especially if you noted serious slow downs. Another thing to think with company networking is security and firewalls which is an item that you might think about to help protect your growing company. Also don’t forget another great investment is backup equipment and software after all backing up your data can save you in the long run and keeps your vital business records safe even if a main computer crashes that had customer or project data on it with backups you can quickly recover afterward. 

The last item to look at is software and tools that you run for you business. Maybe it is time to upgrade or invest in some new software tools that will help you increase productivity or help you attract new customers. The investment in the right software tools could really add to your business help you attract new customers. A good example is if you company runs Pro-E tools for mechanical design only then you might want to also add some other tools such as Cad tools to do designs. If you notice that a lot customer wanted some Cad designs as well as Pro-E layouts then you just added to the service you can provide to existing customer and you might find new customers that only want the new Cad designs services so you have just expanded your business just by adding one software tool. This is just an example of how one software tool can add to your business before you invest in a new tool be sure that the cost is worth the investment and it adds to your business. 
 
In conclusion business computing improvements to your business by adding to productivity and efficiency of the day to day operations and can help you take on more clients and over all help you build your business.
