Keeping in Touch with Letters

This activity will require some planning before school is out and is meant for children 
who are already reading and writing.  With the help of the child’s teacher you can arrange 
a pen pal system or get the mailing addresses of all the children in the class.  This is 
especially important if a child is going away for the summer to get the mailing address 
where they will be.

What fun it is to receive mail from a friend.  If a child is going away for the summer it 
will keep them connected with their classmates and it can make the back to school 
transition easier.  In addition to keeping in touch it will help build children’s reading, 
writing and communication skills.

If you weren’t able to get the addresses of your child’s classmates before school was out 
it doesn’t mean you still can’t do this activity.  If there are family members who are on 
vacation or live far away have them write a letter to them.  

Another fun way to spin this activity is to make a mailbox for every member of the 
family that is positioned outside of their bedroom doors.  Once a week, each person in the 
family has to write a letter to another.  It would be best to draw names for this activity so 
no one gets left out without a letter.  Put the name of the person on the envelope and one 
child can play the part of mailman delivering the letters to the right mailboxes.

You can use a shoebox or a small cereal box that is decorated as the letter holder.  Make 
it authentic; give the mailman a bag to carry the letters around in as they make their 
deliveries.  

Let the children make their own stationary by decorating plain paper and envelopes – it 
doesn’t have t be expensive or fancy.
