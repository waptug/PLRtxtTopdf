Article Body:
Wire decking is mainly used in large warehouses where the company does not have the time to spend on repairing wooden decks. They need a stable base because they need decking material capable of sustaining heavy loads. Decking made from mesh wire is easy to install because it just falls into place. It is self-cleaning, which means it is basically maintenance free. Although you can have wire decking for a residential deck, as a rule this material is basically used in commercial settings. 

For cheaper decking, used wire is also a possibility. Since the wire mesh is made from galvanized steel, you won’t have to bother with rust and corrosion. You can pick up the used wire decking at sales and realize tremendous savings in the cost of buying the wire you need for your decking. For decking, wire mesh is made in the sizes that you need. The custom deck rack is made to fit a specific depth and usually two pieces of wire mesh are set side to side to complete the decking. 

In the case of wire decking, the word deck means something completely different that it does when talking about other kinds of decking. For commercial uses in decking, wire mesh refers to large racks where businesses store large containers or heavy objects. The wire mesh is white and makes the whole area bright. With the holes in the mesh it is quite easy to see where everything is stored when you are looking for a specific product. The properties of the wire make it very long lasting and durable. For many homeowners who want to have this type of decking, used wire is a cost saving solution to having racks on the wall of the shed or garage. 

Wire decking is galvanized after it is welded to provide the customer with a lifetime of resistance to rust. Some manufacturers of this type of decking use a gray colored paint as the finish. You have to be wary of this type of decking. Wire mesh with this finish added to it often tends to chip and peel after years of heavy use and provides a used look to your warehouse. When you buy decking, wire that has been treated with an electro-galvanized finish will retain its new look for a lifetime. For cheap decking, used wire with this finish will look brand new. 

When you have wire decking in your warehouse or even your shed, the light will absorb through the wire mesh giving you a clear view of what you have stored on the decking. Because of the fire retardant properties of wire decking, you may also save money on your fire insurance costs.
