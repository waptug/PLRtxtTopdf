So how do you find an all-inclusive that is right for you? And at the same time avoid spending your honeymoon or vacation surrounded by other people's children if you don't want to? Or maybe that would be exactly what you were looking for.

Brands such as Sandals and Super Clubs first and foremost cater to adults. Other brands of all-inclusive: Breezes, Franklyn D and Beaches resorts welcome families with children. And Club Med has developed into more of a family oriented all-inclusive company, but it still has some outposts that cater especially to adult singles or couples.

The fastest way to recognize if an all-inclusive is restricted to adults is by determining if it limits guests to age 16 and older. You can typically find this information by glance over the company Web site or call the 800 reservations number.

The good thing about booking a package deal is that you get much more at a resort than just a room and a bed to sleep in.

A lot of destinations tempt travellers with a list of activities and facilities so broad that a couple couldn't possibly take advantage of them in a month. That's why it's essential to look at these deals closely. Do not get overwhelmed; just relax and keep in mind that quality counts more than quantity.

Just because some services are included in a All-Inclusive resort package does not mean that it is not factored into the all-in-one price. For instance, a couple who drinks very little may do better without a meal plan that includes all they can drink. Or what about a couple who loves to Jet Ski, they should choose a place where Jet Ski is included at no extra cost, because it is an expensive sport.
