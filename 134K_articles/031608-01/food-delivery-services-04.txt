My older sister, for example, uses a food delivery service in Boston. It basically connects her to local farmers as part of a buyers club. Every week, a selection of fresh fruit is delivered straight to her door. It varies from week to week, but it is always delicious. Best of all, it is inexpensive and locally grown. She can feel good about how she's eating while enjoying delicious foods and helping out local farmers.

There are quite a few organic food delivery services like this, but some people are in the market for a more specialized kind of fare. Chances are, if you look for it, you can find it. For example, the other day I was going to have some guests over. It was a pretty last-minute party, and I didn't have time to organize and plan a full meal. Fortunately, food delivery services came to rescue. There was a local catering service offering last-minute food delivery of several delicious gourmet standbys. It was a little bit expensive – gourmet food usually is – but was absolutely delicious. I swear, I have never had better beef wellington to in my life!
