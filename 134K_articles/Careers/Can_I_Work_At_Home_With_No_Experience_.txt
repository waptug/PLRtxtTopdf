Summary:
I see this question asked pretty frequently, and today I'd like to offer some tips about how to get started working at home when you have no experience.

- Consider the experience you do have, whether it's work or life related. Chances are you know how to do SOMETHING, even if you haven't done it in a job capacity. See if you can find jobs that would use the knowledge you have, or at least touch on them in some way.

I see this question asked pretty frequently, and today I'd like to offer some tips about how to get started working at home when you have no experience.

- Consider the experience you do have, whether it's work or life related. Chances are you know how to do SOMETHING, even if you haven't done it in a job capacity. See if you can find jobs that would use the knowledge you have, or at least touch on them in some way.

- Aim for "easier" jobs to begin with, like outbound telemarketing. Most of the ads I see for those jobs don't require experience, they will teach you everything you need to know. Granted, these are usually commission-based jobs, but sometimes they do offer a small salary too. If anything, you could work this job for a few months to get experience, and then apply for other jobs later.

- Start your own business. Some people do incredibly well by finding a home business that matches their interests and life experience. While you may be tempted to search for a regular "job," know that that is not your only option! Give some thought to your strongest interests and passions in life. Then start looking for a home business that reflects them. There are hundreds (even thousands) of direct sales companies with great products out there. You just have to find the one that works for you.

- Educate yourself. Sign up for some adult education classes to expand your education. Take courses on Microsoft Word, Excel, Access, Powerpoint. Learn about accounting software. Do a search online for "free tutorials," and see what comes up. You can also include the type of tutorial in your search, like "free Paint Shop Pro tutorials," if you need to learn a certain program. Whatever field you want to be in, seek out affordable classes to learn about it. Then, even if you don't have experience, an employer might be willing to train you because you have the basic knowledge needed for the job.

Just don't give up, and don't let your lack of experience stop you! Everyone has to start somewhere. :-)
