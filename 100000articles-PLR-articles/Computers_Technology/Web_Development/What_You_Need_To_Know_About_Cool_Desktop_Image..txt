For some, may not yet have realized how easy it is to find desktop wallpaper. There are thousands of websites that offer desktop images, but you are by no means restricted to these sites. In fact any picture that you have on your computer can be used as a desktop image. You simply have to load it onto your windows memory as wallpaper, and you can then either tile it, or put it up in the center of the screen. Or you can even stretch it to fill the whole screen if the image is not big enough by itself, and that will look very nice, you can be sure.
