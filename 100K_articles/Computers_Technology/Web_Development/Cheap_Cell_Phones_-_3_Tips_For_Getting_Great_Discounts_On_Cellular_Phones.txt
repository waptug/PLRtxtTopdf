1. Online shopping and auction sites - Sites like Amazon and eBay make it really easy to do mobile phone price comparisons and you will usually find your best deals here. Shopping online isn’t only convenient and cheap, it also gives you the greatest selection of mobile phones. Highly recommended!

2. Your local retail store - Shopping at a local retail location like a carrier store or a Best Buy, Circuit City, etc. is a good way to shop for your new cellular phone because you will generally find competitive pricing and you’ll be able to get a hands on experience with the phones you’re looking at. Sometimes you need to “touch and feel” something before buying it and these are great places to go if you want to check out mobile phones first hand.

3. Buy pre-owned cell phones - You shouldn’t rule out preowned cellular phones. Often times, you can snag a great deal through online classified sites such as Craigslist on gently used cell phones that work as well as the day they rolled out off the factory. Many cell phone users feel a need to have the very latest and greatest phones, and as a result will sell their previous phone at a steep discount. Buying used cellphones is a great idea, just be sure that the phone you’re buying isn’t stolen.

Hopefully this article has given you some really good ideas on where to start looking for cheap cell phone deals. If you do a little searching, there are some excellent deals and discounts to be had on mobile phones.
