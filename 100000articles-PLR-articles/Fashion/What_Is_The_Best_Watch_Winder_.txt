People keep asking me – which watch winder to buy. Surprisingly, there are dozens of different watch winders in the market. You could always find a discount watch winder or buy the cheapest watch winders, but most of the automatic watch owners are dealing with the decision whether to buy Steinhausen watch winders, Scatola watch winders or Eilux watch winder.

For the sake of propriety, a few words about watch winders: Automatic watch winders are mainly used for two purposes: 

1. Automatic watch winder – Automatic watches are getting more and more common. Instead of rewinding the watch manually each time the power reserve is out, one can use a watch winder. It may get more complicated to manually wind watches with complicated parameters such as perpetual calendar and moon phase. 

2. Winding watches with screwed crowns – Each time one screws or unscrews the crown is worn down. Watch winders will enable the watch to operate for a longer time.

Before we go on, I must add one more suggestion: When buying a new watch winder, get also a watch winder box or a watch winder case to protect your watch winder. 

The number one automatic watch winder is definitely the Scatola watch winder. The Scatola watch winder is designed by world class artisans. In fact, Scatola watch winders are manufactured in limited quantities so you can be sure of the extra care that goes into each watch winder. A Scatola watch winder is made of quality products such as gold plated clasps and zippers, and Swiss made high precision micro motors.

The next best watch winder would have to be the Steinhausen watch winder. A Steinhausen watch winders certainly has the best prestige look of all automatic watch winders. It is the best way to display your watches collection in your living room and impress your friends.
