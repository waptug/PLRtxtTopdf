Article Body:
I just came back from a vacation in St. Maarten, the Caribbean and stayed in one of finest luxury vacation villas. It was  located in the hills, with mid sized mountains and spectacular ocean views. Spacious, sunny terrace and shady veranda, which make outdoor living the most relaxing I have ever experienced yet. I had a view that will take your breath away, whether its the turquoise blue sea, a panoramic view from a hillside, or the twinkling lights at night. The villa had a fully equipped kitchen, with some of true gourmet quality. Maid service was provided 6 days per week and the villa had a private pool, TV/VCR/DVD and stereo system.
