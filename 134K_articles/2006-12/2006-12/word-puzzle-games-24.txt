Word Puzzle Games

I have always loved words, so naturally I have always loved word puzzle games. For the most part, I stick to crossword puzzles, but there are other ones out there that are just as fun. I started out with word searches when I was very young, but as I got older and smarter, the challenge of the crossword puzzle became more to my liking. If you like these games, you can find them both in books and online.

You can find word puzzle games almost anywhere you buy books or magazines. These are often rated easy and difficult, and what you can do might depend on how you feel that day. Some days I am so wiped out that the easy ones are too hard, and on other days I can breeze though the difficult. My brother also loves these word puzzle books, and if you are having a hard time buying for him, a stack of these is always a hit. You find them laying around his house every time you visit, and the takes them with him for long car rides. As long as you don’t get car sick, these are great road trip time wasters.

If you are looking for word puzzle games online, you can find a huge variety of different puzzles. Some are more complicated, and others are made just for action. Some are spelling games, which can double as learning tools if you want to learn new words, and others will play off the meanings and uses of words. Many involve a time limit, which makes you think on your feet. One particular game gives you letters, and you have to see how many words you can come up with from just those letters. I have greatly expanded my own vocabulary by playing these types of games.

Word puzzle games are more than just games, and you can use them to help your children learn vocabulary and spelling. You want to find the easiest word puzzle games you can find, but once they get going, you might be surprised at how much they have learned in a short time. In my experience, nothing works faster than camouflaging learning in the form of a game. Many teachers know this, and that is why they often have word puzzle games as a part of their curriculum. If you are home schooling your children, you should keep this in mind.
