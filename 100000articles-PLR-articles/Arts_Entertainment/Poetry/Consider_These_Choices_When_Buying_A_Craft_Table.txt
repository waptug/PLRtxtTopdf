No matter whether you're looking for a craft table for your kids or one to display all your latest creations at the local Craft Fair, purchasing the right kind and size of table for your needs takes just a little forethought.

A craft table can be an invaluable tool for any home, whether children are going to create monsters out of clay on It or you need something to work on for your own craft designs and needs. Some people use these tables only occasionally, while others use them daily. The best kind table to get is something that can be easily stored when not in use.

A folding table is your best bet, no matter what you need it for, and many can find inexpensive varieties at local Wal-Mart or Target stores. Buying a table at a craft supply store is also an option, though you may end up spending more than you want to. However, tables offered by craft stores are often geared toward specific needs, so if you're particular, you may want to start looking at the craft store as opposed to the local retail stores.

While some may cringe at the original outlay of expense for a good, sturdy and practical craft table, the benefits of owning one will more than pay for its cost in ease of use, convenience and space. Easy storage offers an added bonus. Before you race out to purchase a crafting table however, know what you need it for before you start shopping.

Are you going to use the table only occasionally, and for non-crafty purposes? Do you need it for designing, sewing, artwork or drafting? Is your future craft table going to be used in the basement or the kitchen, or will it be stored in your car for craft fairs and swap meet needs?

A narrow table will benefit kitchens and smaller rooms, such as children's bedrooms, but a wider, longer table will work well for craft fairs and basement areas. Determining where you can store the table when it's not in use is another key factor in the decision to purchase a particular width or length of craft table. Will your table be stored in the car, a broom closet or leaned up against a wall? Think about that before you buy.

Sometimes, a table will include pouches or compartments to store items that range from pens and pencils to yarns, knitting needles and bolts of fabric. Those types of tables won't be able to fold and store as easily as a plain table, so take that into consideration when you're shopping.

A craft table can be used for other things besides creating crafts, such as puzzle fitting, card playing and gift-wrapping. They are usually available in square shapes or rectangles and can come in wide or narrow widths. They can be super sturdy or a little wobbly, but determining who will most likely be using it most, in addition to the purpose of the table in the first place, will help you make the right decision when it comes to purchasing that craft table that you just can't do without.
