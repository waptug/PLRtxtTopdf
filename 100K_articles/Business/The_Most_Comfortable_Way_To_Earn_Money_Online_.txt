Article Body:
The home business industry grows like never before. More and more people are interested nowadays to make a living on the internet. One major question comes to mind when talking about making money online:

You might be surprised about this common question because it is not which business opportunity makes the most money or how to succeed in a home business. When thinking about the human character it becomes more and more logic. The often asked question is: What is the most comfortable way of creating an income? 

Yes, that is what many people ask themselves because mostly human beings are looking for ways to not leave their comfort zone. Now it doesn't necessarily mean that humans are lazy, it just means that naturally, a person will look for a way to comfortably achieve his or her goal.

Knowing this is critical for your home business success because if you find a business opportunity which is likely to feel comfortable for the prospect, chances are good that that your conversions are much higher.

So what is a comfortable home business?
Well, to understand this we should look at the opposite and what most people don't like about business opportunities. It is very easy to see that people don't want to be sold. They don't want to make a list of friends and family, they don't want to cold-call anyone and they definitely don't want to talk to strangers on the street.

What is the solution to all this?
It is suggested to take a close look at affiliate marketing because in affiliate marketing you only need to do one thing and that is driving traffic to your sales page. You will not have to call anyone, you will not have to do any follow ups and you definitely don't need to talk to strangers on the street. All you do is drive traffic to your website and automate that process.

If one is good a driving traffic to his website, the reward is prosperous. With average conversions of two to six percent, one is likely to achieve an extraordinary income. Say for example you make fifty dollars per sale and you drive 250 visitors to your website daily. That's with an average conversion of four percent, an income of 500 dollars per day or 15,000 dollars per month. 

Now the question is not if there are affiliate programs which pay 50 dollars commission, or if a conversion of four percent is realistic! All of these factors are very doable. The only question is: Are you willing to learn how to get traffic to your website?
