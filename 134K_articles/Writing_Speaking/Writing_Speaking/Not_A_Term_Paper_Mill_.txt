Article Body:
I have seen jobs posted for help with term papers. What I mean by "help" is a little more than editing a student's term paper. Specifically, there are college students who are willing to pay hundreds of dollars to have someone else write a paper for them. This practice is nothing new, but it is much more prevalent than many folks realize.

Truthfully, I could probably make a good sum of money writing term papers for the rich kids out there. In college, I usually garnered an "A" or "A-" on my papers. Yes, I did quite well and that was due to my paying attention to what the <u>professor wanted written</u> and being thorough with my research.  Once my research was completed, I worked very hard to produce a "jam up" paper. It was exhausting work, but personally rewarding!

So, my policy is this: write the paper yourself. Learn how to do it the right way and show some integrity and fortitude. You will be a better person for it, too, and prove to yourself that you can overcome a challenge. 

How about you? Do you accept every project that comes along or do you have certain standards in place? How you answer these questions speaks volumes about you as a writer and as a person.
