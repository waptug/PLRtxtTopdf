Article Body:
A home based business must be built on a solid foundation to succeed. When you hear the words "free money making opportunity" you might think it's too good to be true. But in reality, there are many legitimate free money making opportunities that enable you to sign on for free and earn a profitable income from your efforts.

Keep in mind that when a program is free to join, this doesn't automatically mean a free ride. It means you don't have to sign up with a fee to sell their products or their money making opportunities. You can become a promoter of their offer without paying to join. This differs from many network marketing opportunities in which you must pay to be a member or pay to promote their products. 

Key Elements of a Free Money Making Opportunity

The key elements to look for in a free money making opportunity are: it's absolutely free to join with no fee now or later; it's a program with a reputable company with a good track record on payments and customer service; it's something you can easily incorporate in your daily schedule and still earn money online. The opportunity should allow flexibility but should also have set guidelines that are explained clearly up front. These guidelines are meant to help you understand the system and know your limitations in promoting their products.

Types of Free Money Making Opportunities

There are many different ways to make money on the Internet. If you have an existing Web business, you might consider selling advertising on your website. Some types of advertising opportunities include contextual ads (such as Yahoo Content Publishing or Google AdSense), banner advertising, e-zine advertising, or pay-per-play ad slots (ads heard on your site, but not seen - for branding companies). With this type of Internet business, you'll earn website money every time you receive a visitor or click through on your site. The more targeted traffic you have, the more you'll earn.

There are also affiliate programs in which you earn money for promoting someone else's products or services from your website. Some programs will set up a website for you so all you'll have to do is promote the Web address they give you. But beware of programs that offer duplicate sites to hundreds or thousands of affiliates. This could hinder your promotions because the competition will be very heavy.

How to Earn Money on the Internet

With a free money making opportunity, your monetary risks are minimal. You'll want to focus on how to promote the business effectively while spending the least amount of money on advertising. Once you find a great business or advertising venue, do research on promotion methods. Some of the most popular are paid searches through major search engines, banner or e-zine advertising, online auctions, article ads, online malls, traffic exchanges, pop-up advertising, and press releases. Test each avenue to find the ones that are effective for your particular business. And remember, no two Internet businesses will be the same.

Once you find some promotional methods that work, then start finding ways to earn a residual income from your efforts. Residual income might come in the form of advertising on your site where you receive monthly checks, affiliate programs that pay over and over for the same customer, or even opportunities where you can earn a lifetime monthly, quarterly, or yearly commission as long as the customer remains with the company.

With a free money making opportunity, you can sign up without worries of losing an initial investment. So start searching online today for that perfect home based business!
