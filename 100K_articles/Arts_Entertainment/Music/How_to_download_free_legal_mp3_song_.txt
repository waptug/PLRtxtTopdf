Article Body:
MP3 is very popular as it can be easily downloaded across the internet and used with memory based audio players. It compresses the original sound file into very small file (one twelfth of the original file) but still preserves the original quality of sound when played. MP3 files have the extension “.mp3” 

Many artists now use the MP3 technology as it could be easily distributed over the internet. As such, there are many songs available on the internet in MP3 format which are not authorized by the artist or music company. This has created a situation of music piracy whereby music of a third party is being put online and freely distributed without their concern. Therefore many mp3 songs over the internet are found to be illegal. 

 Many websites have started taking the advantage of free legal mp3 song download by adding pop ups, illegal spyware software. There are other legal sources from where you can safely download mp3 songs. While you check out for some good quality mp3 songs over the internet you should take care of some of the following facts:

1.  You should always look out for the quality of mp3 song file. This means you should download music files that are above 128 kbps. In case you download files below this you shall get a disturbed and bad quality sound when you actually burn the track into your CD. MP3 files with 20 kbps gives you a blur quality and 320 kbps shall be equivalent to a quality of an original CD. 

2. Before you make a download, you should check that you have a good internet speed and it might happen that you have to restart the computer in order to get optimum internet speed. You will get any song downloaded within 10 minutes if you have a speed of 3 Kb/s.
