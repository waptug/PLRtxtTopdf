I’m an average guy.  I’m online.  I am sometimes trying to get something done and at other times I am just spending time looking up different sites online.  You are a business.  You are trying to accomplish your company’s goals.  You are trying to find success.  These are two obviously separate tracks.  For me, I don’t care.  Your company’s success doesn’t concern me.  However for you, my actions online are important.  Thusly, it is up to you to find a way in which these two separated worlds must find some common ground.  How will you do it?

You need to advertise.  How will you do that?  There are currently several online internet advertising techniques.  There are pop-ups, banner ads, emails, and a plethora of other advertising mechanisms.  What do you think of these?  Do you like them?  Do you think that they convey the identity that you want for your company?  

The advertising that you use needs to make me want to engage myself with your business.  Do these online ads do that?  If I clicked on one of these ads for your company will I find the things that your ad promised?  Do you want me to?  

You know that there are literally millions of internet ads online, do you like them?  Do you think that they perform the function that they should?  What is that function?  It could be to get me to click once.  It could also be to build awareness in me that you are able to assist me if I am interested in the product or service that you offer.  You could work with me once or for years to come.  How can you facilitate the difference?  I think you have a lot of work ahead of you.
