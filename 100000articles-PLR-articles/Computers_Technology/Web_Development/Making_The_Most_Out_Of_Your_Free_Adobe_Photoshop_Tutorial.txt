You may be having the very best of the world's free Adobe photoshop tutorials, but if you yourself are not prepared for it and not as driven to devise ways to maximize your learning, you may find yourself unable to get your money and time's worth from your Adobe photoshop tutorial. A free Adobe photoshop tutorial is very loose and does not really compel you to give it time on a regular basis. You hold the decision ultimately on what terms you are going about with the free tutorial, along with many other things. 

Be Consistent
Regardless of the amount of time and type of tutorial you are under, consistency is key to be able to really make it work. Set aside a time and place for your learning. You can't just expect to learn a lot if you are not able to devote much time and energy to learning the concepts on a regular basis. It takes 21 days to make a habit, so at least get in the tutorial for 21 days at a fixed time and place so that you will be able to make the tutorial part of your daily routine online. 

Set a Target
You must have a goal of completing the free tutorial if you want to be continually motivated to finish the course. That way, you will be free to take your learning to new levels and aim for advanced topics in the fastest possible time that your schedule will permit. A target will ensure that you are going somewhere and that will help you efficiently map out how you are to go about with your learning. 

Apply Every Concept You Learn for Faster Retention
Merely reading the concepts won't make you a photoshop genius. You need to really install the software and apply whatever concept you learn from your free tutorial. Applying the concepts also helps you master it more quickly. That way, when new concepts build, you will better be able to integrate the new concepts with the old concepts you have painstakingly taken the time to apply. By the time you finish the free tutorial, you will be able to do it with less questions and worries, and you will also be well-equipped enough to teach others. 

Get a Learning Buddy
Having someone to follow up on your progress or learn the tricks of the trade with you is one of the more efficient ways to learn. You will be able to have accountability and not be slack if you have someone to work with in learning from the free tutorial. Being able to regularly talk about your progress and goals from the tutorial will keep you in the right perspective.  

Note and Track Your Progress
Have a checklist handy. There you will be able to track your progress in learning. If you happen to have things you specifically want to learn from photoshop, take note of them and list them accordingly. Mark those which you have already accomplished so that you will be able to know how capable you are becoming and how much more skill training is needed. This way, you will also be able to determine how much more time you need to practice on certain topics to further cement the knowledge that you have acquired from the tutorial.
