Named after the European explorer Francisco de Coronado, the Coronado Springs Resort combines the beauty, fantasy and unique cultural elements of colonial Spain, Mexico and New Mexico. Accommodations come in the form of casitas (little houses), which represent urban centers like Santa Fe or Monterrey. The casitas are nestled amidst plazas, fountains and palm-shaded courtyards.

The resort is built around Lake Lago Dorado, with a stepped Mayan pyramid towering over the pool area. The grounds of the casitas are decorated with lovely fountains and gardenia bushes. Besides the casitas, there are also ranchos, which are 2- and 3- story pueblo-style villas representing the rustic charm of rural Spain.

A cool feature of the resort is that almost all throughout its compound, you can look across water and see the other areas.
