I have had the privilege to travel to all fifty states in America over the last ten years. For some reason, all of my training in writing has somehow qualified me to travel our great country and to take in some of the best (and worst) things that cities all over the US have to offer. So I've spent my fair share of time in cities all over the country, and I'll be the first to tell you that few cities compare to the charm of Charleston.

One of the best places in South Carolina, Charleston is a great city to visit for so many reasons. For starters, being the history lover that I am, there is so much to be learned in and around Charleston that I could be busy for days on end just soaking up the rich history of the area and of the state. You can find amazing tours and visit amazing museums that will teach you more than you could imagine about significant people and events that are rooted in Charleston.

Another great reason to visit Charleston is the sheer beauty of the place. I have been to few cities that have ranked nearly as high on the scale of natural beauty as Charleston. There is something about the quaintness of the city that invites visitors in and makes them feel like they are a part of something special. Charleston is big enough but not too big to get overwhelmed in. It is the perfect size to visit.

Charleston also boasts great hospitality, and I have never been let down when it comes to feeling welcomed and at home in this great southern state. The people are always warm and friendly and ready to help in any way possible. If you want to experience true southern hospitality, than Charleston is the place for your next trip. You'll love the wide variety of great bed and breakfasts you can stay in and you'll be filled all the time with great southern cooking.

Do a quick internet search about Charleston or pick up a book at your local library. Read for yourself all this great city has to offer. And then, when it comes time to plan your next vacation, look no further than Charleston, South Carolina. You'll be glad you chose it and you may even find yourself wanting to visit again. Charleston is truly one of the best undiscoverd cities in our great country. See for yourself.
