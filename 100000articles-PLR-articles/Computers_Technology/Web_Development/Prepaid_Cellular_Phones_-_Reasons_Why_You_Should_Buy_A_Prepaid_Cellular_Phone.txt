So, what exactly are prepaid cellular phones? A prepaid phone is one in which you purchase the phone and minutes upfront. There are no contracts, no credit checks, and it’s impossible to run up massive cell phone bills with prepaid cellular phones. Now that you know what these are, let’s talk about a few of the reasons why you should consider buying one.

For one, a prepaid cellular phone doesn’t require a credit check in order to set up service. This is great for anyone who has a bad credit history because a traditional cell phone contract would require a substantial deposit from them.

Secondly, a prepaid mobile phone doesn’t require you to sign any long-term contracts. Since you are purchasing your usage minutes upfront, you won’t end up getting locked into a contract just to obtain service. This is great for anyone who is unsure about their situation and doesn’t know where they will be in a year or so.

Lastly, prepaid cell phones eliminate those shockingly expensive bills that seem to come out of nowhere. With a pre-paid phone, it’s impossible to run over your minutes and end up with a huge bill that you can’t pay. This makes pre-paid cellular phones an excellent choice for parents who have teenagers. Kids love to talk on the phone, and with a prepaid phone you’ll never have to worry about your child overusing their phone.

Hopefully this article has given you some food for thought as to why you might want to consider buying a prepaid cellular phone. While they don’t have a sexy reputation, prepaid phones definitely do serve a purpose and can really come in handy.
