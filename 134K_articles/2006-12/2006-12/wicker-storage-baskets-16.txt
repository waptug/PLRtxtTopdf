There are so many things that you can do with wicker storage baskets. These handy items are not only great organizational tools they are attractive as well. Wicker storage baskets come in a variety of colors and styles. Finding a set to suit your décor is simple.

You can find wicker storage baskets in just about any department store but I like to check out my local arts and crafts stores first. Sometimes you can find great deals on this kind of product in stores that stock items like baskets and containers for decorative projects around the home.

I also like to shop online for these kinds of items because the selection is endless when using the Internet. I like a lot of options and when it comes to wicker storage baskets there are plenty of choices to make. Following are some different styles that may spark some interest.

The stair wicker storage baskets are cleverly designed to sit comfortably on your steps. The design makes the item appear as if it is a decorative feature. However, you can fill this container with nearly anything that has to be taken up the steps. 

Instead of piling objects right in plain view you can collect them in a handy wicker storage basket for your next trip up the steps. The stair design is simple. The basket is actually shaped like a step so it rests perfectly on the stairs without wobbling or toppling over. A simple handle on top of the container makes it easy to move.

The main purpose of wicker storage baskets is to keep items organized in an attractive way. Some of the containers have lids that help to conceal items like office supplies and art supplies. You need to keep these things handy but also out of sight if at all possible. The wicker storage baskets that have lids make great camouflage and you always know where your things are.

Some of the containers have liners that add a little fabric. I love the look of brown baskets with eggshell colored liners. I liked the look so much that I decided to buy some wicker storage baskets for my daughter’s room. She fills them with toys and her room is a snap to clean. 

I chose white wicker storage baskets with pink and white gingham lining. These useful containers add such great texture and color to the room that I bought matching gingham curtains to go with them. You know that you have found a great product when you begin to decorate around it.
