Getting Started

Before you engage in digital photography, you need to know the basic principles involved in taking pictures and composing your subject. Even if you can later on edit your pictures and correct some color mistakes, focusing and even shuffle or add some objects into the picture with the use of your computer, you should not really rely on the editing alone to produce good pictures. Always remember that editing your pictures will take a lot of time so it would be best to compose your pictures well before hand so that you will no longer spend so much time trying to make your pictures look better.

Composing a picture involves the arrangement of the people and objects in the picture. Although composing a picture comes naturally to some people, others may find if rather difficult to create balance and symmetry in their photos. If you happen to be one of those people who are having problems composing your pictures, you need to study this art. To learn how to compose your pictures, you need to read some photography books and magazines. Pay close attention to the balance and symmetry of the pictures in the photography books and magazines. Try to practice taking picture indoors and outdoors so that you will get used to dealing with objects under different types of lighting. It may take sometime before you can get these things perfectly but since you are not really in a big hurry to produce professional looking pictures, just take you time and have some fun.

While working on your skills on composing your pictures, you also need to learn to work with the different types of lighting. Note that lighting could affect the colors of your pictures. Poor light can make your pictures look dark even when you shoot it in broad daylight. On the other hand, too much light will make your pictures look bleach out and lifeless. To make sure that you get sharp and beautiful pictures, pay close attention to the settings of your digital camera. Most digital cameras can be easily adjusted to take in just enough light to make your pictures look perfect.
