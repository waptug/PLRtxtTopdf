Do you want to download free song for ipod? If so, reading this article could save you from getting in to a lot of trouble! Downloading music to your Ipod has more than one pitfall associated with it, and this article will tell you the best way to download free song for Ipod.

An Ipod can easily become a vital part of your life. If you had thought about the possibility of carrying around a virtually unlimited supply of music ten years ago, it would have seemed a bit futuristic, but it has all happened, and now all we have to do when we get tired of our present music collection is download free song for Ipod. This could however, be the start of a few problems…

Problem 1-
Your computer picks up a virus. You did an internet search, looking to download free song for Ipod, and, totally without knowing, you downloaded some nasty spyware or malware from a dodgy p2p site. Your laptop has now stopped working, and your Ipod is now only usable as a bookmark. P2P sites can appear to be the answer to your prayers. You can download as much as you want, many different version of songs etc, but you have probably noticed that you often download a file, and it is completely different from what it is supposed to be. In case you have ever wondered why this is, the answer is spyware. If you have downloaded from a site like this, get your computer seen to. If your computer has been infected, it can not only harm your computer, but also your Ipod. Free Ipod music download can cost you very dearly.

Problem 2-
It is illegal. It is against the law to download from a P2P site. It could lead to your arrest. It is not difficult with modern equipment for law enforcement officers to locate your IP address, and then locate you. World governments are becoming ever more proactive in combating this – it will not be long before you are found out if you are using P2P . You will have to think about whether it is worth risking prison or possibly a huge fine, just to download free song for Ipod. I'm sure it won't be worth it for many.  

Problem 3-Good quality download sites are rare.. If you search the internet for “download free song for Ipod,” you will almost certainly find endless awful sites with pop ups etc. The people who run these sites do so in the hope that you will click on their advertising, so they are not interested in you, or whether you find what it is you want. They are only interested in getting you to click on their popup ads. 

There is an answer. There really are sites that do let you download free song for Ipod- in a safe and legal way. We are now starting to see sites spring up that are a lot better organized and the good thing is that they are on the right side of the law. When you find one of these sites, you can be set up for a long time. You can have all the Ipod songs you could possibly want, and also films for all the Ipod video owners. The only downside to these types of site is that they have to charge you a membership fee, usually somewhere around $20 to $50, and that covers you for LIFE. You can download an unlimited amount of music and films, as soon as you have paid the fee. It is definitely not difficult to download more than $50 worth of music. Many people have done more than that in a day!

You now know just how dangerous it can be to download free song for ipod, dangerous to your computer, your Ipod and your freedom! You should now have a better understanding of the risks involved, and know how to overcome them.
