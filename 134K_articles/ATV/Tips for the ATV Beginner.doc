\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\cf1\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 ATV\u8217
\'92s were designed as utilitarian machines at their inception, but they have grown
 in popularity for sport and enjoyment throughout the decades. Many people enjoy
 riding ATV\u8217\'92s for fun and others race them and participate in other ATV
 events. ATV\u8217\'92s can be exciting and a worthwhile pastime. They can, however
, be dangerous but with the right experience and precautions you can safely enjoy
 your ATV. If you are a first time ATV owner you can benefit from training and practice
 and should educate your self on proper riding technique and safety precautions. 
One of the best ways to become a proficient rider is practice, but before you venture
 out there are some things all ATV beginners should do.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\cf1\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 If you
 are buying an ATV for the first time, you should probably go with a used model. 
If you are unsure that you will like the activity or just do not have great riding
 skills, at least at first, spending thousands on a brand new machine is not the
 best idea. It is better that you buy a cheaper used ATV so that you will not feel
 as bad if you damage it. After you have practiced and are a proficient you can 
buy the new ATV of your dreams and have less chances of wrecking it.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\cf1\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Beginners
 can greatly benefit form taking training courses. Training courses are mandatory
 for minors in many areas but optional for adults. They are always a good idea, 
however, as taking one can show you proper riding techniques and help you develop
 your skills. You should also make sure your training course covers safety as ATV
\u8217\'92s can be very dangerous if you do not know how to follow the proper safety
 precautions.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\cf1\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 After
 you have taken a training course, it is time to go out and practice. It is a good
 idea to always ride with someone else until you are comfortable with your abilities
. You should ride with someone who is experienced and a good rider so that you can
 benefit form watching their technique. You can even decide is an ATV is a good 
investment fro you by riding with someone else before you purchase your own ATV.

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\cf1\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 You should
 also remember to read the owners manual for your ATV and any other paper work that
 came with it. If you buy a used model that does not come with an owner\u8217\'92
s manual, look up your model online and get some basic information. Maintaining 
you ATV is also an important part of ATV ownership so you should familiarize yourself
 with all the different aspects of maintenance. Learn how to check oil and tire 
pressure as well as do an over all safety inspection to ensure you ATV stays in 
safe working order.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\cf1\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Practice
 makes perfect, so keep riding until you develop proper ATV skills. Once you are
 confident in your abilities you can branch out on your own and look into getting
 a brand new model. Always remember to follow safety precautions and wear protective
 gear no matter how confident you are.\par}
