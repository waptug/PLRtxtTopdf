In today’s technology driven society life without cell phones is unthinkable. Yet anyone who has ever looked into the purchase of a cellular phone and a plan that would go with it know that there is a lot more to the acquisition of cellular phones than meets the eye. Many of the plans are so hard to understand that comparison shopping is next to impossible while the few that do seem to be user friendly appear to have a limitation when it comes to the wireless phone it will support.

Fortunately there are many cell companies that specialize not only in the sale of wireless phones but also in the plans that will support them. Cricket itself is a bit of a cutting edge renegade in the mobile phone industry. Flat rate plans that offer unlimited United States long distance calling as well as unlimited messaging capabilities for any of the mobile phones on the market are only a few of the amazing features that today's cell phone companies offer to its customers. Customers today have the choices of many things, depending on what type of service they need. They can choose to sign agreements, to gain incentives like free cell phones with their deal or lower rates, or they can pay as they go, which was once an unheard of situation.

Of course, before you purchase cell phone plans, it is imperative that you understand exactly what it is that you need out of a phone and its supporting plan. Cricket knows the quandary that many a consumer is in when she or he wishes to buy wireless phone services and thus prior to your deciding to purchase cellular phones, the company showcases the various plans it offers next to one another so that before you buy mobile phone plans you will be able to adequately compare them. The company’s goal is to have customers who are happy with their phones, who will understand their plans, and who know how the plans will be able to grow with their needs.

Cricket helps you to not only purchase mobile phone plans and compare cell phones, but some deals actually come with a free cell phone. It is interesting to note that you can find a cheap cell phone online at a variety of auction sites, and if you are able to purchase a discount cell phone –even if it is not from Cricket – you will still be able to use the service, provided that it is an unlocked phone, such as a Nokia N91 unlocked, Nokia E70 unlocked, Nokia 770 Internet Tablet unlocked, Nokia 7370 unlocked, or even a Nokia N80 unlocked.
