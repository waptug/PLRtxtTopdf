Broadband is a recent method of getting internet access with greater speed. Now a day broadband internet access has been obtained from distinct technologies. You have to select an appropriate technology of broadband after considering certain factors like:

•  location whether it is rural or suburban
•  availability
•  Package of other services etc.

This article will offer details regarding the different technologies of broadband internet access. Some of the vital transmission technologies of broadband have been listed as:

•  DSL – Digital Subscriber Line 

This technology uses traditional copper standard telephone lines for transmitting the data with reasonable speed. The speed of this technology starts from several hundred kilo bits per second. You can get the speed up to millions of bits per second.

•  Cable Modem

In this technology, the service providers have to use coaxial cables. These types of cables are essential for delivering pictures as well as audios not only to your PC but also for your television set. These cable technologies offer you the data transmission speed up to 1.5 Mega bits per second.

•  Fibre

It is the latest technology for obtaining the service of broadband connection. This technology uses electrical signals for the transmission of data. Here electrical signals are first converted to light. The light is carried with the support of glass fibres which is very transparent.

•  Wireless 

A radio link is used in this wireless technology to transmit data. Mobile is a perfect example for getting wire free internet access. This wireless broadband access is mostly used in all hot spots like airports, bookstores, city parks etc. You can get the minimum accessing speed up to 54 mega bits per second.

•  Satellite

This technology can be considered as another form of wireless technology. The speed of upstream and downstream may get influenced by several factors like weather, the service provider etc.

•  Broadband over Power lines (BPL)

With the support of electric power distribution network BPL technology offers broadband access to your PC. It is a quickly emerging technology. Very limited numbers of people have been used this technology at present. More power lines have been installed recently to minimize the need of new broadband facilities to each one.

These are all the distinct technologies used to get broadband internet connection.
