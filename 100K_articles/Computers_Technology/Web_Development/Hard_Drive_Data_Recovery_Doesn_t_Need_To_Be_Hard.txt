Hard drive data recovery can be a difficult topic for many new computer users.  No one wants to believe that their data is lost, and most people have no idea how to get it back.  Fortunately, there are data recovery services available that can help you with the overwhelming task of recovering your lost data.  This article is intended to help you learn more about hard drive data recovery and how you can learn more.

A hard drive is a "non-volatile" storage space designed to hold data.  The data is stored on a magnetic surface which is called a hard disk platter.  There are many reasons why data can be lost from the hard drive, including the mechanics of the hard drive itself, and external problems.  Most hard drives today have several moving parts which need to be carefully synchronized in order to maintain a constant spin rate, called RPM, inside your computer.

Modern hard drives have "SMART" technology, which stands for "self-monitoring, analysis, and reporting technology."  All that means is that the computer will diagnose itself and be able to solve the majority of its problems, also that it corrects the motors and fans when needed, and lets you deal with using the computer instead of trying to maintain it.

In order to understand hard drive data recovery, it is essential to understand how data is lost from a hard drive.  Let's define data loss as an unforeseen loss of data or information previously stored on your hard drive.  Murphy's Law demonstrates only when it's too late that we should have been backing up our hard drive better.  The best way to recover data is to never lose it in the first place, but that is a topic for a different article.

Data can be lost during a power failure, because there is unsaved data in the memory which is not yet been saved to the hard drive.  Data can also be lost through a disk failure which can happen for a number of reasons, usually mechanical such as a crash in the hard drive machinery itself.  Software can also crash on your computer, especially if you are using Microsoft products, and could lead to a loss of data on your hard drive.  Viruses or other malicious software can corrupt your data and is one of the biggest reasons for data loss.  Fortunately, today's technology provides a pretty good track record on recovering data from your hard drive.

The best thing to do is to look in your phone book or on the Internet for a local hard drive data recovery specialist.  These are people who have been trained or have experience in recovering lost data and can be your best friends-especially in an emergency situation.   There are many who specialize in hard drive data recovery and are happy to help you with your data recovery problems.  The price they charge is normally a small price to pay if the alternative is losing your data forever.
