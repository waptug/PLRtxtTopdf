1. Optimum protection

Unlike coins, which are also one popular collecting hobby, stamps are more vulnerable and remain defenseless against damages and wear and tear, especially if they are on their own. This is because, as we all know, stamps are made from paper material; hence, it is susceptible to any damage even if it was unintentional or just by accident.

2. Easier handling

Generally, stamp collecting albums have two ways of handling the stamps. It could either be mounted or hinged.

When opting for a mounted stamp, you can clearly see and easily identify each stamp because they are placed in a transparent plastic casing that can be opened on both areas. Using mounts is so easy because all you have to do is to put in the stamp into the mount, and then, fasten the mounts to the pages of the stamp collecting album.

Even though they are a little costly than hinges, mounts offer better protection against moisture, dirt or dust, and air.

On the other hand, hinges refer to see-through plastics or paper with unique “gum” on a particular side of the hinge. Hinges are glued at the back of the stamps, and then, the hinges are the ones that are attached to the pages in the stamp collecting albums.

This type of securing stamps in the album is preferred by the stamp collectors if the kinds of stamps that they want to keep are those that are classified as “mint stamps.” This is because with hinges, the adhesives or the gum is easily peeled of once the hinges are detached.

3. Affordable

Most stamp collecting albums are more affordable to obtain than the other kinds of stamp collecting tools. Hence, almost all of the stamp collectors are opting to use albums, especially those who are still at the beginning stage of their hobby.

Given all that, without these kinds of protective tools, stamp collecting may have never flourished up to this point in time because stamps would have been easily worn out as time has passed by.
