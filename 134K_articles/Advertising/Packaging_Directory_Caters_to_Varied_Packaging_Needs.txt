Packaging needs are varied from the bubble packing of medicines to the huge crates for packing heavy machinery and other bulky items (some of which might just be fastened together with wires during shorter transit). A packaging directory could help manufacturers and businesses to find just the right packaging to meet their requirements.

Packaging serves not only packing needs intended to make transporting easy. It can provide sales appeal and product security from tampering. Some solutions might be better at catering to these diverse needs of packaging, compared to others. A packaging directory can help you browse through the choices and select what is suited to your products, and what is appealing to you.

A packaging directory lists suppliers of packaging materials and products, packaging machine and contract packaging services.

<b>Packaging Materials</b>

Plastics is a major packing material in today's world. Paperboard is another major material. Wood, nettings and foam are examples of other kinds of materias used in packaging.

</ul>

The sample list above would begin to give you an idea of the varied packing needs and solutions. Many of these need supporting equipment like simple or complex packing machinery, supplies such as staples and glue, and operating tools like knives, heat sealers.

<b>Packaging Equipment</b>

Blister, skin and vacuum machines provide a modern packaging solution catering to safety, security and marketing appeal requirements.

Other machineries include cartoning machines, feeding and placing machines, sealing machines, wrapping machines, capping machines and so on.

<b>Contract Packaging Services</b>

Where your packaging requirements are too small to justify investing in expensive packaging facilities, you can go in for contract packaging solutions. The contract packaging companies have specialized equipment and experienced personnel. They can help even bigger companies for extra packaging requirements during seasonal peaks, or for test marketing purposes.

Some contract packaging companies might focus on special solutions such as shrink film packaging.
 
<b>Packaging Directory Organization</b>

The task of a packaging directory publisher is to arrange the wide variety of resources and suppliers in a manner that is easy and intuitive to find. There would typically be a search box, listings of major categories, supported by listing of sub categories under each (and sub sub categories). The suppliers might be listed at this bottom level of each sub (or sub sub) category.

<b>Conclusion</b>

Packaging solutions involve packaging materials, products, equipment and incidental supplies. Contract packaging services are also available in the market where you do not want to set up (or expand) your own packaging facilities. A good packaging directory has to organize listing and navigation in a way that makes it easy to find what users want among all this variety.

This is typically done by listing major categories first, then sub categories under each major category and probably sub sub categories under each sub category. Suppliers might be listed only under this bottom sub sub category.
