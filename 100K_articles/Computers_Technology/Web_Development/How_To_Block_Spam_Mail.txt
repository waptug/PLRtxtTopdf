However, just like everything else, SCBL also has disadvantages. It also has a big possibility of filtering or blocking email unpurposedly, the mail that you want to receive.

The SCBL is usually thought of as a part of a specific scoring system. It explicitly whitelists your wanted email senders. If you use this whitelisting procedure, bounces from your system, of which are deemed to hit naïve third parties are avoided.

What Does SCBL Do?

Now you know that the SCBL is a blocking list. But still, you do not know what, exactly, it blocks. The SpamCop Blocking List is a list of different IP addresses, which send email, that have already been reported, to those who utilize SpamCop. SpamCop, in turn, is used to block and filter unwanted email.

It acts as quickly as possible for it is an automatic list of websites that transport mails that have already been reported. This includes automated reports, report sources, and SpamCop user submissions. There is no need for you to worry about delisting certain sites because SCBL automatically delists the aforementioned links when the reports end from being sent.

Blocking spam mail not only gives your inbox more space to enjoy, it also shows that you care more about the cyber world. Spam makes the Internet act slower because of its numerous links. Help make the Internet a better place to spend time in. Block spam mail now.
