Buying a PDA is not an easy decision.  There are so many things to consider and so much research to do to get your dollars worth.  You have to ask the questions.  How much do I want to spend? What do I want my PDA to do?
 
Before deciding on a PDA you should know exactly what feature it has and if it meets your particular needs.  PDA stands for personal digital assistant and it should perform exactly that task.  It should help in making your life more organized and easier.

A new PDA does not need to be upgraded annually, so it is a worthwhile investment.  It can perform several functions, some of which include address book, notes taker, GPS navigator, calculator and much more.

Given that you are ready to go forward with the purchase, your choice of a PDA model will depend on your requirements—what you want it to do. A few things to take into consideration would be the amount of memory the PDA has.  If you want to store large documents or multimedia on it then you will need something with a large/expandable memory.  The second is the size of the PDA.  If you don’t like lugging around heavy things then get something lighter that will better suit you.  The third is the battery life of the PDA.  If you want to use it heavily and still be able to turn it on then you’ll need something with an extended memory life. 

A PDA can be bought almost anywhere.  You can buy one online from just about anywhere or, you could buy one from a physical store.  I would recommend buying one from a physical store as this will allow you to evaluate both size and weight to determine whether the PDA will suit your needs.
