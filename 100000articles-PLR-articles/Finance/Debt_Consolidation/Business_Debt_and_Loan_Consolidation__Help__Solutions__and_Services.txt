There are a lot of businesses that run into financial trouble and turn to financial advisors to help develop a business debt and loan consolidation plan. As with a personal debt consolidation plan, the key to having success with a business debt consolidation plan is to stay with it until you have your finances back on track. If you haven't already done so, you need to ensure that you take some extra steps to give your business debt consolidation plan the best chance to succeed. Some of these steps may seem a bit much, but if you want to save your business from going bankrupt you'll need to make some difficult decisions.

The first step in any business debt consolidation plan is to assess just hoe many of your outgoings are essential to the business. The most important part of any business debt consolidation plan is to realise that you are going to have to cut back severely on your expenses to get your books out of the red and back into the black. Take a careful look at your levels of staffing. You should have already discussed the financial situation with your staff and informed them that you are going to be forming a business debt consolidation plan. Obviously, the staff will then realise that there are going to have to be some cutbacks, or a reduction in pay to give the business debt consolidation plan any chance of success. You may find that some of your staff decides to leave of their own volition which will have a positive effect on your business debt consolidation plans. 

Don’t be tempted to try to replace every member of staff who decides to leave upon hearing of your business debt consolidation plan but give the remaining staff the option to take on more duties or longer working hours. If you explain the business debt consolidation plan to your most trusted staff members they may agree to work extra hours for less money, simply to help you focus on your business debt consolidation plan. This will not last forever, but it is a good place to start. You can always reward your staff once you have got your business debt consolidation plan underway. You may discover that you need to cut the hours of all of your paid staff to cope with the reduction in finances that you will have available whilst you are working on your business debt consolidation plan and this is where you are going to have to put in the extra effort yourself.
