The Burn

Mr. John P. Walworth, planter, alderman, and president of Planters Bank, built the Burn in 1834. What appears from the front to be just 1 1/2 stories tall is actually a 3-story antebellum home. Since 1978 this historic home has been one of the finest bed and breakfasts in Natchez, and it continues to be a central attraction for visitors who look for comfortable accommodations in a quiet, beautiful atmosphere.

Part of what makes The Burn a premier vacation destination is their scenery. A shaded patio overlooks a two-acre garden, and brick walkways give way to camellias, azaleas, dogwoods, and lots of quiet space. The waters of a full sized pool summon one to take a cool, soothing dip before dinner.

The Burn presently has five guestrooms from which to choose.  All have their own private baths and cable TV, with access to wireless Internet and a luxurious, full-size pool.

A quaint single bed complements the ornate queen bed.  There's plenty of living space in The Lucy Room, and since it's in the main house, it's the closest to breakfast! This guest room features a dressing room and bath with a shower over the tub.

The Douglas Room is a handsome, quiet, garden level room that boasts a queen-size bed.  The room opens to the outside covered brick patio and a private courtyard with fountain. Make your way to breakfast, the gardens and pool in just a few steps.

The very ornate king size bed is the main feature of Laura's Room, which shares the upper floor with Ernestine.  There's a large bath with a shower over the tub.  This accommodation also opens to the covered balcony that overlooks our private courtyard.

Clara's Room, like The Douglas Room, is on the ground floor.  It's large enough to hold a very comfortable king size bed.  The windows look out over the garden, and the room opens to the covered patio and private courtyard.
