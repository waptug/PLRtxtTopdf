With products being introduced every day that streamline systems and work space, it’s no wonder that the all in one printer has become something of a staple in modern homes and offices. For the home office especially, the all in one printer can revolutionize a work environment, bringing unsurpassed organization and functionality to all projects.

The all in one printer executes a variety of functions including printing from the computer, general copying, scanning, and faxing. Its compact size maximizes space; gone are the multitude of machines that would be required to complete all that an all in one printer handles on its own. You will find that this greatly increases your workspace - clearing up an ordinarily crowded desk.

Of course the downside of having an all in one printer that encompasses all of these job functions is that if one system breaks, they all break to a certain extent. Having one portion of the all in one printer repaired requires you to part with the entire machine. Also, users must operate only one system at a time with an all in one printer; for instance, you can not copy while you are also scanning. If your work environment is such that multiple functions must take place simultaneously then an all in one printer may not be appropriate for your needs.

The cost of an all in one printer is really quite reasonable considering how much it would cost you to purchase all of these machines separately. They range in brand, size, and price from store to store. So take the time to shop around; you may even want to investigate online deals through the Internet. There are many office supply websites that offer comparable, if not deeply discounted prices, on machines such as the all in one printer. You may want to consider purchasing an extended warranty on such a machine, as it carries the responsibility of multiple functions.

The all in one printer, like most products continuing to appear on the market today, is meant to provide a streamlined alternative to commonly “bulky” equipment. If it fits your particular needs, you will find it to be an essential part of your home office.
