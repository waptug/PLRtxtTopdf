Open 12 raw clams to be on the half shell and do take the time to check for pieces of shell in the clam, loosen the calm from the bottom part of the shell. 

Herb Butter for clams: 

Butter 

Mince some watercress, parsley, shallots, anchovies, almonds, just a bit of garlic 

Add some Pernod wine, Anisette, and a few drops of tobasco sauce 

Mix the above ingredients together. 

Place some of the herb butter mixture on each of the clams then place a ¼ slice of imported swiss cheese on the top of each clam, if you like more cheese then just add it, place the clams under the broiler until the cheese is bubblie and brown. Now it’s up to you to enjoy it.
