Prostrate cancer is the disease which is found more in men than women. It can be cured if it is found in the initial stage, so no need to get tensed you can come out of it without any harm. 

Prostate cancer is a disease in which cancer develops in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. Cancer cells may spread from the prostate cancer to other parts of the body, especially the bones and lymph nodes. This cancer develops most frequently in men over fifty. However, many men who develop prostate cancer never have symptoms, undergo no therapy, and eventually die of other causes.

When cells in the prostate grow abnormally, they form multiple small cancerous tumors. If the cancer is left untreated, it will at some point metastasize and begin to spread to other organs in the body via the bloodstream and lymphatic system.

Prostrate Cancer: Who's at Risk
1.Age: Prostrate cancer is got to the men who are at the age above 50.
2.Family history: A man is at higher risk if the father or brother is suffering from this disease. 
3.Race: This disease is more in African American men than in other men. 
4.Diet and dietary factors: The diet in the animal fat may create for higher risk for prostrate cancer and the diet in the vegetables and fruits may decrease the risk for 
prostrate cancer. 

What causes prostrate cancer.

·	Risk increases over the age of 50 years. When the man starts growing older he gets attacked with this.  Prostate cancer is rare in younger men. 
·	If your father or brother had prostate cancer, then can get at it is at high risk increases. If they had it at a young age, your risk is even higher.
·	 High fat, lots of red meat. Countries with low fat and low meat diets
have low levels of prostate cancer.
·	Being overweight is a major risk factor for all cancers.

Treatment of prostate cancer 

Prostate cancer treatment generally depends on several different factors present in each case of the disease.  The type of prostate cancer, the size of the cancer, its location, as well the health condition of the patient all play a part in how prostate cancer will be treated.  Often, prostate cancer is a slow progressing disease although this is not always the case,  but this is no excuse to procrastinate. Cure rates are very high if treatment begins while the cancer is in its early stages, but drop steeply once the cancer metastasizes. Get tested today - no pain, much gain! 

Obviously, the sooner prostate cancer is found and diagnosed, the better the chance of recovery. Success in prostate cancer treatment will depend on a number of factors including the progression of the disease upon discovery, where the cancer is located, the age and health of the patient, and how it reacts to treatment.

Treatments other than conventional western medicine are usually considered "alternative therapies." They usually are not backed by scientific data but by years of use. Some alternative therapies date back thousands of years. These medicines do not have any harm at all they are natural treatments.
