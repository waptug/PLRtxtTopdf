Reducing Rates And Payment Amounts

Consolidating your debts into one loan can help you to reduce your rates and payment amount. Home equity or personal loans have much lower rates than credit cards. With lower rates, you can pay off more of your balance. You can also choose to reduce your payment amount with a longer loan term, but be aware that you will pay more interest this way.

A loan will immediately benefit you financially, but you can improve your credit by closing paid off accounts. As you reduce your debt ratio, your credit rating will continue to improve.

Relying On Outside Help

Several companies specialize in helping you reduce your debt. Debt management companies handle your accounts for a small monthly fee. They also negotiate lower rates with your creditors. Using a debt management plan may temporarily freeze your credit, depending on your lenders. However, most plans can get you out of short term debt in less than five years.

Another option is to use a debt negotiation company. They will work with your creditors to lower your loan balances. This will have a long term affect on your credit, preventing you from qualifying with conventional lenders for at least two years.

Personalizing Your Debt Payment Plan

A credit counselor creates a confidential, personalized budget with you. They present debt payment strategies, which can include consolidation, debt management, or negotiation. Certified counselors can also help you plan for long term financial goals, such as retirement or home buying.

Everyday people are taking action to recover from financial difficulties. While no company can erase your past credit problems, they can help you build a solid future credit score. Eliminating debt frees you from the stress of bills and limits on your credit choices.
