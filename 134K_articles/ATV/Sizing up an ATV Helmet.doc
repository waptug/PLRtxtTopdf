}Sizing up an ATV Helmet\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 The most 
important thing you can do to stay safe while riding an ATV is to wear a helmet. 
But not any helmet will do, you need to find one that properly fits you. Just putting
 one on for a minute is not enough to check for the proper fit, and you want to 
be sure you get a helmet that will protect you. There are some things you can do
 to make sure the helmet you choose is the best helmet for you and will protect 
your head in the event of an accident.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Your ATV 
helmet should be snug. There is a difference between tight and snug, and while you
 should not have to fight to get your helmet on, if it easily slides over your head
 it is probably too loose. You want to pick a helmet that gives a little resistance
 as you pull it on otherwise it may move if you are in an accident and will not 
protect you.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Your helmet
 should stay put no matter how you move. When you are trying on a helmet, be sure
 to shake your head in every direction and check to see if it moves. If the helmet
 moves at all it is not the best fit for you. The helmet should comfortably grip
 your head without pinching and should not move at all, not matter how you move 
your head.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 The ATV helmet
 you choose should not come off no matter what after you secure it. Adjust the chin
 strap and try to pull the helmet off after the closure system is secure. If the
 helmet moves off your head or comes up even a little, it is not the helmet for 
you. Either adjust the closure for a more snug fit and try the test again or pick
 a different helmet. The helmet should not move at all, even when pressure is applied
 to it, after it is closed.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Many people
 are tempted to buy the biggest helmet they can find thinking that it will offer
 them more protection. Fit is much more important than size as a properly fitting
 helmet will protect you much better than a large one. A helmet that is too large
 is unsafe and you will end up having to adjust it while you are riding which can
 cause an accident. Always go for fit, not size, when shopping for an ATV helmet
.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Another size
 mistake people commonly make when buying ATV helmets is buying a helmet that is
 too large for their child. They think a little extra room is ok since their child
 will grow into it and the helmet will last longer. This is not a good idea as a
 helmet that is too large will not protect your child now, and can cause serious
 injury. Always buy a helmet that fits your child correctly now, having to replace
 it sooner rather than later is a small price to pay for the safety of your child
. A helmet can save your life if you are in an ATV accident, so make sure you pick
 on that fits correctly.\par}
