Levy-East House


When you think of Louisiana, the first picture is of a French style of architecture. The Levy-East House bed and breakfast however is a three-story Greek revival structure. Located in the historic Natchitoches landmark district, it was recently totally restored and renovated. The antique furnishings that adorn the building throughout were in the home for over one hundred years. 

At first glance one would expect to see the plantation owner, dressed in his white suit and walking stick to be sitting on the expansive front porch sipping mint Juleps and instructing the staff in their daily duties. Each of the rooms is adorned with period furnishings and lush appointments. We have seen the outside but now it is time to check out our sleeping accommodations. 

Our first stop is the Wendy Lynette Suite. Taking center stage is the enlarged bed with the hand crocheted quilt. All the furnishings are Victorian walnut. A bed designed for royalty is matched with a marble top dresser and armoire. Enter the private bath and enjoy the whirling waters of the Jacuzzi. 

Ascending the stairs to the third floor we enter the Vintage Rose Suite. The antique walnut bed and dresser have been in the family for over 100 years. The lace curtains on the windows accent the soft ambience of the room. 

The Judy Colette Suite displays fabulous Eastlake furnishings circa 1880. A ceiling to floor crown canopy presents the antique bed in all of its finery. Also on the third floor we encounter the Cottage Suite. 

In the parlor is the television and wet bar allows a most cordial welcome to your guests. Fashioned after an English cottage we find furnishing of wicker. The queen-size bed is draped with a duvet cover and pillows and presents a view of the large magnolia tree situated just outside the window.
