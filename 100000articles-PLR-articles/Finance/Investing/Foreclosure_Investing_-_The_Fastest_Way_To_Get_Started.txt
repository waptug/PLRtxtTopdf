Foreclosure investing is actually quite another world when people have finally taken that risk and go for it. This really applies to anything else in life. Remember all those late nights where you'd stay up and watch those "how to make millions in your sleep" commercials. Or perhaps you remember all those times you went to the book store and purchased tons of real estate investment study guides.

In fact you probably have a impressive home library and collection of real estate, investment, and how to get rich quick type books by now. Some people may get a feeling of being overwhelmed after wading through those thick books and studying all the complex terminology. 

The truth is, if you are a naturally goal-oriented and self-disciplined person than you can probably achieve a full-time income in real estate within a year with the right system. So how do you choose the "right" system when everyone and his uncle says they are an expert or guru within the real estate domain? 

One thing you might want to consider doing is to align yourself with a acquaintance or relative who is already successful in real estate investment or at least in the branch of real estate that you are interested in doing. Don't be shy, definitely get in touch with them.

It may be a friend from high school or university, or perhaps even a former room mate that you knew when you were just getting started with your own life and needed someone to share the rent costs with in order to have your own place, etc. I am sure that if you brainstorm for a bit, you may even surprise yourself at how much opportunity there is in your own circle.

That is actually a very good idea- the number one way to get into real estate successfully is to have a mentor or at minimum someone that can really show you the ropes and provide feedback in real-time. No matter how well written the courses you're looking at is, nothing really compares to a trusted friend or adviser that can actually walk you through this process step-by-step.

Even if it isn't step by step, it's still great to be able to call someone up and ask for advice on what you are doing as well as to add some motivation to the process. Folks this relationship is priceless. You can save hundreds of hours of time learning things on your own, and also save thousands upon thousands of dollars in costly mistakes.

Ultimately you will have to walk the path yourself in order to learn and profit from this wonderful industry. But the initial first steps will furnish you with the momentum to be able to soar on your own two wings.
