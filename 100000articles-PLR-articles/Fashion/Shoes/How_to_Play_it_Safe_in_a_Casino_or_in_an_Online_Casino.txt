Limiting the Time You Play:
By picking a stop time before entering the casino you can control the amount you may lose. This is the simplest method there is. All you have to do is set the alarm on your cell phone for a specific time and once you hear the alarm you finish the round you are in and then you leave the casino. Leaving the casino will not only stop you from losing any more money but it will also allow you to clear your head and eventually you can return t the casino and start fresh from the beginning.


Cut Off Point:
To help make sure you do not give in to the gambling gods and fork over all your savings to the casino I recommend setting a cut off point. This means that once you hit you set amount you push yourself away from the table and leave the casino. It does not matter if you go to the bar, have some food or take a shower and a nap. Just getting out of the casino will help you regain your attachment to reality. Then after an hour or so you can go back to the casino and start over in a better state of mind then when you walked away before.


Voice of Reason:
When you are gambling alone if you should start to lose the only one who is going to tell you to leave the casino is your conscious, but then you will get the other voice in your head telling you that if you just risk more the reward will be even better when you win. If you are gambling with a friend they can tell you when you are getting out of control and can physically drag you from the casino if that is necessary. Of all the different safety nets you can use this one is the best, just make sure that your friend is a responsible gambler and that he is not a 95 pound weakling so that if needed he really can drag you from the casino.


Public Internet Access:
Many cafes and restaurants now offer free Wifi access to the internet and for those who do not have a laptop with them they will have one or 2 terminals that you can use but they are coin operated. Because they are only meant for short term use it will prevent you from sitting there and losing money for long periods of time, after a half hour or so someone is going to ask you if they can use the computer.


Gambling on the Go
Many people are too busy to be able to get away to a casino or play in an online casino, but they have the time to do their gambling from their cell phones. To help them stop from going overboard I recommend they use a prepaid cell phone which can be purchased very cheaply. These phones require you to purchase talk time in advance and when the phone is out of time until you buy more minutes the phone wont work. So if you spend more time in the casino then you have minutes the phone disconnects. This allows you to limit your gambling time and helps protect your bank account. 

Anything you can do to help keep your gambling under control is a good thing and if you are the type of person that can lose control you should definitely use some method when gambling in any of its forms.
