The process of reselling web hosting services has become very common. This involves purchasing web hosting abilities from a web host provider, and then reselling the services you don’t use yourself to other businesses. This is a great way to get the web hosting services you need, as well as a way to make some extra money in the process. The reselling process means that you use the hardware, software, and network resources of the web host provider, but you don't have to have the expertise or investment.

If you're looking to buy hosting, reseller web hosting companies can often offer you web hosting services at a lower cost with the same level of quality and efficiency, when compared to other companies. They will often offer you the ability to have more than one domain name while many web hosting providers only allow you to have one per account. As a reseller, you can often choose from several packages offering varying amounts of disk space and data transfer. It is a good investment to purchase a higher volume package at a discount because you will be able to sell it to more customers at a price that will earn you some great profits. 

Reselling web hosting services is a great way to use the internet and have your own home based business that is profitable and costs very little to get started. Some people believe you have to have a full understanding of computer programming to be an effective reseller. However, most of the web hosting providers that you resell for allow the customers you bring on board to access their 24/7 customer support technical services at no cost to you or to them. This is a great business to have as a primary income or as supplement. Some online freelancers use this resell option as a way to earn some extra money. It is simple to place an ad on your website for web hosting services.
