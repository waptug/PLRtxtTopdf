Article Body:
Satellite internet is another way for computer users to access the Internet if they do not have access to cable or DSL. Dial up is so out dated and slow that people are looking for alternatives ways to access the Internet. With the availability of the satellite high-speed broadband connection, many people in rural areas are now able to access the World Wide Web. This was not possible for many people until a few years ago when satellite started offering high-speed Internet connections to their customers. You might remember that Direct TV offered satellite television first and soon after offered its customers Hugesnet, which has a satellite high-speed broadband connection.

Although Hugesnet and Direct TV are two different companies, they work together to bring customers one solution to the high costs of cable and DSL. With DSL, you need a telephone line and with cable, you need to have their specified service package for television in order to get the Internet. Both of these options are expensive for the average user. With Hugesnet and Direct TV, you get the service you need in one package and do not need a telephone in the home or any specific TV packages. 

The high-speed broadband connection is faster than cable or DSL and costs about the same when you compare prices to additional services you need with cable and DSL. Although the start up cost might be a little more, you will still save more money in the first year by having Hugesnet satellite Internet. You need the larger dish that needs to point into the southern hemisphere without obstructions to have Direct TV and Hugesnet. The nice thing is that sometimes they offer free installation. This is true for existing customers as well, where as cable only offers the specials to new customers. 

If you need an Internet connection, you will find that Hugesnet satellite Internet gives you everything you need. You get faster speeds, which means your download and upload times are faster. If you download large files or music files, you want something that delivers the speed. High-speed Internet not only delivers the speed, but it delivers alternatives to slow connections you have with cable and DSL. Your Internet is always connected. You just have to open your browser and you are ready to go. With DSL, you have to sign into an account and then wait to connect. 

When you need the Internet and you live in a rural part of town, you can now have the Internet, which may not have been available before. You have your television and Internet needs all with one dish. The advantages of having the satellite Internet outweigh the start up cost, which some might consider a disadvantage. Your connection is always secure and you have no worries of losing your connection as you do with cable or DSL. If you need an Internet connection and Direct TV, you can have a technician come to your home to access your needs before signing any agreements. Just another service you do not receive from cable or DSL.
