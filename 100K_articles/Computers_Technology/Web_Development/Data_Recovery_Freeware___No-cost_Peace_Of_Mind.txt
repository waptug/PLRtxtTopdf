If you have a personal computer on which you use to store even the smallest amount of your work, you owe it to yourself to have a data recovery contingency plan.  As marvelous as you PC and Internet connection may be, they are still subject to malfunctions which can cause them to crash.  And there is nothing quite like that sinking feeling which comes with the realization that all your bookkeeping records, customer invoices, carefully crafted word processor documents, or personal photos are now out of reach.

The good news is that you can have a data recovery contingency plan, and even better, have it at no charge.  All you need to do is run an Internet search for data recovery freeware, study the available options, and choose the program or programs best suited to your needs.

Finding Data Recovery Freeware

Just call up your favorite search engine and enter whichever set of keywords seems the most promising.  “Data recovery freeware,” naturally, would be the logical choice, but you can try “data recovery software” free, or “freeware data recovery”--well, you have the idea.  When you have a selection of websites offering data recovery freeware, you can begin zeroing in on the programs with the features you require.

You will have to register at some of the websites offering data recovery freeware; but only rarely will the webmaster require you to pay a registration fee.  When you have registered, you will be able to download your copy of the data recovery freeware; large freeware programs will, of curse, take longer to completely download and install.  The download recovery freeware will usually guide you through the installation process.

Data Recovery Freeware Precautions

One of the things you will have to consider before downloading data recovery freeware--or any freeware, for that matter--is that freeware may only be a limited version of a similar software program for sale by the same manufacturer.  Some data recovery freeware programs may come with hidden spyware, or if you are really unlucky, a virus, but if you have the appropriate the security measures running on your PC, you should be able to catch them.

Data recovery freeware, most often, is a narrowly-focused program which addresses only one or two aspects of data recovery and would not be widely marketable.  You benefit because the owners of the freeware have not spent a ton of money advertising it so can offer it for nothing.  So just be persistent, and the chances are better than even that you will find enough different data recovery freeware to protect you no matter what!
