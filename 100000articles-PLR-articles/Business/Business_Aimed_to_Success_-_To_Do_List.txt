You need to find an ideal way of organizing and supporting your business. You can develop your own style, embrace your inner talents, find &#8220;your and only your&#8221; way to Success.

Every starting out specialist who is about to organize their own practice wants to be successful right from the start. How to do that? Where to find a perfect way to run private Biz? Does one have to spend years in order to become successful? I would say no to years and multiple business start outs.

Many people want and I say they can run their business perfectly well from the start, while continuing to develop. From my own experience, I went and I have talked to successful people. I learned about their mistakes, I put reminders for myself to achieve more at my starting level. And I did it.

They say that road to Success is hard-work. I would agree on that. 
They say that if you are not born as a businessman you have to work hard for years to get the necessary skills. Well, I am not sure about that. 
They say, this is my favorite one, that: 
&#8220;He is just lucky&#8230; He has done nothing to obtain what he has already&#8230; He has a good karma.&#8221; LOL

There is a new tendency that I accepted and followed. I started to develop habits of rich people from the beginning. My business is small and it was only in my own efforts to run it properly. I had no accountants or business advisors in my family. None of my friends had their own ventures. I had nobody to turn to. Nobody could actually give me an idea how to run my business and organize myself successfully. But I have done it anyway. Thanks to the already successful people, psychologist and business trainers who have helped me to bring out the best in me. 

I looked at them. I studied them. I worked with them. I did it all in order to fix my internal problems and fear of failure that was passed to me in my childhood. I am sure many people can relate to me. Because, our parents didn&#8217;t always know how to teach us in a better way. They were raised by their parents who have given them whatever they could. And sometimes these things are not best to work positively in our lives. Anyway, I worked through my problems, because I really wanted to be successful in my life. I was motivated to create better life for myself, my family and my child. 

Everything happened for me the moment I understood that I can be successful and wealthy only if I develop something of my own. Something that works in my life. Something that could help other people to make their lives better. 
But how to do that? How to find something of your own? How to develop and implement it in your business?

The search is actually not that long. 

You put a goal and ask yourself:
&#8220;What is my, and only my, talent?&#8221;
The answer will come to you in time. Sometimes it can take a few months, sometimes a few days, sometimes a few minutes for the answer to come to you.

After that, you take another important thing and put it to work. Your faith. 
Do you completely believe in yourself? If no, you should work on it. I wouldn&#8217;t give any advice here because every person completely differs from another. The answer is within you. The only common suggestion is to visit, once again, a successful and experienced specialist, psychologist, business trainer. Tell them what you need exactly, they will help you out. 

Do another thing for yourself. Set a specific time and date for yourself when you want this faith to appear in you and you will be ready to start doing something. Time and date will help you organize yourself better. It will make you move forward faster because you have triggered your subconscious and super conscious mechanism in order to succeed. There is a saying that &#8220;If you really want something, the whole Universe will help you to achieve what you want.&#8221;

Now, back to our Success Stairs. You have to climb them.  
Your fist successful step is to keep track of every work you do throughout a day. Believe with all your heart in everything that you do and list what you were doing in your small achievements To-Do List. That is how you will be able to keep track of what is done and what still needs to be done. That is how you will be able to gain more faith in everything you do. 

Learn how to organize yourself. Set deadlines what and when needs to be done, created or finished. Set estimated time for every work that you do. That is a key to successful time management skills.  

Make a to-do list of all your services sold to your customers. Create your own client database to keep track of your clients. Communicate with them to get to know their special needs and see if you can fulfill them and implement it in your business.


Put your computer, organizer, to-do list software to work. They will help you organize yourself better, concentrate on what your have to do and in what priority everything needs to be set. Let your organizer be your silent assistant. It will alarm you when you have to do something important step by step.

List your ideas for the future. Remember, you have to write them down. Brilliant ideas come and go. They have a tendency to vanish in our daily routine mind work. That is why your every idea, even crazy one, must be written down on paper or a computer. From my experience, these ideas accumulate and then some of them can bring you &#8220;your and only your&#8221; true Success. 


P.S. Good luck in your Business. Be successful in everything you do.
