Summary:
There are no secrets here.  Everything I cover is published in the windows help files or scattered across the Microsoft website.  Perhaps it is compiled in a somewhat more usable form here.

Windows Vista - Clean Install Tips

Perform a clean installation of Windows Vista

A couple of weeks ago I released an article entitled ,"9 Tips To Keep Windows XP Running Smooth". 

After that I published a lengthy (by necessity) article covering, "Upgrading To Microsoft Windows Vista Tips".  I have since received several e-mail requests for pointers on clean Vista  installs so I have compiled those conversations and am disseminating them for wider use. This will be much shorter and easier.

Don't let it scare you off.  Just know there are often major changes in what a computer will have and what Vista requires. 

Another warning to run the windows Vista Upgrade Advisor before doing anything else is in order.  It is located at http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/buyorupgrade/upgradeadvisor.mspx

First, Please understand that this information pertains to a clean install....It will not work for an upgrade! 

If you need upgrade help please refer to my article on upgrading to Vista at http://remotehelpdesk1.com/articles.htm 

Second, APPLIES TO THE FOLLOWING VISTA EDITIONS (YOU WILL FIND VERSION COMPARISONS AT http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/editions/choose.mspx )

• Windows Vista Home Basic
• Windows Vista Home Premium
• Windows Vista Ultimate
• Windows Vista Business
• Windows Vista Enterprise
• Windows Vista Starter

Warning:
In a clean installation, existing data is removed - that includes documents, pictures, movies, music, downloads, etc. This data includes personal data and settings. Please back up or make copies of  any and all data you wish to keep to another hard drive or computer before proceeding any further.
 
After you install the Vista operating system, you must also reinstall all programs and restore any data you moved in the previous step. AGAIN!!...Make sure that you back up your personal and business data before you perform a clean installation.

To perform a clean installation of Windows Vista, use one of the following methods only after (I can't say it enough) running the upgrade advisor, it is located at http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/buyorupgrade/upgradeadvisor.mspx

Most people don't read the fine print:  There are 23 (count them 23) warnings and exceptions hid behind this little ditty (Some product features are only available in certain editions of Windows Vista and may require advanced or additional hardware) hid at the end of Microsoft's 100 Reasons why you should upgrade to Vista.
