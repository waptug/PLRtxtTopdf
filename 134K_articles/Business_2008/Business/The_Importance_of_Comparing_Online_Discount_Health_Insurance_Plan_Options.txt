Article Body:
An online discount health insurance plan should be researched if you find the insurance costs offered to you through your job, professional association or chamber of commerce outside of your budget. It is important to find something that works for your needs as well as your family requirements.

What is important to you? Do you think you'll be needing maternity care , physical check-ups for your family, regular prescription drugs refilled or Are you considered high risk or have a health condition ?

Ask friends about the policies they use, but keep in mind that their own needs may be different than yours.

Don't pick a plan just based on your friend's recommendation but see if it will cover the types of services you require or if it may have more features than you would normally use.

One nice thing about looking for an online discount health insurance plan is that a lot of insurance companies are aware of the competition and you can compare rates to get the best deals. It is important to look via your zip code as counties even 10 miles from each other can have huge differences in the monthly premium charges. This can be based on cost of living or other factors.

When you fill out an online form you will be asked some question and it is a quick process where you can then get a comparison. They will be looking at your age, degree of risk and you can see what each has to offer in terms of the premium and benefits. By keeping in mind what services you'll be using you can make an informed decision and choose a health insurance plan that will speak to your needs. Some are comfortable for example with catastrophic insurance that would protect them from expensive hospital bills but not have coverage for doctor's visits until a high deductible is met.
