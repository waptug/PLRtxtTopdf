}Which ATV is Right for You?\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 No matter
 the reason, if you are going to purchase an ATV there are some things you should
 remember. Depending on your purpose, budget, and needs, a used model might be fine
 or a new ATV from a dealership may be a better choice. No matter where you purchase
 your ATV, you should do plenty of research before you make a decision and be sure
 to get plenty of impartial advice. Never let a salesman in the showroom talk you
 into purchasing something you will regret. Make sure you have a good idea of what
 you want, and what you need, before you set foot in a showroom.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Your first
 consideration should be the age and size of the rider. If you are buying an ATV
 for a youth or small adult, you will want to go with a smaller model for the best
 riding comfort. An average sized adult should do fine with a larger model. If you
 are buying an ATV for someone else, it is best to take him or her along to make
 sure the ATV you pick is suited to their size, its better to make sure its right
 than to surprise them with an ATV that is too big or too small and not comfortable
 for them.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 The second
 consideration when buying an ATV is your purpose. Do you need an ATV to help haul
 things around your property, to carry game in form the woods while hunting, or 
other work purposes? Are you planning to ride your ATV for fun or even try your 
hand at ATV racing? ATV\u8217\'92s vary in sizes, styles, and accessories so you
 will want to be sure you get one with all the features you need. If you want an
 ATV for work purposes, you will want to get a strong heavy ATV that is suitable
 for hauling or carrying large loads. You can get ATV\u8217\'92s that have built
 in racks for carrying equipment or game and that come with a hitch to hook up a
 wagon or trailer. If you are purchasing an ATV for fun, you will probably not need
 all those features and would do well with a simpler model. If you are thinking 
about racing with your ATV, you will want to get one that is light, powerful, and
 designed for racing. You should also get the proper tires for your ATV when you
 purchase it. If you are planning to ride in hilly, rough, and muddy terrain, you
 will want to get mud tires with deep tread that will help you to navigate this 
harsh terrain. If you are going to ride around flat ground or on trails, stock tires
 will suffice. If you will be racing, you should get specially designed racing tires
 as well.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 You should
 also consider price and get an ATV that you can afford. You do not have to pay 
full price at a dealership, if you research what you need you can probably find 
it used in your area. If you want a warranty or service after the sale, you should
 consider buying from a dealership but always compare prices and know how much the
 model you want should cost.\par}
