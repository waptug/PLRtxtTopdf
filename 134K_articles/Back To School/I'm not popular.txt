I’m not popular

	My first grade student came home from school on her first day.  I asked her which of her friends were in her class.  She named two.  I asked if she played with the other friends at recess.  She said no.  I asked specifically about one friend she had played with in kindergarten.  “No, she’s with the popular kids.”  I did a double-take and asked her to repeat herself.  I didn’t hear her wrong.  She was talking about popular kids.  In first grade.  I gave a typical mom response that was something like “There is no such thing as popular and not popular.  You are only in first grade.”  She assured me that such things did exist.
	This honestly blew me away.  What are we teaching or not teaching our children?  Why do ten year old girls get manicures?  Why do eight year old girls get their hair streaked?  I hardly believe that as parents, we look at the carefree life of our children and feel sorry for them.  I doubt we think “Oh, I can’t wait until they get a job and then come home to clean their house everyday.”  I think it is quite the opposite.  We longing wish for the days when our biggest stress was whether little Bobby thinks we are cute or not.  
	I wish that parents would pay more attention to the influence we have on our children.  Teach them to be kids and have fun and deal with their own little world.  Don’t bring them into ours.  They grow up too quickly as it is.  Please don’t push them down that road too soon.  And please don’t let your seven year old daughter act snobby so she can be popular.  Just teach her to be nice and say hello to kids she doesn’t know.
