It’s annoying, I know, but it certainly is effective. The time and energy doing the research might seem annoying but it’s always worth it in the end. Imagine being 3 clicks from the find of your life. That’s the way the classic car market works online. I must admit to being a little bit of a classic car enthusiast myself. Furthermore, I must admit to being a diligent researcher. So, when I’m looking to either buy or examine the collection of classic cars for sale, it’s not too tough. So, I’m going to give you a couple of hints of where to start looking (hint, it’s not the mighty Google. Though, Google is fantastic for a whole bunch of reasons- a high stock price not being last on the list!). 

1) Forums. This tip is generally only known to people in the know. There are a ton of forums (basically online community discussion boards) for just about any hobby that you can think of. This certainly includes classic cars. There are probably dozens, if not hundreds, of classic car forums that you can find. And the best part is that a lot of these forums allow the forum members to post live links. The links can either link back to their own sites or interesting listings that they’ve found. Face it: if you search for ‘classic car’ on Google, a few sites will pop up in the top 10. And, from what I’ve seen, they don’t change much over time. But a forum allows a much greater user base to post links to places on the internet that probably aren’t the same as the top 10 listings. 

2) Use Ebay. But not to shop. For research. Here’s trick. You don’t have to buy everything you see on Ebay. You can simply search Ebay for Classic Car and then look at the listings. Then, do a little extra effort. Visit the dealer’s website. Look at their selection. It could lead you deeper into the world of classic cars that you’d ever imagine. Ebay is way more than a shopper’s paradise: it’s a researcher’s secret weapon. 

3) Learn how the pros buy classic cars online. Without the right knowledge, points #1 and #2 are almost worthless. Learn the ins and outs of classic car buying so you can score the best deal for you money.
