Lower Back

When it comes to back pain, many people find they have it in their lower back. This area is especially vulnerable to all sorts of stresses and injuries, and it is no wonder that so many have problems. I had a severe problem with my back once, and though it cleared up thank to medical help, there are times when I know my back is still vulnerable and I have to be careful not to re-injure the same spot.

I injured my lower back by falling down some stairs. I had my hands full at my job and slipped on some newspapers that someone had left at the top of the stairs. I went down five or six stairs on my butt, and it hurt like made. However, it didn’t put me out of action and the next day I felt ok. I didn’t realize I had done something to my lower back until later. I had to do a lot of heavy lifting and it was soon apparently that something was very wrong. Putting off seeing someone about my back only made it worse.

In the end, I was in so much pain that I could barely walk. I would stand in the shower and cry because it hurt so badly. My lower back was in so much pain that there was no comfortable position I could find, and I knew I had to see my doctor. Come to find out, I had shocked the muscles in my lower back when I went down the stairs, and each day that I kept using it to lift made it worse. By the time I got to the doctor, the muscles in my lower back were in spasm constantly and that was what was causing me so much pain.

It took a few weeks and quite a few treatments, but my lower back was eventually fine. I had to do exercises to help the muscles, and had to have my spine manipulated a few times. I’m ok now, but on occasion if I don’t sit right, or sit for too long, the pain in my lower back comes back in a flash. I will have to be careful about what I do for a long time to come, and I don’t mind having to use such care. There is no way in the world I would want that pain to come back.
