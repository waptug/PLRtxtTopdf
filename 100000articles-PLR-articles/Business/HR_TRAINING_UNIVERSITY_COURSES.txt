Article Body:
There can be a number of reasons why you should undertake OSHA online training.
It will enable you or your employer to reduce the costs of training. Class room training is relatively expensive compared to online training.
It also saves time. Rather than spending time in off-site attendance of training sessions including travel, the theory parts of the relevant OSHA courses – for example, Hazwoper 40 (for full time site workers) and Hazwoper 24 (for occasional visitors) – can be completed on your own work premises without the need to travel to a training site. This is particularly important for employees taking the annual refresher courses.
It is also more efficient and effective from a learning point of view because you can choose the timing of carrying out the training so as not to interfere with other work and you can repeat online modules and assignments if required to help you revise to ensure that the material has properly sunk in before taking the OSHA test online. It is also more flexible because different employees can do different training courses at the same time in the same work area or even work from home in the evenings.It is important however to remember that online training can only substitute for classroom work and does not provide the practical experience necessary for OSHA compliance. From a common-sensed viewpoint, OSHA hazardous waste training and other courses (OSHA Safety Training and OSHA Construction Training) require an element of practical supervised work (despite some Internet sites which make claims to the contrary).
