For most of us, simply climbing and descending the stairs in our home is something we take for granted; often we give little or no thought at all to the endless trips we make up and down on a daily basis. But for those for whom the stairs are a physical challenge, the prospect of walking up or down must be approached with caution and considerable thought. Subsequently, in the event of a decline in physical fitness – due to illness, injury, or age – electric stairlifts can make the impossible possible again.

Electric stairlifts are comprised of a swivel seat that allows users to easily sit down. With one simple touch of a button, the seat travels up or down the stairs along a track. Such a system can be used indoors as well as outdoors and tracks can be manipulated to accommodate straight or curved stairways.

Battery operated stairlifts do exist – and can be helpful should the power go out. But the disadvantage of battery stairlifts is that batteries must be frequently recharged – a process that takes a bit of time. In general, electric stairlifts are far more reliable, as you never have to worry about the batteries dying – or purchasing expensive new batteries. Although experts agree that you should always have batteries on hand should the power go out and the stairlift becomes inoperable.

There are a number of electric stairlifts for purchase through reputable companies nationwide. Use online resources in order to find the system that works for your home and budget. Once you make a choice, the company will come in and professionally install the system on the stairs of your choice.

Electric stairlifts are meant to make stairs accessible and convenient for those who have physical limitations. With proper planning, you can have a professionally installed stairlift in your home, making life that much easier to manage.
