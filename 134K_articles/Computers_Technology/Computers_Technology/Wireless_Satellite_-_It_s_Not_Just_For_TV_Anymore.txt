As technology advanced forward, many of the things we've taken for granted for years are being reborn under the banner of wireless or wireless satellite Internet.  Of course, we're talking about a lot more than just receiving the Internet from a satellite connection.  Many other technologies have also obtained new life through the use of "sky birds."

Some of the most visible changes in technologies has been in communications and entertainment.  Cellular telephones use satellite services to bounce signals literally around the world.  Although cell phone service is typically within a 2 mile radius of a cellular tower, by using the power of stationary satellites, a signal or connection on a cell phone can be routed to wherever another cell tower can be found.  This is especially good news for those people who tend to be in more remote areas.

Wireless satellite Internet is a connection to the web that's available anywhere the sky can be seen.  Using a satellite to make the connection into the web holds the promise of all the web all the time, anytime.  The always on no matter where you are can be a major benefit for many people.  This feature is especially promising for serious followers of sports, sport teams, news, weather junkies, stock reports, etc.  Imagine anytime, all the time, whenever there's a computer to be able to log into you Internet connection using wireless satellite Internet services.

Another technology that falls under the umbrella of wireless satellite Internet is the whole television genre.  Companies like Direct Way and Dish Network are rapidly building infrastructure that replaces traditional antennae or cable television reception options.  For about the same price as cable-TV a clear view of the southern sky will deliver crystal clear television with all popular channels.

Movies on Demand is an up and coming technology that will literally allow you to order movies to watch whenever you want.  No more being tied to the start times of the networks, cable companies or even the satellite entertainment providers.  All movies, whenever, all the time is the driving force behind the wave of growth in this fast paced industry.
