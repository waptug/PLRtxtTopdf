Manic depression or now called bipolar affective disorder, have millions of people suffering from this mood disorder. Mood swings are but natural, but this mood disorder is way beyond the normal experiences of people. The disorder is characterized by extreme low depression and highs of an elated mood or mania. The frequency usually varies from one individual to another.

The cause of bipolar affective disorder is not yet established although experts claim that it has something to do with genetics and hormonal levels. There are also cases when other acquired illnesses of an individual cause bipolar disorder.

Everyday, a person experiences different emotions and events, and oftentimes these things trigger the mood swings. Coping up with happy events and unpleasant ones can put you in greater threat for depressive and manic episodes.

-	starting depression medicines or herbal products
-	having medical conditions like thyroid problems
-	seasonal changes
-	illnesses
-	holidays
-	disagreements between family/friends
-	work problems
-	death of family member, friend, or loved one
-	marital problems
-	starting college or a new line of work

Making your own mood chart is a tough job. It would be best to have a helpful talk with your family and trusted friends. You must also try to consult your therapist or healthcare provider. They may be able to help you more since they are not part of your life. You can better see things through their professional help.

Bipolar affective disorder is not easily detected. In fact, many people may go for many years without being diagnosed. Unlike other illnesses and disorders, bipolar does not entail any laboratory test. The medical provider will simply use the MDQ. This is a questionnaire utilized for bipolar disorder; and the person conducting such questionnaire fills up the checklist based on the symptoms exhibited by the person. However, the checklist can only be used and given the right diagnosis by a medical provider.

There are several medications that can be used for treating bipolar affective disorder, including the following:

1.	Mood Stabilizers – this medicine can relieve or delay depression and mania episodes. 
2.	Antidepressants – people having a depressive episode can use a mood stabilizer together with an antidepressant. If this medicine is used alone, the chance of switching into a mania episode is increased.
3.	Antipsychotic – persons having mania episodes can use this medication; severe mania or depressive episodes can lead to psychosis, and this can be treated with antipsychotic. You can use the medication alone or your provider can also use it together with other medications especially if the patient feels nervous or is unable to sleep.
4.	Electroconvulsive therapy or ECT – this is not actually a medication but rather a treatment to help people suffering from severe depression or mania episodes. Those individuals who don’t respond to medications can also undergo this therapy.

The ECT is a therapy and it aims to control acute depressive and manic symptoms. It can effectively reduce mood instability and cycling and at the same time minimizing bipolar symptoms and treatment side effects. Through a management plan, the bipolar patient can return to his normal life.

Although the medications are not guaranteed to remove such condition, your mood swings can be stabilized. You can effectively control symptoms and easily cope with certain problems.

Not only is the individual affected but also their families. But with proper medications and treatment, bipolar affective disorder can be stabilized and controlled. Consult your medical provider now.
