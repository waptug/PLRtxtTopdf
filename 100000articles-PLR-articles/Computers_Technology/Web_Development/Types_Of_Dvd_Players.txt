If you are contemplating on buying DVD player, have a look at the various categories available in the market, such as ENTRY LEVEL, MULTI DISC CHANGERS, PROGRESSIVE SCAN, DVD AUDIO/VIDEO, MID LEVEL, and HIGH END AND PORTABLE DVD PLAYERS.
 
The Entry Level models are less expensive than the others. Many of these models come with features such as built-in Dolby Digital Decoder component video output. The video and audio performances are generally good. They have very good picture quality. Some of the models even feature compatibility with CD-R's and CD-RW's and Decode MP 3 files. Some have virtual surround sound, to create better ambiance with just a pair of stereo speakers.
 
TheMulti Disc DVD Changers  - These models offer the convenience of continuous multi-disc DVD/CD play back and in player storage. This is recommended for those who want to integrate the CD and DVD player into one convenient space saving unit. This is a suitable choice to double the DVD-video player as a CD changer and can hold 5 discs or up to 403 discs. The model provides you with uninterrupted entertainment.
 
The Progressive Scan DVD Players  deliver a better picture. Progressive scanning allows the entire picture to be drawn at the same time at a refresh rate of 60 frames per second. These models come in affordable rates.
 
DVD integrated Home Theatre System  costs a bit more than the previously mentioned DVD Players. The hook up and setup are simple and fool proof, as it is having colour coding of the terminals and speaker wires.
 
DVD AUDIO PLAYERS  can play the new DVD-Audio format which supports high resolution 24-bit digital sound in either PCM stereo or multi channel surround sound for music.
 
MID LEVEL MODELS  have been replaced with the progressive scan and DVD-Audio categories. These models are a bit expensive, and feature better video and audio performance. All models include Component video output for excellent picture quality.
 
THE HIGH END MODELS  are highly expensive. This model represents the best of what DVD technology has to offer. To realize the higher levels of video and audio performance, a State-of-the-Art Home Theatre System is needed.
 
THE PORTABLE DVD Player  - This is a very convenient model with built in LCD display in 7" to 9" screens opens up a new world of DVD enjoyment. Some models can even play DVD Audio.
 
Apart from the above models, DVD - audio/video players and DVD -video/super audio CD Players are also available.
