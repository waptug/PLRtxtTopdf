<div class="post clear"> <p align="left"> Meet the Clintons alone in an ally on a dark night and it is believed the chance  of you coming out without getting rapped by one and cut up by the other is not very good. It certainly would not attract Las Vegas  style odds, and in 2008 they seem determined and poised to snatch defeat from the jaws of success for the democrats.<br><br>There is a reason white men, married men, and men of a certain age prefer Obama  three to one. All one has to do is take a look at Hillary. Like one alcoholic or addict knows another, one look at Hillary and,  even if you knew nothing else about her, you get the picture - you know, and the smart run for the hills while some destructive types  have to hang around for the party.</p>  <p align="center"> <b>If this is what you want...</b></p>  <p align="center"> <img src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RISsONKmL._SS500_.jpg" alt="web based pc repair - kennedy" border="0" height="422" width="424"></p>  <p align="center"> <b>This is Not It</b></p>  <p align="center"> <img src="http://well-regulatedmilitia.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/Bill-and-Hillary-Clinton--24886.jpg" alt="web based pc repair - billary" border="0" height="379" width="279"></p>  <p align="left"><br>The electorate like the online helpdesk team fell in love with Obama in part  because of his positive message... because he was above everything the Clintons not only stood for but practiced over the years. We must  ask ourselves who better reflects the politics, ethics, and work style of the 55th Speaker of The U. S. House of Representatives, Thomas  (Tip) O'Neill? That person is our candidate! And, that candidate is not a good ole boy - or girl - from Arkansas or New York  or Pennsylvania, or wherever they are from this week.<br><br>Many Americans feel Hillary is a monster. We know she and Bill don't play by the  rules. Just consider their history as well as their current push regarding the changing of the rules for Michigan and Florida to  favor them at all costs. It is all about Bill and Hill despite her claims that it is all about you... that her desire to be President is for  you. They are willing to throw anyone and everyone under the bus for personal benefit.<br><br>Obama, in the Tennessee Mountain Man's opinion, should have stood his ground.  Don't throw anyone overboard to appease perjurers. We are in the corner with Harvard professor and former  (unfortunately) Obama advisor Dr Samantha Power. Tell the Clintons to get over it and move on after all they see no issues with their  surrogate referring to Obama as Ken Starr.<br><br>Americans must decide whether they want a fresh new start in everything  politics, and whether we want someone indebted to no one but the people for their coveted position. The only alternative is gutter  politics as usual with professional politicians holding positions doled out by party bosses, paid for with dollars by high powered lobbyists, and  bought with the blood of the people who keep going to prison around the Clintons while they skate.<br><br>Remote Helpdesk 1 believes there is a reason Hillary is so divisive. She was the  "b" behind, protecting, and enabling Bill and she is the secretative "w" in her own political and public life willing to unleash her  husband as well as her feminine charms as required to bully or seduce. How many more people shall be sacrificed to team Clinton before  we make up our collective mind that we deserve better and that we can have better, and then have the intestinal fortitude to  stand our ground.<br><br>The only way to rid ourselves of the scandals of the Clintons from the past and  those sure to follow any success they have is to banish them to the trash heap from which they evolved as we did the Enron Team.  And, the only way to do that is to get past the manipulation both Clintons employ against the American people.</p>  <p align="center"> <b>If This Is Whom You Desire</b></p>  <p align="center"> <img src="http://images.virtualology.com/images/607.jpg" alt="online pcrepair - tip" border="0" height="215" width="171"></p>  <p align="center"> <b>This Will Not Do</b></p>  <p align="center"> <img src="http://uglydemocrats.com/democrats/United-States/Hillary-Clinton/hillary-bill-clinton.jpg" alt="online computer repair - billary" border="0" height="333" width="258"></p>  <p align="left"><br><br>We don't have to fear them says a web based helpdesk company... they are not  virtual viruses. They are not to be pitied... they are not the victims of vast right wing conspiracies. We all know they are not to be  trusted... they are closer to used car salesmen and their repo teams than anything. They are not Jack and Jackie and they are not  the Beatles... they are not Sonny and Cher. They are not even Ike and Tina Turner (boy I hate using Tina's name in the same sentence  as the Clintons).<br><br>Why would any sane nation return to the White House one who was impeached the  last time he held the office? Why return to the Presidency one who lost his license to practice law the last time he was in that  position for lying to a federal body? oh. oh. oh. Make no mistake - Big Willy will run the show should the weeping offended feminine  willow win.<br><br>Although he tried to rehabilitate his image during the Bush years, we know what  kind of man Bill is. If only Vince Foster were here to tell Hillary's story in his own words we might be able to determine what an  evil person she really is. Do we really want these two at the helm of the most powerful nation on God's earth?</p></div>
