How can you live like that? How can you live according to the wishes of your creditors? You must choose to do what you want whenever you want to. I don't know for you, but for me, If I want to leave Dubai right now(not in 3 months, 6 or 1 year), but tomorrow or next week, I can do it because I am debt free. I owe nothing, and nobody can prevent me to take the plane.

People don't realize, but they live like prisoners. Life is Freedom, no what your bank or creditors want you to do! You need to know yourself, and find how you can control your emotion to achieve what you want in your life with the power of positive thinking.

You need to radically increase your income.

What you need is not to get out of debt, to be debt free, or any debt consolidation service. Your real need is to earn more money. You already know that, but nobody told you to take action and how to do it.

You may think how can I do that as I am already in debt, and I don't have a capital to start any kind of business.

My answer to this is that today, there is a shortcut to be successful, and you already know it. This shortcut is Internet. Now, with the power of Internet, you can be an entrepreneur, work from your home, without risking a lot of money.
You can even start from scratch, as I did and use the power of Internet to Market your products for example. 

If you already have a website, do you know that you can be an affiliate (sell other people products), and get commissions without taking care of customer service, shipping, billing... All you need is to register in a good affiliate program, market your product, and watch the money coming in your account. 

What is the difference between you and those successful entrepreneurs? The only difference is that they tried. You will never be successful if you don't do something to be successful.

You can be successful... only if you want. You must know that success have nothing to do with luck or heredity, it is something you got to acquire through learning and efforts. It will not come by itself, you got to take it. 

“Debt isn't the real problem, the source of the problem is that you need more money.”
