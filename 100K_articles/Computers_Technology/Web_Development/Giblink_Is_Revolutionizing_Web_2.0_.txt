GibLink – Global Internet Business Link – “The time has now come for everyone to join the global marketplace and, in the process, change the way the world does business. In a world full of incredible success stories, a chapter has now been written with you in it!” This is the first paragraph on the page that describes GibLink and the words should send chills through your spine.

GibLink has combined all of the current Web 2.0 strategies under one roof to offer you a complete package for developing and marketing your business. Truly, there is something there for everyone! It took me a few minutes to wrap my mind around the concept; but, then it hit me like a ton of bricks!

MySpace, YouTube, GoDaddy or Google; what do they have in common? Well they are all giants in there respective fields. What if you would have had an opportunity to be one of the founders or initial shareholders? Do you think you would have made a few bucks for your efforts? GibLink has combined all of the elements of these companies under one roof so small, medium and even home-business entrepreneurs around the world can use gibLink to promote, advertise and expand their core business to compete in the global marketplace!

The concept is awesome; but is it possible? The internet community seems to think so! On September 27, 2007 Forbes.com said “GIBLINK Setting Records With Internet Conference Calls”, noting that over 20,000 people swamped a conference call describing the opportunity. On September 23, 2007 WebWire.com stated in a press release “The gibLink Program is a global revenue sharing and social networking system that works by using the principles of individual financial gain through group cooperation. It is the perfect business for people who are tired of spending all of their money on advertising without any sales to show for it. The internet has made an incredible recovery since the collapse back in 2000. The focus now is on the social networking business and advertising. The amount of money that is being generated is nothing less than extraordinary. gibLink is ushering in a new development to the multi-billion dollar internet explosion that is poised to rival the likes of MySpace, YouTube, GoDaddy, and Google.“

These are just two examples of the excitement GibLink is creating and they haven’t even officially begun operation. To offer an opportunity for small business owners to compete globally in the Web 2.0 environment, all in one place is phenomenal. Currently the effort is daunting to promote a business across all the internet channels. The time, effort and energy and most of all money required to successfully navigate Web 2.0 is hardly possible, let alone profitable for a small or home-based entrepreneur. GibLink offers a leveler for everyone.

Thus far, I have hardly touched the surface of the offerings of this company. For those of you in the “know” about Web 2.0, you get it. For those who don’t, you need to understand; this company is poised to compete in an untouched niche of the web; a complete offering of marketing channels previously unobtainable to small and home-based business entrepreneurs. The big names in the web game will be unaffected by GibLink; however, leveraging all of these tools under one roof should have phenomenal results for the members when it comes to results with the big players. For instance, the ability to blog in GibLink should have favorable results with its members search listings with Google. Google loves content and GibLink will have the content to give them.

If you have considered starting a home based business; now, is the time to act. Regardless of what you have considered, GibLink appears to be the vessel you need for success. You can be come a member of GibLink and offer this opportunity to other business owners and make substantial revenue from that alone. GibLink is said to be offering a unique pay structure unlike any other in the Internet Marketing world. Their motto is “No One Gets Left Behind!” Everyone has an opportunity to make money. Oh, this sounds like one of those Multi Level things, you say? Well, guess what? Web 2.0 is exactly that. A new name for the new millennium, but it is network marketing none the less. In today’s business world, networking is the way to go. Those sites where you add friends and contacts and the more friends you have, the more popular you become; sounds like networking to me. GibLink is simply offering a toolbox filled with ways to network. There has been a lot of negative press over the years about Multi-Level Marketing (MLM), mostly because the companies focused more on adding members than selling products. With GibLink the products are the things you need to build a business, websites, hosting…Oh, yeah, and networking to market your business in the new Web 2.0 environment. It all goes hand in hand.

If you have a small business and need to get the word out, GibLink is worth a look. If you are thinking about starting a small business GibLink has all the tools you need to get started and successfully market your business. If you are an Internet Marketer, GibLink has an opportunity for you to build a big organization and offering premium tools for your downline to be successful.
