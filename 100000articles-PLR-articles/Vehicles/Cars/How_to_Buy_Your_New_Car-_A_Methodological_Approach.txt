Article Body:
Choosing a car is an important decision that merits careful planning. One should take number of things into consideration before buying a car. Following these steps can make the task easier and make you choose the right car for you: Decide what you intend to use the car for daily commuting; recreation; weekends and evenings out; carrying things; towing a trailer; carrying more than one passenger; driving in the city, suburbs or country. Consider factors that are important to you, such as looks, fuel efficiency, performance, reliability and safety features. Come up with a realistic budget, based on what you can afford (consider the monthly payment and cost of upkeep). 
Locate a town or an area near your home with several car dealerships; check Sunday newspaper advertisements and the yellow pages. But the best option would be to locate an easy and good site for buying and selling cars online which will involve less effort and energy. Sites like http://www.indimoto.com are a great help.

Find a car that interests you and hop in it. Adjust the seat and mirrors, and check leg room in each part of the car. Ask to take a test drive. Start out on city streets and then head out to the highway. Pay attention to steering ease, turning radius, braking response and acceleration. Adjust the mirrors and radio while you're driving to test convenience. Return to the dealership and thank the dealer. If you like the car, ask for a business card and say you will return later. Head to the next dealership and investigate other car models as described above. Ask dealers which car most closely resembles the one you previously test-drove, providing the make and model and explaining which features you liked. Test a number of models until you decide on a car, and compare these prices with those at other dealerships.

Some important tips:
•	Inquire about availability and delivery time, especially if you're interested in a popular model or want special features
•	Factor the dealership and its sales staff into your choice. A dealership you can trust, especially one with a competent service centre on site, is worth more than money in your long future with the vehicle. You can, of course, have your car serviced at any dealer authorized by your new car's warranty.
•	Start negotiations on polite and friendly terms. Comment on what you like about the car and ask questions. The intent is to make the seller comfortable.
•	Make your first offer. It should be lower than what you're willing to pay, but not an insulting figure. Use the list price as a reference, remembering that dealer profit (often around 10 percent) is built into this figure.
•	Allow the seller to make a counteroffer. If the price is too high, say you're not able to afford that and ask him to talk to his manager.
•	If the salesperson balks at your first offer, make a slightly higher one. Continue negotiating until you can agree on a price within your budget. If you can't agree on a price, seek out another dealer. You may be able to go back and get the first dealer to underbid the second dealer
•	Avoid setting your heart on one particular model or make. There are hundreds of excellent vehicles on the market, and becoming attached to one of them may make you less hard-headed in your bargaining.
