Article Body:
When running a home-based business, a person quickly gains knowledge of how the business world works.  Whether it be selling crafts, doing a home delivery business, or selling real-estate, after investing a lot of time and effort into a home or small business, a person quickly becomes aware of the few basic business truths that govern business.

One of those truths is that you have to have time and money to start a small business or any business for that matter.  More often than not, the people that have the time don't have the money to invest in a home-based business and the people that have the money don't have the time. With Forex Trading, it is quite possible to generate an income with a small time investment per day, after studying FOREX for a few months, and a very small investment as little as $50 in some cases. 

The second truth, and these are probably quite obvious to most people, is that in order to make money a business has to have some sort of product to sell or perform some type of service.  In the FOREX world, nothing is being sold and no service is being performed, but rather money is being exchanged.  You are making a profit based on the actual exchange value of one currency against another currency.  This eliminates the need for employees, such as customer service personnel and human resource people if your company were to become that big.

Also, because of the huge size of the FOREX market, trading nearly $1.5 trillion dollars a day, such things as social events, bad publicity, and changes in political climate will have no effect on your business.  In fact, after studying FOREX, you will be able to see how these things will actually benefit your FOREX business.

The third and last classical business truth is that most people are prevented from starting a home-based business because they don't feel good enough about themselves.  They don't feel like they're educated enough.  I read stories all of the time about people that feel passionate about something or they just pick something that they are relatively good at or have done before and start a business.  They just take a chance.  If you want to do it, step out.  Take that first step.  Don't drop any huge sums of money, of course, but do a little research, make a small investment and start your adventure down to the road to FOREX trading.  You don't need a doctorite degree to get involved with FOREX trading, but after a couple of months of good study, it's quite possible to generate a significant source of cash from FOREX trading.
