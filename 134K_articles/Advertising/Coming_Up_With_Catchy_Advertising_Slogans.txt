I want to get this started off on the right foot, so there are no confusions or hurt feelings.  I am a big fan of creativity.  I think it’s so…unique.  If you have that creative energy and use it, I tip my hat to you, for you make the world a better place to shuffle around in.  Disclaimer finished, let’s get going.

Did you go to college?  Did you major in advertising?  Hahaha, really!?  Did you party a lot?  I bet you did.  Did you enter school with the intention of majoring in advertising?  I bet you didn’t.  Oh you did?  I bet you partied a lot in high school.

My point here isn’t that advertising isn’t a serious career that only a select few people can do well, because I think it is.  But, that’s the problem, only a select few people can do it well.  With that said, advertising is one of the most majored in fields in universities and the general field of advertising has come to permeate nearly every facet of our daily lives.  This tells me that a lot of these graduates are getting hired to do what they studied.  Which is funny to me, because advertising seems to be a major that everyone can at least pass.  But, once they have the diploma they’re qualified.  Or are they?  

I found an automated advertising slogan machine online.  It generates advertising slogans for whichever word you enter into the text box.  I have to say I think that it did a pretty good job.  But, can it do as good as actual studied experts in the field of advertising.  To compare I found a few slogans that were ranked as some of the best slogans in the years 2000 – 2003.  Take a look and see if you can tell which slogans an educated advertiser that makes an excellent living off his/her razor sharp wit conceived and which one was made by the automatic generator.

•Lipsmackin' Thirstquenchin' Acetastin' Motivatin' Goodbuzzin' Cooltalkin' Highwalkin' Fastlivin' Evergivin' Coolfizzin' Perpendicular.

•Reach out and touch someone

•I Wish I Were a Fuscia Weiner.

•Don't be vague.
Ask for Haig

•I Saw Strategy and I Thought of You.

•We try harder

•It's Just For Me And My Range.

•You'll wonder where the yellow went when you brush your teeth with Pepsodent

•Puts the Pickles in America


To be fair I want to reiterate that the actual corporate financed and okay’d slogans were chosen among a group recognized as the best of their respective years; whereas the auto-generated slogans were simply the first to pop out of the machine.  Again, I’m not bashing the profession or the professionals, but somehow I feel confident saying that a majority of the advertisers out there took on their most ambitious and creatively convincing efforts in their job interviews.
