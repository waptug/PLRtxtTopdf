}Getting the Best deal on an ATV Online\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\cf1\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Many 
consumers have figured out that the internet is a great place to get merchandise
 at great prices, and ATV\u8217\'92s are no exception. There are many different 
places online where you can find a great deal on an ATV from Retailers websites 
to manufacturers and even auction sites such as eBay. The internet gives consumers
 the ability to browse hundreds of different models and makes price comparisons 
easy. Shopping online for an ATV does have its own set of challenges, the biggest
 one being that you cannot test drive the ATV you will be purchasing. There are 
ways around this, however, and other things you should keep in mind when you are
 shopping for your next ATV online.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\cf1\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 One of
 the best things about shopping online is how easy it is to compare prices. With
 just a few clicks you can see what each competitor charges. You should always research
 prices yourself; do not assume that a website has the correct prices for their 
competitors even if they claim to. It does not take much effort to price shop online
 so take advantage of it. You can also check the websites of local dealerships to
 see if they will be running sales that you can take advantage of.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\cf1\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 If you
 are new to ATV\u8217\'92s or don\u8217\'92t know which type you want, the internet
 may not be the best place to start your search. Begin by checking out ATV\u8217
\'92s at your local retailer or dealership to get an idea of what you like. You 
can use the internet to get suggestions by visiting ATV forums and enthusiast websites
. You can get plenty of advice online about what type of ATV will be right for you
 and get answers to all of your questions without pressure from a sales person.{

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\cf1\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 When 
you shop online you cannot always be guaranteed that the ATV you are purchasing 
will be high quality. Shopping from an online retailer with a good reputation or
 from an individual with good feedback is one way to ensure the ATV you purchase
 will be of good quality, or at least as advertised. Do not hesitate to ask questions
 via email or phone about the ATV you are considering purchasing. If you cannot 
get an answer or the company tries to give you the run around, I is best that you
 go else ware.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\cf1\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Since
 you are purchasing an ATV online, it is impossible to test drive the ATV you like
 and get a feel for it. This is the down side to buying online, even though you 
can usually fin deep discounts over local dealerships. The way to get around this
 problem is to decide on which model you want and then go inspect and test drive
 it at your local dealership. Granted this only works if you are buying a newer 
ATV that can be found at a dealership, as you will have a hard time finding the 
exact used model you may be considering. If you are buying a newer ATV model, go
 check it out locally before you buy it to make sure you will be happy once it arrives
.\par}
