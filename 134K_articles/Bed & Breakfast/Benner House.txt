Benner House


Victorian elegance is alive and well in Weston, Missouri. Benner House is the former home of George Shawhan, the owner of McCormick Distillery. This elegant home now has the spirits of romance ingrained. Built in the lovely Victorian Queen Anne style, it is the last word in beauty and grace. 

The four queen sized suites are well appointed with all the luxuries a king or queen would ever want. Surrounded by Victorian antiques each suite is a delightful mix of the old and the new. By all outward appearances you have traveled back in time to the turn of the twentieth century. Then the CD/alarm clock brings you back to the present. Neither you nor your partner will want to leave the comfort of the big brass bed in the Garden view Suite. If the timely elegance of oak is more in line for you, then the Riverside Suite is where you want to be. For the truly romantic, roses adorn the Rose Balcony Suite. Relive the old world in the Bridgewater Suite, complete with antique Iron bed. 

Benner House is a two-story bed and breakfast with wrap around porches on both levels.  As you enter the first floor you are immediately enmeshed in the style and charm of the reception area with its original, yet restored, fireplace. Go through to the dining room and marvel at the Murano Venetian Chandelier. The solarium has floor to ceiling windows that accent the Rattan and white wicker furnishings. There is even a library with a large variety of reading material and games as well as a large color television. Early risers can stroll through the hospitality Bistro and marvel at the tin ceilings while enjoying their morning coffee. Here you will truly see the European touch with the grapes and wine decorations.
