Traits of Aquarius

Aquarius, the water-bearer, is ruled by both Saturn and Uranus, and the two planets give Aquarians a unique disposition.  Thanks to Saturn, those born under this sign have a knack for being cool and level-headed.  Uranus, on the other hand, directs them to be unconventional and unique.

Aquarius is a humanitarian, there’s no doubt about that.  The Aquarian likes to make a difference, or even just spend lots of time discussing it, since they are also idealists and dreamers.  They also have a flair for logical thinking, which greatly helps to support their arguments.

Aquarius hates hierarchies, and refuses to be placed on a pedestal.  Their logical, analytical minds are perfect for logic and computer work.  The areas they won’t do well in are “fuzzy” areas, like brokering deals or making sales.  They much prefer the hard and solid world of the computer, or the much more satisfying world of social work.  Nothing annoys them more than the idea of choosing a career solely for the money it offers.

Sagittarius and Aquarius have one thing in common:  a disregard for social manners.  While Sagittarius feels manners are pesky little details he has little patience for, Aquarians think manners are elitist, or perhaps even hypocritical, and deserve to be ignored.  They speak what’s on their mind.

Aquarius has a reputation for being emotionally unstable.  They tend towards sensitivity, with a thin skin and touchy attitude, especially when criticized.  Also, they have a deep-seated fear of rejection.  Many Aquarians find it easier to write their feelings rather than talk about them, and on paper, the sensitive and passionate nature of Aquarius can shine past the cool and calm façade.

Aquarians are the most attractive sign of the Zodiac.  They also like bizarre colors, weird accents, or provocative style.  This is Uranus’ influence, driving them to be unique.
