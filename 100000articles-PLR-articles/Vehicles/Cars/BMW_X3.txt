Article Body:
I’ve wanted to write something about BMW X3 especially when I read in some newspapers that X3 is the best sell in Europe. It is a little bit strange rough estimate, with a price almost the same like X5 and with a roguish attitude, but X3 was transformed in a big success.
 
Most of BMW engines are amazing and Europeans are going nuts when they hear about BMW, much more when the suspension remind us of a limousine. Practically, if we take a good look at the price, we will be able to observe that the only strong and real rival for X3 it is X5. But X3 is more a tall break car than that small SUV on which all buyers are dreaming. 
 
And the fact that the car was receiving a facelift, before the new X5 will be launched is another proof of how much the German constructor care about this car! I don’t say that the facelift is very spectaculars, the car only gets to be more aggressive.
 
The interior is beautiful: the edge, interesting steering wheel, everything let you know that <b>you are in a <a href="http://www.carsandtuning.org/cars/bmw/">BMW</a></b>!
 
If you want to buy this top car you have to know many other things that under the 3.0 SD capote you will see the newest diesel propeller from BMW. I really think that this engine is something that you can’t disagree and it deserves all the credits! And we have to recognize that the constructor worked very hard to obtain this beauty!
 
X3 3.0 SD gets from 0 to 62 mph in 6.6 seconds and has a top speed of 240 km/h. And that because the engine develops 286 hp and a maximum torque of 580 Nm starting from 1,750 rpm. What is more interesting it’s that the Variable Twin Turbo technology and this “stage supercharging” (everybody is talking about it) permit that the torque gets to 4,400 rpm without harming the car.
I don’t know what do you think, but I surely believe in this car and in it’s capabilities and performances!
