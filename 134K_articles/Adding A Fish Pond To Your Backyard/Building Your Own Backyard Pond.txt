BUILDING YOUR OWN BACKYARD POND

A Landscape Masterpiece

A backyard pond is the kind of structure that can turn
your average backyard into a landscape masterpiece.
The pond is sometimes considered to be the centerpiece
of a yard. As the variety of inexpensive kits
increases in the gardening market, backyard ponds have
become popular to the public. Backyard ponds were a
luxury for only those who could afford it in the past.
However, with the current facilities available and
some effort from the home owners, building that
perfect backyard pond has become a luxury for all.

Unfortunately, in the rush of home owners to integrate
ponds into their home landscaping, several do-it
yourselfers have made mistakes. Building a pond is not
as easy as the market has made it to be. There are
several important factors to take into account before
and during the construction of the pond. The following
are some guidelines on how to build that perfect the
smart way. Remembering these key points will help in
reducing those mistakes that do-it yourselfers usually
make.

Tips and Tricks

First, let your backyard decide. The first question
that comes to mind is where to make the pond? In most
cases, home owners just find an open spot in their
yard and immediately start working. The result? Still
your own plain backyard with a pond. Home owners have
to integrate the pond into their existing landscape.
The pond will fail to compliment the overall design
and feel of the property. In situations like these,
the presence of a pond can actually diminish the
beauty of a home landscape

When considering in constructing a pond, take the time
to pick out a design and suitable spot that will
flatter the over all design of the yard. Don’t just
simply grab that shovel and dig on the first spot you
can find. Do a little research and if you still feel
that your own judgment and unique design is not
enough, ask some friends or your family members to
help you out. Remember two heads are better than one.

Second, consider the elements of your backyard. If you
are considering on breeding fishes, you may want to
rethink about placing that pond in a shaded area.
Warmth is an important element in maintaining fish
population. If the pond is placed near a tree, you may
find yourself in a position where you are constantly
cleaning leaves off the pond. The environment
surrounding your backyard will have a great impact on
the appearance and maintenance of the pond.

Lastly, size does matter. You need to make sure that
the size of the pond will meet your goals. Some may
build a small pond and place a variety of aquatic
plants and animals only to find out that the pond
cannot satisfy the necessities of the plants and
fishes. Another thing to consider carefully is the
depth of the pond. This is especially true for
landscapes in colder climates and ponds containing
fish. If the pond is built too shallow, it could
freeze completely. Proper depth should also be
considered when talking about size.

Building a backyard pond in you home can definitely
make it more attractive. It is a great way of making
out door living more colorful and enjoyable. If built
correctly, it can add a certain luster to the beauty
of a property and can raise the property’s value.
However, if done poorly, your backyard pond can be
incredibly stressful.
