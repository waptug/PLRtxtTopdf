In truth, with all the information needed to trade forex, it would be silly to initiate trading without first getting educated to some degree.

Choosing education can be tricky as many people are willing to take your hard earned money for minimum amount of basic Trading advise, which can normally found for free on many sites. However there a few sites that will actually take a novice and show him how to trade forex up to a professional level. 

Forex Trading courses will usually teach a little Fundamental but concentrate mainly on technical analysis, teaching investors on how to read charts, and understand indicators to placing trades and understanding the importance of money management .

These online Brokers also incorporate free charts with live streaming information normally for free, in hope that when the customer starts trading for real they will upgrade the account with them. If used properly these demo accounts are also a good educating tool, mistakes can be expensive in Trading, a wiped out demo account can be a bit of an embarrassment but less painful in the pocket if the account being used only contains virtual money.

Trade a Demo account properly with the right education and a novice trader should see their account get bigger and bigger which will give them the confidence to start trading for real. 

A large amount of traders who dont use demo accounts will wipe out their real account in the first few months, many never to be seen again. A trader spending a little on education first, will no doubt save money and stay in the game longer.
