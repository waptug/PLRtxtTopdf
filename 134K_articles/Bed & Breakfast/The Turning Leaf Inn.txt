The Turning Leaf Inn

Deep in the mountains of Southeastern Oklahoma is a mountain lake bordered by national forests, state parks; clear running streams and the sort of seclusion that has to be experienced to be accurately treasured. Beaver's Bend Getaways is a gathering of privately owned top of the line cabins offering modern amenities in relaxed settings and just minutes from outdoor fun! Tucked among the cabins is The Turning Leaf Inn.
The focal point of The Turning Leaf Inn is a ample, relaxing rear porch, ideal for star gazing in the hot tub or enjoying the splendor of the out-of-doors.  A scrumptious breakfast served in your room, at the table, or out on the deck is included.  And to top it all off, homemade desserts are delivered to your door in the evening. 

Situated on a gorgeous wooded acre, only minutes from Broken Bow Lake and Beavers Bend State Park, the Turning Leaf Inn is one of the most recent places to stay alternatives in the area.  Featuring two suites with king sized beds and two standard rooms with queen sized beds, the Turning Leaf Inn offers comfort and silence unlike anything you've experienced.

The Oak Suite brings a mix of reds, golds and browns and swirls them together to generate an ambiance that invites you to stay a short time.  The tall, dark sleigh bed, private porch with a welcoming swing, and private bath with a shower and Jacuzzi tub makes this just the place for a romantic couple's getaway. The Oak Suite also boasts a private sunroom of its own with a luminous gold snuggler chair and a tall bistro-style table for two.

The Pine and Willow Suites share a bathroom and are perfect for two couples or family groups.  Whether you are a couple looking for privacy or a family looking for a cozy getaway, The Turning Leaf Inn has something for you.
