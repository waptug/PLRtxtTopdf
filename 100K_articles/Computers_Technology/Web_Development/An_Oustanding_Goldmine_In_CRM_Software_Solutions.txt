Every year, without fail, the GoldMine CRM (customer relationship management) software solution has managed to grab an award or two from various organizations in the field of CRM and computing.

In the business software category of VARBusiness magazine by CMP Media, GoldMine software was one of only five products recognized by the magazine. The magazine conducted a survey to figure out what products where relevant to mid-market business establishments that employed between 100 and 999 employees. Out of the 350 nominations that were cast, only 45 products were selected to represent several categories. In comparison to the previous year where GoldMine was way behind in the top 100, jumping to the top 45 is a big leap indeed.

GoldMine was also cited by ISM Inc., as one of the top 15 CRM Small & Medium Business Software Award for 2006. Coincidentally, this is also the fourth consecutive year that GoldMine has been given the honor of being included in the awards list.

In the year 2005, GoldMine software was given the CRM Market Leader Awards for Small Business by CRM magazine. The CRM Market Leader recognizes those vendors who have excelled in eight industry categories. Recognition is based on weighted criteria that include revenue, growth, market share, reputation for customer satisfaction, depth of functionality, and company direction.

Also in 2005, GoldMine received the CRM Excellence Award from Customer Interaction Magazine. According to the magazine, GoldMine software was given the award to show recognition for the way GoldMine products and services have substantially improved the processes of their clients’ businesses by streamlining and facilitating the flow of information needed for companies to retain their most precious asset...their customers.

GodlMine software is a recipient of numerous accolades and awards from various publications and organizations involved in the CRM industry. This fact reflects the dedication of the countless numbers of people who have contributed to the evolution of GoldMine software at one time or another. The results of their dedication to service and product excellence can be seen not only from the awards received, but also from the thousands of success stories of businesses from around the world.

The successes of these businesses prove, more than the awards do, that GoldMine does indeed know what it is doing by increasing customer retention and satisfaction rates of their numerous client companies; and that is the bottom line.
