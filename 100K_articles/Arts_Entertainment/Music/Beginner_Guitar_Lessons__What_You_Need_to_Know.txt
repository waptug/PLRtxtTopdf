If you are looking for beginner guitar lessons online it takes a bit more precaution than having private tuition at a local guitar centre or home visit. Online guitar tuition is an increasingly popular way to pick up the instrument, and to learn how to play competently.  So you should always look for a book or piece of software that has been well reviewed, has good testimonials and has a 100% money back guarantee. 

Online guitar lessons are much cheaper and, many times, your introductory lessons are even free.  Online guitar lessons offer way more bang for the buck.
Online guitar lessons are made to allow you to have a great time while you are learning to play the guitar. 

I would also recommend that you take a look at some of the free lessons available but beware, they are very limited and the quality is often so poor it actually ends up confusing and slowing your guitar skill development dramatically. By all means, take some free advice but please be weary of any website that sucks you into giving email address for "unlimited free lessons" or similar offers. 


Just remember, a free lesson is ok but it is unlikely that any real guitar professional guitar teacher out there is likely to want to just give up all their years of experience for free, forever! 

If you are considering offline methods then that’s a good option as you will avoid many of the scams online. Guitar lessons that are taught by a professional aren’t always easier and more effective to you as well.  Some Guitar lessons can cost up to $30 per hour or more, Lesson fees can soon add up, and are impractical for most people.  Guitar lessons are only as successful when people are committed to making them successful. 

However, the downside to this is that it can become very expensive very quickly and you will always have to rely on someone else's teaching schedule. Online guitar lessons give you the flexibility to learn when and where you want, at your own pace, using material targeted just for your needs.  With proper online lessons or learning material it is always there at your disposal night and day, whenever you want to take your guitar skills to a new level!
