Others would dismiss these as pre-occupations of the rich and wealthy. Some even think of these as the plaything of stockbrokers, bankers, and finance people.

Assets, asset management, asset recovery, asset protection, asset tracking and asset evaluation are easily understood if you know how they work together. Assets are your material and physical possessions. These include your lands, real estate, money, jewelry, stocks, and every source of your income. Asset evaluation simply means putting value on your assets. This entails finding out how much all your assets are worth and the evaluation also probes if your spending habits are still within your assets' value. Asset management refers to how and where you invest your assets (think: stocks, bonds, real estate) where they can yield the highest returns possible. Asset recovery is the means you take to get your investments back; for example, when someone rents your property, the rent is your means to recover your asset. It's also the same thing when somebody borrows money from you. His payment and interest enables you to recover your assets. Asset protection are the measures you take to prevent the losing your assets. Insurance policies and contracts are common means of asset protection. Asset tracking obviously is a system you adapt to track your assets. Through this system, you map your assets, cash flow, and income returns. It is also important that this system allows you to identify which assets are making the most money and which of assets are in danger of loss. With these key factors, you can be capable and adept in taking charge and managing your assets.

However, if you're still unsure facing the world of assets, asset management, asset recovery, asset protection, asset tracking and asset evaluation, here are some guidelines. Your strategy must depend on assets' value, your income, age, and portfolio. Your risk appetite is also a big factor.

The larger your assets, the more it is needed to allot time to manage it. Search the web for online tools and asset management software to guide you in taking charge of your money and assets better.
