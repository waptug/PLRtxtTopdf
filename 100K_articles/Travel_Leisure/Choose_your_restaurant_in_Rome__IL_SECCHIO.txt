Choose your restaurant in Rome

Choosing a restaurant in Rome can be not so easy, filled as the Eternal City is with hundreds of excellent places. The good news is that it's rare to get bad food. The even better news is that we've narrowed down your choices. Our restaurant il secchio   has a wide range of  flavours of the roman food.
Rome is not only the capital of culture, history, art and charme: Rome is also the home of Italy's most delicious ingredients.

Roman meals normally include at least three separate courses: pasta, a main course (usually a meat dish with vegetables or salad), and dessert. Meats, though tasty, are definitely secondary to the pasta dishes, which are generous and filling. The wine is so excellent (especially the white Frascati that comes from the nearby Castelli Romani) and affordable that you might want to do as the Romans do and have it with both lunch and dinner.




In addition to the restaurants located around your hotel in Rome, consider visiting our restaurant in rome that cooks the original roman cooking called " cucina romana".

Despite a sudden rise in prices after the adoption of the euro, Rome's dining tabs are still generally reasonable. One important tip: Check before if  your restaurant in rome is open, because days off and vacations can spoil your dinner in Rome.

And remember that family-run trattorias are an extension of the home table. Do not forget to enjoy with your family  a very intimate atmosphere tasting the  roman food in my restaurant in Rome.
