The Beneficial Properties of Chinese Herbal Teas

The caffeine-free alternative represented by herbal teas is one of the well-known benefits Chinese herbal tea offers. Additionally, many of them are attributed with very soothing and comforting effects. Rosebud and Chrysanthemum herbal teas are two of the more popular examples of them.

Rosebud and Chrysanthemum teas are considered in China to be a woman's herb. They are, however, also useful for aiding digestion. Even a hard-core tea drinker is sure to enjoy the fresh floral flavor of these miniature rosebuds. Chrysanthemum tea has long been used to cool the body and reduce fever and has a particularly unique flavor.

Due to the lack of caffeine, Chinese herbal teas are great beverages to have when caffeine would be avoided, such as at night before bed.
