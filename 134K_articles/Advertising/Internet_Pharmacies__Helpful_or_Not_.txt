The advantages mentioned above do come with its negative aspects, these disadvantages include:

    * Identity theft.  Other people may use another person's identity through the personal information entered in the online medical questionnaire supposedly used by internet pharmacies to diagnose and prescribe medications.

    * Knock-off medications.  Illegal internet pharmacies may send out counterfeit drugs, out-of-date medications, or drugs in incorrect doses.
    * Serious drug interaction.  As these online pharmacies do not require a valid prescription, they may sell you medicine that may cause a serious drug interaction or trigger an allergic reaction.

 

With all the pros and cons laid out to you, here are a few tips on how to distinguish a good internet pharmacy:

    * Contact your local pharmacy board to determine if the internet pharmacy you're going to order from is licensed to dispense medication in your state. 
    * Have a physical check up to have a proper diagnosis of your condition and an valid prescription for the medication you're going to order online.
    * Look for internet pharmacies that require a valid prescription before processing your order. Even an expert doctor won't be able to come up with a precise diagnosis by just reading a medical questionnaire.
    * Look for online drugstores that offer the service of a licensed pharmacist to assist in you with any queries or concerns regarding the medicines.


Even if online pharmacies offer a lot of convenient features, there are a lot more things you need to consider than just that.  Your safety and your health may be put in jeopardy just because you thought a short trip to the pharmacy was too much of a hassle.
