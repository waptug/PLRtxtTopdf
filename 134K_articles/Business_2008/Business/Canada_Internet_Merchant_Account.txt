If you knew that a Canada Internet merchant account could dramatically improve profits and reduce overhead costs, would you get one? Well, the good news is that it can and you should! A merchant account conveys a host of benefits that can help your business expand to meet the demands of today’s time-conscious consumers. To apply for your merchant services account, simply follow the following easy steps. 

1. Apply for a Canada Internet merchant account through a reputable banker, loan agent, or financial underwriter. You may be able to work with a banker with whom you have already established a business relationship. Or you can shop around for a better deal if you feel your bank is asking too much money for too few benefits. These accounts can be quite competitive, so it pays to browse a host of providers in your town or on the Internet, where financial offers are waiting for your perusal. Just do a search for merchant accounts or merchant services, and you will soon find that a number of potential lenders will pop up on your screen. You also may want to get the names of other financial institutions from colleagues, friends, and family members who already have successful merchant accounts. 

2. Check out possible Canada Internet merchant account providers by running their names through a business checking service, like the Better Business Bureau. While this is not a comprehensive background check or a certification of the lender’s ability to meet your needs or keep its promises, it does provide a starting place for ensuring that the provider is not a total fraud and may be somewhat likely to live up to its promises. You also can check out online testimonials or ask for references. If the company has a longstanding history of providing merchant services, there is a fairly good chance that it will work out well for you, too. 

3. Browse available services offered by Canada Internet merchant account providers. Perhaps the most sought-after benefit is the ability to offer credit card payment processing services to clients who shop at your Internet site. Find out how much this service will cost through your choice of Canada provider, and determine whether the benefits are worth the asking price. You may end up paying some of the expenses yourself, such as a domain registration and site-hosting fee, but this is to be expected from just about any provider. It is important to compare fees among various lenders to get the most affordable package. Some underwriters will ask for an application fee or an annual membership fee, as well as several other types. Look for the lowest available costs before deciding on the provider you want to work with. 

4. Find out which services will by covered by your choice of Canada Internet merchant account underwriter. Some companies may provide free monthly statement printouts while others charge for this service. You also need to check service rates, which typically are billed by a few cents per transaction or via a low monthly interest rate. Set up your company budget and evaluate your customers’ buying patterns to figure out which billing method will work most in your favor. 

Finding the right underwriter will help you to maximize your Canada Internet merchant account.
