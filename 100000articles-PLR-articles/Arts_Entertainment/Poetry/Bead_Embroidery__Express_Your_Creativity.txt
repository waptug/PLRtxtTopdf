Anyone who takes a single look at beads will realize that in order to create a work of art from these tiny materials, you need to have a lot of patience and creativity. 

It will probably take a very long time to finish a moderate sized design, particularly if you are beginner in the art of bead embroidery. However, it is kind of exciting to watch the design unfold on your fabric while you work on your bead embroidery.

If you do not have an idea of what design to make, it will probably be a good idea to imitate a pattern from a drawing to make sure that your work does not turn up to be a mess. You can also trace a design onto your material with washable ink. As you grow accustomed to the process, you will be able to create your own bead embroidery designs with no trouble at all.

Pieces of clothing with bead embroidery are now considered to be very fashionable. They display your uniqueness and creativity to the world. 

Bead embroidery is also a fun way to recycle your old clothes. If you have an old tank top, for instance, that still fits but is starting to look quite boring, you can easily spice it up with a little bit of bead embroidery, and it will be just as if you bought yourself a new outfit.

When you are planning to start a bead embroidery project, make sure that you have the appropriate tools necessary. For example, check that you have the right kind of needle for the particular size of beads that you will be working with. Also, set aside enough time to do the project because as mentioned earlier, bead embroidery is not a 5-minute endeavor.

Practically any sort of bead may be used for embroidery. The ones that make the most intricate details, though, are the smaller kinds. The smaller the beads, the more design possibilities you will have. 

You must keep in mind that smaller beads require more skill and greater patience as it will take a longer time to finish if you are working on a rather complex design.

Once you get the hang of it, you will find out that bead embroidery is not so hard after all. You might even enjoy it so much that you can actually start your own business making customized bead embroidery. Many people have found this business to be quite profitable, since the beads do not have to cost a lot.
