Nearly everyone in the western world either owns an artificial Christmas tree or ventures out to purchase a real fir tree every Christmas period. Parents and children alike all love to decorate the tree with ornaments. Originally the traditional Christmas tree ornaments consisted of dried cranberries, popcorn, lollies and candles but today the typical Christmas tree has somewhat evolved and the ornaments that adorn our trees are somewhat different.

These days it is possible to purchase an enormous variety of decorations, with the subject being anything from a favorite hobby, television show, cartoon character or other unique topic. Many people spend lots of money on their unique Christmas tree ornaments and often collect extra ornaments to give to their children when they leave home. I know from my own experience that my three children all love the special Christmas Angel that we place on the top of our tree, and each and every one of them comments on how they would love to have this special ornament when they finally leave home. I expect that it would be impossible to find 3 of these Christmas Angel so they will be disappointed to hear that the one we have will be staying put.

Christmas Tree Ornaments Highlight Special Moments In Our Lives

Many Christmas tree ornaments, just like my own Christmas Angel, have special significance to heir owners, for example our favorite Christmas tree ornament is quite old and was originally made by my grandmother, however, these days it is possible to buy some quite sophisticated Christmas tree ornaments some of which can light up, play tunes and even move about.  

Popular Christmas Tree Ornament Company Creates Thematic Series Upon Which To Build Collections

There are many manufacturers of these beautiful products, some of which specialize in creating collectible Christmas tree ornaments. Each year they release another piece to add to the series.  For many collectors this has proven to be a very lucrative pastime, particularly if you are able to predict which series of Christmas tree ornaments will be in demand in the future. An example of the increase in value of one series of Christmas tree ornaments was the very popular rocking horse series that began in the early 1980’s. The first rocking horse, issued in 1983 which cost less than ten dollars, is now being sold on ebay and other online auctions for up to US$500 each.  The rest of the series does not attract those kinds of bids but are still sold well above their issue price.  

Yard Sales Often Contain Treasures If You Know The Value Of Collectible Christmas Tree Ornaments

For many garage/yard sale and resale customers, their goal is to seek out antique and collector Christmas tree ornaments at estate and home sales across the country.  Finding a “diamond in the rough” such as a Christmas tree ornament that “no one wants” for sale at the price of a few dimes can become a goldmine if you know its value on the resale market.  For many collectors, it is just this type of motivation that moves them into buying and selling unique Christmas tree ornaments on the web.

So keep your eyes open the next time you go to a garage sale - you might just be lucky and find some unique and collectible Christmas tree ornaments for a few dollars and laugh all the way to the bank.
