Planning for your retirement is obviously a good idea. The phrase "the earlier, the better" describes what your policy should be for handling your transition from a harried work life to your relaxed golden years. At best, take twenty four to eighteen months to prepare for this significant change in your life. 

* Cleaning Up - Try to pay off any outstanding debts or fiscal responsibilities before moving on, especially those that are hedged against your retirement plan. If you don't, you'll probably be paying them out of your pension/savings and that is an incredibly bad idea for a retired individual. 

* Doing the Paperwork - A year before you retire would be a good time for you to start doing the necessary paperwork for your retirement. Birth certificates, passports and other identity papers should help smooth your transition to a senior citizen. 

* Health Care - Always check with the employee benefits department six months to a year before retirement. Ask them how your health insurance will change once you're not a member of the company. Depending on the answer, you may have to look around for new or additional insurance for yourself. Also, take into consideration any continuing ailments that you may have. Covering them with health insurance is a good idea, since they may take out a significant part of your retirement income. 

* Budgeting For Yourself - Check what your income sources will be after retirement. This can be from your employer - with the company's own pension plan, Social Security and your own personal savings. After that, make a budget that would fit your approaching financial situation. You really need to do this well in advance, so that you may be able to change it for any required adjustments such as paying for new medical insurance and other expenses that may pop up. A year should give you a large enough margin to prepare. If you're having trouble balancing it all, a financial advisor is a good investment. Try to find one that has a good solid reputation so as to avoid any problems. 

* Making a New Tax Payment Plan - Switching from your salary to your retirement income is a big change but you still have to pay taxes for that change. After retiring, contact your tax advisor on what forms you'll have to submit and how to set up a good payment plan so that you'll be able to maximize what you can out of your payout from retiring.
