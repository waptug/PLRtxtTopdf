www.Ratestogo.com is a last minute booking portal which is focused on giving the best deals for hotel room bookings anywhere in the world. As compared to similar portals such as Lastminute.com from the UK, this portal does not cover a wide range of products, but prefer to concentrate on the hotel market niche. In fact, its home page does not contain many advertisements but provides a series of list boxes that allows users to input their query for the hotels within their target destinations. Additionally, there is also a list of featured hot deals of hotels that provides quick links to the visitor.

This portal is also a wholly owned company of Cendant Corporation, an international conglomerate that also owns other travel portals such as www.Cheaptickets.com and www.HotelClub.com. With this, Ratestogo.com is therefore part of a huge organization that consists of 5000 employees over 116 countries. This travel site which was launched in 2002 and operated by Flairview Travel Pty Ltd showcases great hotel deals of more than 8500 hotels within 36 countries in the world.

Before users can place a booking, they must first register with the site, either through an online registration form or by making a confirmed reservation through the home page of Ratestogo.com. Registration is totally free and users are entitled to accumulate Member Dollars that are claimable for discounts, as well as an option to receive newsletters featuring special offers or updates. 

Next, the user will need to make a selection on the check in and check out dates, the target city and suburb, in order to run a search on the available hotels in the area at the specified dates. A list of hotels will appear accompanied by short descriptions and starting prices on a left text box of the home page entitled Today’s Hot Deals. Select any one of these hotels listed and a new window opens, providing full details of the selected hotel, the room type and corresponding prices, the consumer rating of the hotel as well as pictures of the hotel. 

Then, in order to make a booking selection, click on the red Book Now button which is located within the listing of room types and prices table, and a new page will be loaded requesting the user to input the number of rooms to be booked as well as any additional requests for the booking. Clicking on the continue button at the bottom of the page will lead the customer to the booking confirmation page that lists out all the details of the reservation, as well as a section that prompts the customer for their credit card information and guest information.

Once credit card information has been processed, the booking will be automatically sent to the hotel. This is why reservations at www.Ratestogo.com are conducted through real time bookings connecting them directly to the hotel reservation system. Through this process, bookings are confirmed instantly and a booking voucher will be automatically sent to the customer’s email address. This way, all the customer has to do is to print out the voucher and present it to the hotel during check-in. That’s how simple booking a room from Rates To Go is!
