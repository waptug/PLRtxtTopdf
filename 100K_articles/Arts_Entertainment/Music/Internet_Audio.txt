Article Body:
The main reason for the popularity of MP3 format is due to the fact that it puts music into manageable files that can be easily downloaded over the internet. This is why, numerous music files are turning to the web in the form of mp3 tunes. Many of the home and car audio accessories and portable players consist of the mp3 format in one way or the other. 

<b> How mp3 works </b>
Mp3 is a digital audio codec that can easily compress and decompress digital sounds in much smaller size and therefore is easily downloadable through internet.  Mp3 codec works by removing some portions of the original signal that are determined to be essentially inaudible or a technique called “perceptual coding.” Perceptual coding are “lossy” forms of compression where some frequencies in the original signal are lost during the encoding process and can’t be restored in playback.  But despite of this lossy nature, mp3 can deliver the nearby original music quality. 

<b>Playback options available in mp3 </b>
As the mp3 files are created with the process of “encoding” they could be play backed with the use of proper decoding. Mp3 decoding is available with many computer applications and other types of A/V gear.  Some ways to play back mp3’s are:

<b>1. </b> Personal PC 
 You can playback mp3 on your computer with music management programs such as jukebox that easily decodes different audio formats. Often such applications come along with the operating system software and some of these could be easily downloaded for free through internet. 

<b>2. </b> CD player with in built mp3 functionality
There are many home, portable and car CD players with this in built function whereby you can play the mp3 CD’s you created yourself. 

<b>3. </b> Portable mp3 player
You can use portable mp3 players that are highly compact and light weight and many of them offer complete skip free playback and usually support number of audio file formats. 

<b> Sound quality of an Mp3 </b>
The sound quality of an mp3 file depends upon factors such as quality of original source of audio and the encoding software used to create the file that could provide different results upon different programs. Many of the Mp3 encoders allow you to select the bit rate i.e. the average amount of data required per second of music. Those Mp3 files that are encoded at higher bit rates provide better quality of sound but use more memory.
