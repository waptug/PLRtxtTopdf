Importance of Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format. The Adobe Acrobat PDF provides the reader fine details of images which are easy to read and a small file size which enables quicker downloading. Installing a PDF has benefits such as it facilitates quick zoom in/out and copy/paste of images or text. It helps you produce forms which look exactly like the original when you print them. The only requirement is to get a free Adobe Reader program before getting to read the PDF which can be done quite easily and is a one time effort.

Tips for setting up a PDF. Once you click on the Abode icon to download the Adobe Reader you can save the file on your hard drive. A problem faced by most people is that they forget where they have saved their Adobe file on the hard drive thus it is recommended that you store it in a temporary file as well from where it can be easily accessed. When you are given an option of where to save the file do not click on the “return” key before checking where the file is being saved. Write down the name of the file and the folder or the area where you are saving the file to enable you to find the file later and not waste much time searching. 20

Finding the downloaded file. To find the downloaded file first of all shut down all programs running on the net and open the file where you downloaded Adobe Reader and double click on the program icon. If you are finding a file using Windows start by clicking on the 'Start' button and then on 'find' followed by clicking on 'files' or 'folders'. Then type in the name of the file which you noted down previously as a temporary file. Double click on the name which will display the program selected. Once the set up process is complete you can click on the PDF which you want to read. For getting details of certain areas you can use their zoom in facility to get a bigger picture and detailed information. If you do not have a printer, get a free reader installed in order to view your PDF document.
