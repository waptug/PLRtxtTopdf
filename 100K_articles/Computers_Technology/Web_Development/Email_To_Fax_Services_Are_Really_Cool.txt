Few people would think that any form of faxing could be considered as cool. Then again, many people from the last generation lost the wonder that copy machines used to instill. The technology has unfortunately been stereotyped as old, inconvenient, and ultimately more of a hassle than a good technology in today's digital world. Yet, we cannot forget that new technology is now being built that connects old fax machines with new email technology.

In general, an email to fax service can be seen as just being really cool. Normally you would have to go through a lot of trouble to get a fax message sent out. Few people have actual fax machines inside their house and many would not want to run to the local library or copy center to try and send out their private message in a very public setting.

Add in the pain and suffering felt as you have to constantly fiddle with the toner levels and paper levels, while also trying to use the buttons properly, so that your private resume does not get sent to random people halfway across the country. Sending out a fax in the traditional way is quite a hassle.

Email to fax services remove this trouble. They effectively just improve upon current attachment technology to give all of your little documents a professional feel without the hassle of actually sending a fax. All you have to do is rig up a special email using software provided by an internet fax service. This is usually obtained for a relatively low monthly cost. This software then composes your email message into a professional level PDF file that can be sent out as a normal fax.

You just have to punch in the number properly as the receiver of the email and your provider will take care of the rest. The receiver will not know that you used an online service. It will seem like just any other fax message that comes in. They don't realize how much time and effort you managed to save by taking advantage of new technology.

This can also work in the reverse if you choose to use an established online fax service. Such a service will give you a real fax number that people can even send hard copy faxes to. The information is intercepted and sent to you as a PDF file that can be read easily through your email account like any other message.

That is much easier than constantly checking your fax machine for new messages. You won't have to keep taking the long walk to the machine, and best of all, your messages will be kept to the privacy of your own inbox and away from the prying eyes of nosy employees or competing salesmen.

Email to fax services are just one of the many new technological advances to communications. These services are really cool for anyone from the common office worker to the hardcore businessman or woman. They are a huge improvement over the old ways. At the same time, they still give all of the professional quality that a hard line fax provides.
