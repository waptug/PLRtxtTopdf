Making a paper toy is just like solving a maths problem. Not a difficult problem, not an easy problem, but mathematics does not condone a mistake. To arrive at the correct final answer, your steps need to be correct. Each and every step! Let's have a quick look at how to solve this question paper and learn to make paper toys articulately.

First things first, a paper toy is a toy that is made after folding the paper. It is all about folding the paper in style indeed! This art is known as Origami. You need to know the basic folds, the folds that give strength to the ultimate toy that you are going to form out of it.

Just study all the details of the toy that you are going to form, if you are making this new design for the first time. Your requirements of raw material is simple: Paper, foil backing, cutting material such as knife, scissors or blades, glues, paints and other craft goods.

Your end product needs to be good, appealing and also the product should last. By using a low quality paper, you might end up in fiasco. You would tear the paper at the most unsuspected moment, when you are about to give finishing touch to the toy. If you use the heavy paper, the folds will be tough, you will not be happy to work with this paper and the toy might end up with the appearance of a heavy-weight boxer.

The papers suggested are colored bond paper or the commercial origami paper. Once given proper shape and color, these nature-friendly toys are easy to carry-- they are lightweight and as for appeal and appearance, they score over with toys of any other genre.
