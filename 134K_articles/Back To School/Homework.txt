Homework

	School is out for the day.  The kids are home.  They have had their after school snack.  Now they want to play.  When should they get their homework done?  This answer depends on your kids and your schedule at home.  Find the time that works best for your family. 
	Sometimes it works best to get the homework done and out of the way.  Right after school, you can sit down with your kids and talk about their day.  It’s a great time to pull out the homework and get to it. 	
	After dinner you can clean up the kitchen table and plop down the textbooks.  The kids have had time to play and relax after school.  This might be the perfect time to engage their minds.  
	If your kids are early risers, getting homework done in the morning before school might work well for your family.  They can eat breakfast and get ready for school.  Instead of morning cartoons, this might be a great alternative.  If you have extra time, sit down with your kids and help them finish up their homework.  This will be a great prep to get them ready for a day of learning at school.  
	You don’t want to do the last minute homework dash.  This can happen when your children don’t have a regular homework time.  It can be easy to forget about homework after school.  Next morning, as your children gather their things for school, they suddenly remember.  This adds stress to your morning and gives unnecessary stress to your kids.  Make sure that you find a time to do homework that works for your family.  Consistently doing homework or after school reading helps develop successful study habits that will carry with them.
