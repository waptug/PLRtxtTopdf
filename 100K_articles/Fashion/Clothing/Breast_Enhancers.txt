So many different products have been advertised to make the breast bigger and fuller, that an entire industry was created fore the sole purpose of breast enhancement.

After researching all the crazy attempts to market products that boast of being able to actually make breasts larger, it is easy to come to the conclusion that there is really only a couple of ways to actually increase bust size.

The most efficient breast enhancer available to women today is a good push-up bra. Even though there are an abundance of products on the market claiming that they have the latest pill, cream, gel or gadget that will enhance the size of a breast, the reality is, with the exception of surgery, the only thing that truly does enhance a womens breast is a breast enhancing bra. 

The purchasing power of women in search of larger breast is so undeniably enormous that it has led to the continuing quest to find the perfect breast enhancing bra.

A good breast enhancing bra will give a woman enough added inches to her breast to make her feel sexier and more attractive. This being the manufacturers intention, there is a wide variety of bras out there designed specifically for this purpose. 

Bras have come a long way since the corsets of Victorian times. The first bras to have actual cup sizing, a, b, c or d, were not patented until 1935. Since then there have been quite a few attempts to sell women that perfect bra that is sure to enhance the size of her breasts. 

From foam padding, to water or gel filled breast cups, many bra makers have tried to come up with the ultimate breast enhancing solution. Of course, most of the major designers lay claim to that their bra is the best available on the market today.

A push-up bra basically takes what a woman already has to offer and lifts and molds these assets to their most flattering potential. The task of any breast enhancer is to optimize the breast and make it look as full as possible.
