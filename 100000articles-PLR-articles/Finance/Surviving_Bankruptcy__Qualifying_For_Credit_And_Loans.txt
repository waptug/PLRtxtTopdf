When many people think about surviving bankruptcy, they are usually worried about whether or not they will be able to qualify for credit and loans in the future.

So how does one go about surviving bankruptcy? First, you need to put together a game plan - then focus on working that plan.

For example, let's say that qualifying for credit and loans is one of your concerns when it comes to surviving bankruptcy - and by the way, it's a valid concern.

So what would your "surviving bankruptcy" game plan look like when it comes to qualifying for credit and loans? Here are three steps you could follow:

Surviving Bankruptcy Step #1: Rebuild your credit

Rebuilding your credit as soon as possible is critical when it comes to surviving bankruptcy. Why? Because rebuilding your credit history can increase your credit score. This in turn can mean the difference between qualifying or being declined for a loan. Second, if you increase your credit score enough it could help you get a lower interest rate - as a result, you could end up saving $100s or even $1,000s in extra interest.

Surviving Bankruptcy Step #2: Know how the credit approval process works

This is another key part of your surviving bankruptcy game plan. You need to know what lenders look for when evaluating a credit application, and how to use that information to your advantage. I cover this in detail in After Bankruptcy Credit Solutions. Timing is also critical - a lot of people who have had a bankruptcy get this wrong when applying for a loan.

Surviving Bankruptcy Step #3: Know how to apply for credit

If you've followed steps 1 and 2, then you're ready for step three. One key part in step 3 is knowing which lenders to apply with. If you don't, you could end up being in for disappointing results - which can make surviving bankruptcy unnecessarily difficult. Also, once you do find the right lender you want to reduce your interest expenses - there are specific steps you can take that can save you up to $100s or even $1,000s of dollars. There is not enough room to cover them here, but I do go through them in After Bankruptcy Credit Solutions.

So now you know some steps you can take when it comes to surviving bankruptcy as far as credit and loans are concerned. Of course, much will depend on your personal financial situation, age of your bankruptcy, credit score, etc. But hopefully, you can use them as a starting point when it comes to credit and loans after bankruptcy.
