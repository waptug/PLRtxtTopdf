Driving around in a vehicle that feels too cold or too warm for comfort is something that would make most people cringe and rather stay home or even try to rather walk or take public transportation. That is why it was a good thing that vehicle manufacturers and experts have come up with the climate control system so as to assist passengers and drivers as well during their journey. 

The Land Rover brand has certainly been up to date with the changes and innovations in the automobile market. That is why this brand has made it possible for all the models in their vehicle line up are given Land Rover climate control systems. How does the Rover climate control system works? The Land Rover climate control system actually has been divided into two sides which are comprised of the high side and the low side. The compressor which actually begins at the high side functions and serves like a pump that moves the refrigerant through the system. As per the lower side, the expansion valve which actually begins on this side, restricts the refrigerant flow, and in the process, it lowers the pressure and the temperature of the refrigerant. By doing such functions, the Land Rover climate control system is able to keep the vehicle’s temperature just right on stormy and cold evenings or on hot and humid summer days. 

It is important to note also that one should be able to understand how the controls of the Land Rover climate control system works. Basically, you could find three dials. Each of these dials stand for a specific purpose. There is one dial for temperature control. Another dial is for the fan speed. And the last one is there for ventilation controls, and ventilation controls includes the dash vents, the floor vents, the defrost vents or even a combination of any of those. These dials twist around so that you can actually set the right temperature and climate for your Land Rover vehicle. If you look closer, you could also find at the center of each of these dials are buttons that function for the air conditioning compressor, the cabin air recirculation, as well as the rear defrost. All these are part of the Land Rover climate control system.
