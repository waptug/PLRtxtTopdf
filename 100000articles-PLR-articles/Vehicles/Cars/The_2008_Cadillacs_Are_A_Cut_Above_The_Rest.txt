STS. This is Cadillac's six-pack as there are six separate 2008 STS packages. There are three V8 and three V6 variants. Five of the six include the word "luxury" in its name.

The V6 Luxury Performance and the V8 Premium Luxury Performance packages begin at $48,890 and $60,745, respectively.

CTS. The 2008 CTS offers a direct injection 3.6-liter V6 and all-wheel drive steering to enhance maneuverability and stability. A Bose 5.1 Cabin Surround sound system keeps the music in tune, while a double sunroof, while a double sunroof expands horizons. The CTS' base price is $32,990. 

SRX. Crossovers are either super-size station wagons or undersize SUVs. Take your pick. While crossovers are commonplace sights on America's roads, it was a bold step for the pedigreed manufacturer to enter the fold with its compelling line. The SRX models come with V6 or V8 engines. The V6 is a five-speed Hydra-matic automatic transmission, while the V8 is a six-speed. Both are available with all-wheel drive. Bases prices are $37,695 and $44,690.

The spacious SUVs are presented in three ways, the Escalade, the Escalade ESV, and the Escalade EXT. All models are offered in AWD and offer a dizzying array of standard features and optional packages. The Escalade's base price is $55,640; the ESV's is $60,160; and the EXT starts at $55,155.
