Before purchasing a new computer, research the many laptop deals that can be found in electronic stores. Look in the weekly sales ads and compare the sales from week to week.

Follow all of the instructions on the laptop rebate and be sure to make copies for reference. Also, remember that laptop rebates often takes several weeks.

Another way to get a great laptop deal is to shop around. Do not settle for the first sale you see. Look at all ad circulars for you local electronic stores and compare the prices. Be certain that the laptop you are looking for is the exact same as in the ad. Laptops can be very similar, even with the same brands. There are usually small things, such as different software that makes the price on laptop deals different.

Some often have sales that are only available through their website. If you do choose to purchase a laptop from the Internet, make sure you are making the purchase through a reputable dealer. Be wary of any website where you do not know for certain that the laptop is a brand name or if the laptop deal seems too good to be true. If you are uncertain about the reputation of an online dealer, it is usually better to research the company or go with another store.
