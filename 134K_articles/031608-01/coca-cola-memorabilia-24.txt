Coca Cola Memorabilia

I remember when I was in my friend’s wedding, and we traveled to her mother’s home to stay for a few days before and during her wedding. Her parents had the most amazing home I had seen in a long time, but the coolest part of the house was not seen until we went into their finished basement. There we found a room full of Coca Cola memorabilia that would have blown just about anyone away. The room was done like a diner from the fifties, but the main theme of the room was the old pieces advertising Coca Cola. It was truly a sight to see.

Coca Cola memorabilia is popular with those that lived back when soda shops were the common places for teenagers to hang out. They have a lot of memories in those places, and it is very understandable that they would want to have things in their home that remind them of those times. Though going through the teen years is always hard, things tended to be a bit simpler then. With the fast paced problematic world we live in now, it is quite understandable that something like Coca Cola memorabilia would be a welcome reminder of when times were much more relaxing.

When searching for Coca Cola memorabilia, you do have to think about the time frame in which you are interested. There are many different decades, and many different advertising campaigns from which to choose. That means that you can mix and match, or you can get memorabilia from Coca Cola from a time that means the most to you. You can also build a collection that tracks the different looks of Coke design through the decades for a more comprehensive type of collection. 

If you are not into Coca Cola memorabilia, but you know someone who is, finding a piece they don’t have is going to make a great gift. What you should do before you buy, however, is find out if there are only certain time periods they are interested in, or if anything would be welcome. You may even want to view their collection with them and then ask them questions about it so you know what they want. You can find pieces of Coca Cola memorabilia online, and you can also bid on it in person and on sites like eBay. Remember to keep space in mind. Some pieces are rather large, and that might mean they don’t have room for the one you have your eye on as a gift.
