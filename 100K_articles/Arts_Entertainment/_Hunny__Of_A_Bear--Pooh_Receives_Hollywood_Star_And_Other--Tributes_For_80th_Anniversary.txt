&#8226; The first Winnie the Pooh story appeared on Christmas Eve 1925 in a story called "The Wrong Sort of Bees."

&#8226; Christopher Robin's favorite food is birthday cake.

&#8226; Winnie the Pooh made his theatrical debut in Disney's featurette "Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree" in 1966. 

&#8226; There have been at least three actors to voice Winnie the Pooh: Sterling Holloway, Hal Smith and Jim Cummings.

&#8226; Next to Winnie the Pooh, Tigger is kids' next favorite character of the Hundred Acre Wood.
