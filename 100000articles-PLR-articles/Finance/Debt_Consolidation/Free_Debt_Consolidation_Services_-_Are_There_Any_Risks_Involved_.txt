Considering soliciting the services of a debt consolidator is a good idea if you have massive debts, and are struggling to stay afloat.  The economy is such at this present time that even many middle class families are having a difficult time.  Housing is a big issue - homes are not selling, big reductions in the price of a home is seen, and new building construction is down. The evening news has many stories about people unable to pay rent, pay an ever-increasing heating bill, and unable to pay the high price of gasoline to even go out and look for work.  We are a nation in deep economic trouble.

People today are more and more turning to debt consolidation services to help bail them out of an unstable financial position. Services provided can help you to bring down your rate of interest and your amount of repayment on a scheduled basis. It will also help to decrease the stress your heavy debt load has caused you.

Soliciting the help of a "free" debt consolidation service could be an even greater benefit to you.  Even though it is not actually "free" to solicit these services, it is almost always far cheaper than it would to get the same service from a company that proivides this service to make a profit. The or-profit debt consolidators generally charge a flat every month for services provided, whereas free debt consolidators are subsidized in part by the actual creditors themselves.  Consequently the no-profit debt consolidation servicest only need to charge the flat monthly fee, which means that in the long run,  debtors will end up with lower rates.

Not only do free debt consolidation services provide free debt consolidation, they also are not restricted to mere debt consolidation loans. In this country, are also a large number of credit counseling agencies that are non-profit. These agencies help individuals get their credit under control through education and credit counseling.

It is the general opinion that people with poor credit prefer free debt consolidation service. On the other hand, for-profit services prefer clients who have relatively good credit, as they are more likely to be able to gain the full repayment. Because free debt consolidation services enjoy healthy subsidies from the creditors, they can afford to take the risk of helping people with poor credit who want to set their finances right.

Since free debt consolidation services are more attractive, people will generally prefer it to for-profit services. However, the consumer needs to beware of scam companies that have been quick to exploit this preference and proclaim themselves as free services. It is always important to confirm the credibility of any organization you deal with, especially if they claim to be a free debt consolidation. If not, you could end up with even more massive debts.
