For new, small and growing companies, online classified advertising can be a very useful way to recruit new employees.

Classified ads are also a great way to advertise internship opportunities for extra summer help or for recruiting new graduates. Job descriptions are often posted by category so your ad will be exposed to people that are looking for a position within a company like yours. The ads are usually posted much longer than a traditional classified ad, and best of all it’s a completely free service for your company.

No matter what your company offers, you can advertise on free classified ads. Whether you provide services or sell a product you can advertise it for free. For small businesses that are trying to make a presence in a community this is a great way to get started.

Another great benefit with online classified ads is promotion of events. If your company gets involved with an event, promotes a workshop or class, or anything that you want the public to get involved in, you can advertise it completely free online.

Most individuals and companies have to pay annual membership fees or pay for these kinds of advertising benefits. But free online classified ads are just that – completely free.
