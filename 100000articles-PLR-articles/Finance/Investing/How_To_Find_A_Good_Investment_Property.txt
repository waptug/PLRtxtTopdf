Rental real estate is slowly becoming a good investment endeavor although there are some skeptical few who still thinks that it’s a daunting undertaking. Well we just can’t blame them since searching for a good investment property is really hard. However, for those few optimists rental property is great way to accumulate wealth.

Just like any type of business undertaking it is important that you have a concrete plan or strategy on how you are going to develop your rental real estate into a money-making endeavor. Otherwise, you will end up losing all of your investment.

You need to do some painstaking research and probably have some connections to find a profitable rental property. This is because your objective is to make profit within the shortest time possible. This is also the same reason why you should find a seller that is willing to give you free equity.

Here are some tips to help you get started with your rental real estate business:

•You need to have an investment plan since this will help you determine the duration of your ownership of particular rental property. Remember that the longer you own the property, the more you’ll spend on maintenance, repairs and improvements. If you want to make any major improvements on the property, be sure the sale price will be enough to cover the cost. If you are not sure then better not spend too much. Nevertheless, owning the rental estate property for less time would also create more investment risk especially when buying in an overheated market. To compensate for that risk, you need a bigger potential annual return.For many small investors, however, long-term ownership is smart because it allows them plenty of time to outlast any fluctuations in the market -- and also since the rental income can be a nice supplementary income in the meantime. Being a landlord is even a rewarding day job for some.

• There are various ways of finding properties and these are as follows: hunt properties that are already for foreclosure, you will be able to get some information by means of befriending city hall clerks or bank employees who know of properties that are about to be foreclosed or are already foreclosed; you may also try to contact a real estate agent who’s on the lookout for possible buys; or you may join a local landlord or property owner’s association in order for you to make contacts. And while you’re at it why not ask landlords directly to see if they are willing to selling; you may try looking in newspapers for rental ads or you may drive around neighborhoods in order to search “ for rent” signs.

Get your finances in shape

If you really want to engage in a rental estate property business you need to have a good credit standing -- meaning less credit card debt and other consumer debt. You see, lenders usually require bigger down payments, charge higher interest rates and want your finances to be in better shape when you are buying rental properties.

It really pays to have a large cash reserve after buying any property since there might be some needed repairs that rental property may require. If you can afford to set aside at least one month rent for each unit, that’s a good start. You may also try to apply for a line of credit secured either by the property or your own home in order to cover larger costs.

Avoid overspending
The reason why you invest on a rental estate property is for you to gain profits and not to lose every savings you’ve got. Make sure that you still have save enough for your retirement before investing in rental real estate since just like any business wherein you tend to lose some and then win some but just to be on the safe side try to save as much as you could. Better be prepared than be sorry later on.
