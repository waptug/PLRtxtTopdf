I mean, we all want a career that allows us to kick back with our 1000 dollar shoes up on the desk and gaze happily out at a million dollar view each day. Oh, and from the hundredth floor of some billion dollar business. Did I leave anything out? Okay, well unfortunately most of us don't find that exact job, but we do have the ability to find a career that makes us happy. Have you researched any jobs online lately? You can definitely stumble across a job opportunity if you do some browsing. Cyberspace is practically overflowing with them.

What kind of job opportunity are you looking for? I asked my 17 year old daughter this the other days since she's about to graduate. She gave me a serious look and informed me that she would like to be the head of some large, billion dollar corporation. I was speechless. Then she said, "How can I do that right now?" I couldn't help but laugh. I honestly don't know what kids are thinking these days. I looked her square in the eye and said, you can't. First you have to go to college, get a bachelor's degree, then hopefully a master's. Following your diploma will come an entry position at some company, and you will continue to work your way up. She frowned and thought I was nuts. Well, in the real world no one enters a company after high school and becomes a CEO or president. As much as that would be ideal, it just doesn't work that way.

If a job opportunity is what you're searching for, then the perfect place to start is online. So you've got your bachelor's degree and you're seriously looking for that perfect job opportunity that suits your skills. It's time to pop open Monster.com or Careerbuilder.com. These are easy to navigate websites that will help you discover that perfect job opportunity. You can browse positions in your immediate area or nationwide. Punch in the field you prefer and do a quick search. If this doesn't give you the desired results, you can also punch in your degree for more feedback. That job opportunity you're looking for is out there if you browse in the right place. You can even send your resume to a potential employer via the World-Wide-Web.
