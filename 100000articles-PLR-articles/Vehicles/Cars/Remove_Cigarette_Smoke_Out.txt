Cigarette smoke is one of those odors that are very hard to remove from your car. This smell is very much likely to stick to your car’s interior and stay there for a long period of time. You might not be a smoker yourself, however, if you do drive with a smoker or if you share your car with a smoker, the odor might be irritating for you. You may have tried air fresheners and airing your car out. However, these do not work effectively. 

The very best thing to do is clean out your car. The odor is easily overpowered to take flight once you get to clean your car. The fact is that cigarette smoke is much more likely to stick and live in your car’s interior. So cleaning then out would also drive away the odor. 

First off, try shampooing your car’s interior. Do not forget to do the same to your carpets, upholstery, seats, and floor mats. You can use an odor eliminating shampoo to take off the smell of cigarette smoke. If you do not know where to purchase such a product, you can try locating one through the Internet. Or you can visit your local hardware or home improvement store. You can find one of these from these sources. 

Do not leave out all the surfaces of your car’s cabin. Use the same shampoo to clean these parts. To do so, you would need a damp sponge. Just place a small amount of the shampoo on the sponge then work it on the surface and then wipe down. Also clean your windows. This time, you can use a glass cleaner. 

By doing such, in no time at all, you would be saying goodbye to that cigarette smoke odor that has been bothering you for a long time. Just make sure that you do not allow anybody else to smoke while inside your vehicle.
