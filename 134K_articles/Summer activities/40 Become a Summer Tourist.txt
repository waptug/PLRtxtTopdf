Become a Summer Tourist

There are many activities in or around your city that you probably know all the tourists 
go to, but when was the last time you went?  Just because you have been there many 
times before along with your children doesn’t mean they wouldn’t love to go again (and 
again and again).

Take a few days during the summer break to visit attractions and destinations that you 
haven’t been to in awhile.  If you know that the place is going to be crowded on the 
weekend or in the afternoons go on a weekday morning.  The added benefit of being a 
local and going to a tourist destination is that you know the ins and outs and the tricks to 
get the most out of your day.

Water parks are always popular and tend to fill up around and after lunch time.  Try and 
go when the park first opens to beat the crowds.  If you leave before lunch time, you can 
save money by eating at home and get out of the hot midday sun.

Going to your local zoo is an all day event.  Pack a picnic lunch and if you aren’t able to 
bring it into the park get a hand stamp and leave for awhile to eat.  Consider buying a 
season’s pass too.  Most times a pass will pay for itself in less than three visits.  If you 
don’t want to spend all day at the zoo, break it up into 2-3 hour chunks and keep coming 
back.

Go to your local visitor’s center and pick up the free brochures that are available there.  
You might find some excursions you didn’t know about or had forgotten existed.  The 
staff at the visitor’s center usually have coupons for free or discounted admission too.  
Take advantage of your local resources.
