IRA123.com is happy to announce that BusinessFinance.com has recognized that trend and they have listed them in their Business Funding Directory which provides resources for entrepreneurs seeking financing. 

“Both IRA123.com and BusinessFinance.com complement each other very well,” says Robert Hubbard, Founder and CEO of IRA123.com. “We provide a simplified approach to setting up an IRA so you can invest it into your business, and BusinessFinance.com can now provide alternative funding options to entrepreneurs in need of capital.” 

IRA123.com turns what is typically a complex process into a simple three step process. They provide the resources and the knowledge necessary to allow anyone to setup a self directed IRA.
