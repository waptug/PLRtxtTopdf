If you use article submission in this manner, you are sure to create for yourself quite a good amount of free traffic. Unless you pay someone to write for you, you have very little to no cost at all on this traffic generator.
 <li>If you really don't want to do the writing for yourself, you can easily find writers that can write for you. While you will have to pay them, you will still be able to get excellent results.  It  as simple as finding the writer, conveying your need and then submitting the articles to article directories.  Then, you will have even less to do yourself. That makes your job easier while still giving the same results.
 <li>Believe it or not, the value of using article submission may be more so than just getting the back links to your websites. In fact, you will be able to establish yourself as somewhat of an expert on the subject. This helps you to gain recognition as being a good source of information on the subject of your website.

All of these benefits are really only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the benefits of using article submission.  The bottom line is that your website, no matter how large or small, no matter what type of budget you actually have can have a good amount of traffic on it.  When webmasters take your article, with your link attached to it, and place it on their website for content use, you are the one who is going to get traffic.  Consider your own process.  If you went to a website, read an article and learned about something would you click the link at the bottom to find out more about who wrote it or where to get the items?  It is very much possible to generate quite a bit of traffic from this virtually free type of advertising.
