You may have heard of a new craze that is sweeping the world of online finance – cash advance payments.  What you may not know is what they are and how you can apply for one.

Simply put, cash advance payments are small sums of money advanced to borrowers for a short-term period.  The amount you can borrow is dependent on how much your salary is, but normally ranges from $250 to $1,000.  The period you can borrow the money for is until your next paycheck, unless you and the lender agree to a longer period.  In any event, it is highly unlikely the amount can be borrowed for longer than two paychecks.

All you need in order to apply for cash advance payments is to have a current job and a valid bank account.  That’s it!  Your credit rating is not important, as this will not be checked.  You won’t even need to provide any security!  You will, however, need to apply for the cash advance payment online via an online application, with a copy of your latest pay-slip and bank account details.  Once your application has been approved, the advanced cash will be sent to your nominated bank account.  Then, on your next payday the lender will use the same bank account details for you to make repayment of the advanced cash.

So, if you have any unexpected bills to pay or simply want to borrow some money very quickly, cash advance payments could provide you with the perfect answer to your needs.
