Restructuring your debt will help you gain control of your finances once again. You can consolidate payments into more manageable amounts at a lower rate. Or you can also turn to third parties to help you deal with your creditors.

Taking Advantage Of Debt Consolidation

Using a debt consolidation loan will help you take charge of your monthly payments once more. Disposing of your high interest credit cards for a low interest home equity or personal loan can easily cut your rates in half.

By restructuring your debt with a new loan, you can also rearrange the payment structure. So you might decide to retire your debt with a small, easy to manage monthly payment over several years. Or you can opt for a short loan period with larger payments to quickly improve your debt ratio.

Once you have consolidated your bills with a new loan and retired old accounts, your credit score will have a minimal impact. And with regular payments, it will quickly improve.

When Others Can Help Your Finances

In some cases, you might want to turn to a company to help you regain control of your debt. A debt consolidation company can manage your short term accounts and lower your rates on credit card accounts, helping you to stay out of bankruptcy.

By turning over control to a third party, you save peace of mind and money. But your credit score will have a temporary decline as creditors place holds on new credit applications. For at least a year, they want to see that you will indeed be making regular payments.

If you just need some advice, a credit counselor can help you develop a budget with short and long term goals. They may also refer you to a debt consolidation company or other financial services. With their training, they can help you see your finances more clearly.
