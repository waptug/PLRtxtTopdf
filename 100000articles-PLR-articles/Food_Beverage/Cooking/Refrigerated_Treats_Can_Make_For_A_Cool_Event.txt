It's always a great time to get "Back to Cool" and enjoy a picnic with family and friends.

The refrigerated dairy aisle of your local grocery store can be a great source for tasty, convenient selections for your outdoor gatherings, such as cheeses, breads, jello, dips, puddings, yogurts, juices and much more. 

Try ideas like these for a very tasty picnic:

&#8226; Make an easy, scrumptious potato salad with convenient refrigerated potato selections. 

&#8226; Create and bake delicious snacks with refrigerated bread dough and shredded cheese.

&#8226; Stock up on a variety of yogurt flavors and pack fresh fruit for dipping. 

&#8226; Try the many dips and sour cream selections and bring plenty of fresh vegetables to the picnic. 

&#8226; Remember the individually packed cheese slices to top grilled hamburgers or to enjoy as simple snacks.

&#8226; Don't forget the whipped toppings to make any dessert special.

While you are planning your menu, also plan for a safe picnic. Food spoilage and cross-contamination are real concerns when eating food outdoors in warm weather. Be sure to follow these tips from the National Frozen & Refrigerated Foods Association (NFRA) to ensure your picnic is a healthy one:

&#8226; Bring water for preparation and cleaning, or pack clean, wet, disposable cloths or moist towelettes and paper towels for cleaning hands, surfaces and utensils.

&#8226; It's important to keep hot food hot and cold food cold during the picnic. 

&#8226; Carry cold perishable foods in an insulated cooler packed with ice or frozen gel packs. Make sure raw meat and poultry are wrapped securely to prevent juices from cross-contaminating.

&#8226; If bringing hot take-out food such as fried chicken, eat it within two hours of purchase or plan ahead and chill the food in the fridge before packing in an insulated cooler.

&#8226; Don't stock the cooler until immediately before leaving from home. Keep the cooler in the coolest part of the car when traveling.
