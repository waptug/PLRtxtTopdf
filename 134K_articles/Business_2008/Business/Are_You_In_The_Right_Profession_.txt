Article Body:
All of us are busy working in a particular area to earn our living. Some of us are business persons and some are employed. Some are engineers, others doctors, carpenters and so on. We have painters, architects, firemen and all types of professionals.

The question is - Why did you choose a particular profession? Were you tested scientifically in our childhood about your aptitude, or whether it was your family profession, or you wanted to become one because you had fancy for that, or you had nothing else to chose so you chose your current profession?

Along the way in life, we stop asking these questions and continue doing what we are doing. We never think about why we are doing a particular kind of job. We never look around for total change in the job. For example - an engineer would very rarely think about dropping out of his/her profession and becoming a full time musician. Why?

why most of us don't think about changing our profession altogether? Why don't we think in that direction at all? One reason is to maintain status quo, which gives us comfort. We want to live in our comfort zone. The second reason is that we never question ourselves- Am I in a profession that I like fully? Can I choose another profession that will give me more success and joy?

Please think about what I have said and rethink about your profession. You may find something else that may give you not only satisfaction but great success.
