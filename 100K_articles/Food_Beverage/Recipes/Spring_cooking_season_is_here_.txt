Barbecued Pot Roast

INGREDIENTS:
•	1 beef pot roast, 4 to 5 pounds 
•	2 tablespoons vegetable oil 
•	cayenne and cumin
•	1 cup water 
•	1 can (8 ounces) tomato sauce 
•	2 cups sliced onions 
•	2 cloves garlic, minced 
•	2 tablespoons brown sugar 
•	1/2 teaspoon dry mustard 
•	1/4 cup lemon juice 
•	1/4 cup vinegar 
•	1/4 cup ketchup 
•	1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 
Go ahead and brown the meat either on a grill or in an oven. Add some cayenne and cumin for that added dash of “what the hell is that?”. Now add the tomato sauce, water. onion, and minced garlic. Cover and simmer for roughly 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Add the remaining ingredients, cover, and continue cooking for 1 1/2 hours longer, or until roast is tender. 
Check the recipe every now and then, and add additional water if necessary. Take out the meat and remove excess fat. The recipe serves 5-7.

Beef and Pineapple Shish Ka Bobs

Otherwise known as sirloin beef kabobs with pineapple
INGREDIENTS:
•	1/2 cup soy sauce 
•	3 tablespoons honey 
•	2 tablespoons vinegar 
•	1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder 
•	1 1/2 teaspoons ginger 
•	3/4 cup oil 
•	1 green onion, chopped 
•	2 1/2 pounds boneless beef top sirloin, cubed 1-inch 
•	1 (8oz) can pineapple tidbits, drained 
•	3 red bell pepper, cut in 1-inch chunks 
•	2 jalapenos
•	2 red onions, cut in 1-inch wedges 
•	8 long metal skewers
PREPARATION:
In a large plastic food bag, combine the soy sauce, honey, vinegar, ginger, garlic powder, oil, and green onion. Add sirloin cubes and marinate several hours or overnight. 
This is the most important step. Whenever you marinate over night, make sure you do NOT leave the marinate uncovered. Sometimes marinades will pick up other smells from food around the bowl, so be aware of that.
Drain the meat when ready and skewer the beef, pineapple and vegetables. Grill over a fire or a barbeque for 16 to 18 minutes. 
Serves 8.
