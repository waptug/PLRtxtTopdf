Who does not know the slinky? It flips and flops over stairs and even on flat surfaces. As it moves, its different colors flash, creating breathtaking spectrums and moving works of art. If you are like most children, the Slinky(r) is probably your first hands-on experience with a spring. It won't be your last, however. The gas lift bar stool will reintroduce you to this simple yet invaluable tool.  

 When Gas Is Not Gasoline 
The "gas" in gas lift bar stool is not gasoline. The technology is based on the patent for a gas lift chair, which a man from Midwestern Germany received. The patent mentions the unique idea of using a gas spring, in order to adjust a chair. A gas spring creates a force by using a compressed gas in a tube. The gas lift bar stool uses the same technology as a gas lift chair, to make the user more comfortable and able to adjust to his environment better. He does this by adjusting his height, so he could sit at a comfortable level in relation to the table, desk, counter, or island - a kitchen island, that is. 

 Spring Time 
If the "gas" in gas lift bar stool refers to a lifting mechanism, what of "spring"? What is the spring in gas lift bar stools? The expressions "Spring into life," "spring forward," and "spring in his step" show that the concept of springs has made it into our everyday speech. But how often do we stop to think about how a spring works? 

A spring is a stretchable part in a machine. It is able to push back in a certain way when a load is placed on it. Then, it gets its original shape back when the load is removed. Energy is created when the spring works, and can be stored when the spring becomes a source of power. While a gas lift bar stool uses an air spring, liquid springs also exist. Nevertheless, the majority of springs are mechanical.   

 A Spring in the Lying 
The gas spring is the movie director of machines. Though we rarely see them,  contraptions could not function without them. In fact, besides being included in gas lift bar stools, gas springs are used in the following everyday applications:   
 
* Deli cases and displays
* Desk lids for students
* Fitness equipment adjustments
* Food processing equipment
* Hospital bed positioning
* Keyboard positioning
* Medical and diagnostic equipment
* Printers' sound enclosures
* Stretchers
* Vehicle and aircraft doors 
* Wheelchairs

So what makes gas springs special? On gas lift bar stools, they make the lifting and lowering of the gas lift bar stool a piece of cake. Moreover, they improve the sitting experience of the sitter.  They also allow for unlimited adjustment positions, at the same time compensating for the weight of the gas lift bar stool's sitter. Lastly, gas springs are self-contained, require no maintenance, could last as long as the stool does, and are cost-effective.  

We are often introduced to springs at a young age in the form of a spring toy. As adults, springs, including gas springs, assume more complex and at the same time, more practical roles in our lives. This is amply demonstrated by the gas lift bar stool.
Unlike other furniture, a gas lift bar stool gives you a lift when you need it.
