We’ve all heard the horror stories of employers viewing the web pages their employees frequent on slow days. I was surprised to find out how easy it is for “big brother” to see the movies, pictures, websites and other computer associated things people download. In today’s working environment, surfing the internet is downright risky! Evidence Neutralizer understands this, and seeks to protect you in every way imaginable.

With Evidence Neutralizer, sites are prevented from improperly changing your home page and everything from your recent files to your browser cache and cookies are neutralized from doing you harm. Snooping spouses and bosses will be left with nothing to find! 

Evidence Neutralizer is also easy to run. You can set it to automatically do a clean sweep of your computer on a daily, weekly or hourly basis. If that’s not your speed, you can also run it manually. Now, the software even has a pop up killer! Surfing the internet is now safer and easier than ever, thanks to Evidence Neutralizer.

Your privacy is something too precious to leave unprotected. You can trust Evidence Neutralizer to keep your personal files and internet usage between you and your computer. I enthusiastically and emphatically recommend Evidence Neutralizer to anyone who has a computer. In these days, when it seems like everyone is spying on you, Evidence Neutralizer is a must have.
