Article Body:
GoYin is based on 5,000-year-old Traditional Asian Medicine, or TAM. Its formula combines 20 superfruits, fruits and herbs blended in a way that maximizes nutritional benefits. GoYin promotes healthy energy, mood enhancement and antioxidant power.
Healthy energy*, an enhanced mood*, and antioxidant power* are three very powerful reasons why people love GoYin.

GoYin follows the strict precepts of TAM in its blending of superfruits, fruits, and herbs in just the right proportions to bring out the true power of each. More than just an array of nutrient-rich ingredients, the GoYin formula achieves “Pei Fang,” an exacting combination that demands the right ingredients be combined in the right amounts and in the right order.
