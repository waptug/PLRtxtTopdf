All right now, no laughing. Probably the easiest part to swap out in a car is the air filter. A quick pop of the hood and the loosening of a couple of clamps or a wing nut and you simply reach in and pull out the old air filter. Next, open the box up containing your new air filter, pop it into place, secure everything and you are done. Five, maybe ten minutes to accomplish the easiest job going. So, why doesn't everyone change their own air filter? More importantly, why don't more people opt for environmentally friendly air filters, commonly known as "green" air filters? You can install a green air filter yourself and do much more than keep the air clean in the process.

So, what is a "green" air filter? A green air filter is an environmentally friendly air filter. No, they aren't usually green as the color green is what signifies that the product works in harmony with nature. Now go hug a tree.

<b>Seriously, there are several advantages to owning a green or reusable air filter:</b>

<b>Once is Enough. </b> With a reusable air filter, you never have to buy another air filter again for your car. Periodically, all you would have to do is take the air filter out, clean it, and then reinstall it. Reusable air filters, such as an AFE air filter, are made of a washable cotton gauze material. As you probably know, cotton is one of the most durable materials on God's green earth.
  
<b>Save the Landfills. </b> In many states, disposing of trash is a big problem. You can do your part by not adding to the problem. Just think about it: over the lifespan of a car you could easily add 8, 10, 15 or more air filters and boxes to the city dump. With a reusable air filter, less is actually more.

<b>Engine Runs Better. </b> A deep pleat in a reusable air filter means better filtration: your car's engine "breathes" better with a higher quality, natural product. As you may know, an efficient engine uses less fuel too.

Sure, a reusable air filter will cost you more, approximately 2-4 times the price of a throw away air filter. However, you will recoup that money over time and do your part in showing environmental responsibility. Who can put a price on all of that? Go with green and make a difference today!
