The city of Pasadena, California may be a relatively small city (population under 150,000), however, due to it's proximity to downtown Los Angeles, the San Gabriel Valley and the San Fernando Valley as well as it's extremely popular "Old Town" shopping area and being the home of the Rose Bowl, it recieves a disproportionately large number of visitors every day.<br><br>
While the citizens of Pasadena enjoy an income that is well above average, there are numerous other areas surrounding the city, such as Encino, Flintridge, Glendale, La Canada, La Crescenta, San Marino, Sierra Madre, etc., where many of the residents also have disposable income high enough to be able to afford the purchase of fine antiques.<br><br>
