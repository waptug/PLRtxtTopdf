Bass Fishing Tips: Being Prepared

Whether you are on a new lake, or on one that you call home, the main purpose is to locate and catch as many fish as possible. Each body of water has an endless supply of different forms of structure and cover in a variety of depths and water conditions. You can use many types of fishing equipments to be able to get a lot of fish in a proper and legal way, so we need to take good care of our equipments used for catching fish. 

Here are some bass fishing equipment tips to be remembered:
 

•	Keeping your feet dry. Seal skin sox, a waterproof pair of shoe that can be worn in any shoe. It will help you a lot in putting your boat in a low lake that calls for a need for you to step in the water too push off, by doing this your feet will be dry all day. 

•	Keeping your rods good as new. It is nice to look at, especially when you always keep your rod clean. Just use a simple prep pad in cleaning the cork handles on the rod.  If the cork of your fishing rods is very untidy then it makes your rods look like hundred years older than it really is. Take a very light grade sand paper and sand the cork handles, you will find out that all the dirt will go away leaving you with a brand new looking fishing rod. Plus it will make your rod last longer.

•	Hi- tech basin. Handheld computer and organizers such as the palm pilot can be very helpful to the bass angler. You may be able to log conditions, creating your own checklist to avoid forgetting stuffs, and store the numbers of your new friends you’ve met along the way. You can also download map for your destinations and when you reach home you can easily access all the information to your home computer for future purposes.

•	 Being prepared. Always carry equipment and parts in the boat just in case some failures or problems occur.

•	Batteries. Always check if you have a good connection. Take care of your battery. Always bring a spare for emergency purposes.

•	Being organized. Instead of using a plastic filing box, and some hanging folders why don’t you just make an article and label them with general bass angling headings and file your articles as you finish them. Subscribing to a lot of fishing magazines and reading a lot of good articles will be able to help you for your future reference. You can put up a mini library that’s all about bass fishing.

•	Boat bearings. Many anglers forget to check their wheel bearings on their boat trailers. Every spring when you get your boat out of storage, always have your bearings checked. This could save you from a serious accident with your boat

•	Rod basic. The most accurate casting is accomplished when bait casting equipment is cast overhand. Bait casting gear is extremely well suited for "targeted" fishing. On some occasions placing a lure under a boat dock, under over lying limbs or between pontoon boats may be necessary. In this situation skipping a lure is ideal. A spinning outfit is perfect for this chore. Be versatile and be able to use both types of equipment.  

•	Graphite rods. The biggest killer of graphite rods is impact against a hard object. It may not break in that spot the day it happens but there will be a weak spot at that point. Keep this in mind when stowing rods for travel. If you are keeping them on the deck, strap them flush against the deck so that the parts of the deck aren’t rapping against it during travel. 

If you are storing them in a locker, do the same or put them in a horizontal holding system, where they won’t hit the side or floor of the locker. If you are the non boater and your partner doesn’t have room in his locker, try to find the spot that minimizes the repeated bouncing they will take if they are laid over the gunwale. If you have to, lay them over your leg when running the big engine. It's never fun to set the hook on a good fish and end up with a three piece rod
