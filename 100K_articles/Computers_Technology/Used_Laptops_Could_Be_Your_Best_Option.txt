Most people who want to purchase a new laptop look at brand new laptop computers. There are many used laptops available. Is buying a used laptop a good idea? It depends on where you look and what you need in a computer. Used laptops do not come with warranties and usually have no guarantee. However, if you are looking for a laptop for basic functions, this could be the way to go.

Most used laptop computers were sold so that the previous owners could upgrade to a newer model. Others are for sale because companies upgrade their computers frequently. In some cases, you can find top quality laptops at a fraction of the price. If you want to consider purchasing a used laptop, the first step is to make certain that you are buying from a reputable dealer. There are numerous dealers that sell used laptops online. Online marketplaces often do have larger quantities and set prices for their used laptops. Some may even offer limited warranties. If you choose this route, check into the dealer and the computer offer carefully before making a purchase. Most of these dealers sell computers that are good brands that have also been upgraded in some way. In all cases, a used laptop should have the memory completely erased and ready to go when you buy it. Many used laptops can be found on online auctions. This could be a risky way to purchase a computer. Prices for used laptops can vary greatly depending on the seller. If you are using an online auction to buy a used laptop make sure you ask the seller plenty of questions before bidding, and check their seller reputation on the auction site. Be wary of any seller that has poor seller feedback.
 
Another thing to consider when looking at used laptops will be if the computer has the ability to be upgraded. Make sure the laptop computer you are looking to purchase can have the upgrades you want. Older computers may have less memory and will need more memory to make it useful. If the asking price of a used laptop is low enough, buying more memory may not be cost prohibitive. Also, you will need to check to which types of programs are already installed on the computer. If you will have to purchase expensive programs such as a Windows program, you may not come out on top with the purchase. If you will need to access the internet, make sure the used laptop has the capability to do so. Some older models may not be able to access WiFi or a high-speed internet access without upgrades.

Before looking at used laptops, remember that these computers are not certified. If you experience problems, used laptops usually do not offer any type of warranty or guarantee. There is no guarantee of how long the laptop will work. Also, remember that used laptops may need repairs or part replacements. In addition, if you get a used laptop and have problems, you usually have no recourse with the seller.
