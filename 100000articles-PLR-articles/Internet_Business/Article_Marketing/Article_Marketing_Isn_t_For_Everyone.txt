Marketing with articles can take a lot of time, time not everyone has to spare.  It can used successfully for most businesses, but if you don't have a lot of time to spare, this may not be the method you choose.

It only takes a few minutes to write an article of 300 to 500 words.  It becomes a problem if you can't write.  If thios is the case with you, it is better not to use articles to market.

Hiring someone to write articles for you isn't always an option.  You must first find an author you can work with then find the money to pay them.  Most will seek immediate payment.  This may not be something you are prepared to provide.

If you are looking for ways to promote that cost little or nothing, you may try article marketing.  It has consistently proven itself as a very effective marketing strategy and shows no signs of that staus disappearing.

You can hire someone to write your articles and hire others to submit them for you.  If you have the money to do this, and it can be very affordable, then article marketing may be a good choice for you.

You won't know how successful you can be with submitting articles unless you at least try it.  Write an article.  The first ones always take more time but that changes with experience.  If the article is good you are on your way.

Now comes the submitting.  Try doing this yourself and see how it works.  Do you have the time it will take?  Are you willing to put in that much time?  If the answers are no, are you willing to pay a submission service to do this part for you?  The answers to this will help you decide if this method is for you.

Give article marketing a month trial.  Write and submit a weekly article during that time and see what happens.  By the time the month ends, you will have a good idea whether or not you want to continue with this endeavor.
