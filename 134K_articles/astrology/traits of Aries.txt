Traits of Aries
  
Aries is the first symbol of the Zodiac, the Ram.  This sign covers the Equinox, March 21st, and the beginning of Spring.  And Spring--with it's energy of rebirth, as winter ends and flowers bloom--is the perfect example of energetic and freedom-loving Aries. 
Aries people are just like Aries the Ram, and on fire like their planet, Mars.  They go after what they want.  With their confidence and spirit, they make natural pioneers, and unstoppable enemies in a fight against tyranny. 
People born under Aries are confident, intelligent, and enthusiastic.  They are driven to excel and achieve, and like nothing better than to gather and inspire a team to follow them on their quest.  They look forward, and don't dwell on the past.  They are also one of the most extroverted of all the signs. 
On the negative side, Aries must be careful of their weaknesses--selfishness, impatience, impulsiveness.  Aries will fight for what he believes in, but he will also fight to be "the alpha male," the leader of the pack.  They also tend to get caught up in starting projects without finishing them.  Never expect patience, tact, or diplomacy from an Aries, and be careful of their quick temper.  They can get so caught up in the quest that they don't realize the foolhardy mistakes they're about to make. 
Aries make excellent entrepreneurs; it's a natural talent for someone with such a strong focus on initiative and leadership.  They thrive on challenges and love to excel and win.  They don't react well when forced to wait, and can have trouble accepting advice. 
Aries is the first sign, the one that leads the Zodiac, and like their sign, those born Aries like to lead as well.  They would never be content leaving their adventurous quest for a quiet and dull desk job.
