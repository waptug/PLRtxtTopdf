<b>Things to consider before having your tickets Printed</b>

Before you start looking for the best way to produce your tickets it is best to spend a few minutes and collect the information about your event.  This information can include:
<ul>
<li>Event Title Information</li>
<li>Event Time, Date, and Location</li>
<li>Ticket Price and Number of tickets needed</li>
<li>Artwork or logos to be included on the tickets</li>
</ul>
This information will make it much easier as you proceed through the following steps of designing and printing your tickets and will give you a good idea of what exactly it is that you are looking for in your ticket printing endeavor.
There are three ways to easily and quickly produce event, general admission or raffle tickets, they are: 
<ul>
<li>Design and print tickets using an online form</li>
<li>Have custom tickets designed and printed by a professional for your event</li>
<li>Use ticket design and printing software to create your own tickets and then print them on pre-perforated ticket stock from your home or office printer.</li>
</ul>

<b>Design and Print Tickets using an Online Form</b>
Many online sites now offer pre-designed ticket templates that can be customized for your event.  TicketPrinting.com, as an example, has over 100 designs for different types of events.  Once you find a template that fits your event you can customize the tickets by placing the text that describes your event on your ticket, some templates will even allow you to upload an image or a logo to the ticket giving it even more of a custom look and feel.

The advantages of these pre-designed tickets are that they are less expensive than custom tickets; they have a quick turnaround time if speed is a requirement, and you are able to see the proof of your ticket immediately.

<b>Have Custom Tickets Designed and Printed by a Professional for your Event</b>
Companies are more than willing to help you design tickets for your event.  Most of them will even include the design as being free with your printing order.  With a professional ticket designer, you will talk directly to a person who will ask you about your event and what you would like the tickets to look like.  They will then create a ticket proof that you can approve before the tickets are printed.

Custom Designed tickets take longer than pre-designed templates do to process because of the additional design time, averaging 3 days to 1 week for the tickets to be printed.  They are also more expensive due to the fact that it you are also paying for more human interaction in the process.  The cost is worth it many times when you want a great looking ticket that matches exactly the theme of your event.  

<b>Ticket Design and Printing Software</b>
Printing tickets is possible with programs that are currently installed on your computer if you do not need any variable data, such as a ticket number or a seat number, but it is much easier and faster to use a program that is specifically designed to print tickets.  Most ticket editors have an easy to use interface that will allow you to drag and drop text, images, numbers and other items onto your tickets.  You can also buy pre-perforated ticket stock that is safe to use in any home or office printer providing a professional feel to your tickets.

This option is great if you know what you want your ticket to look like and if you trust your artistic ability.  The downside is that it often takes a fair amount of time to print the tickets and then separate them from the sheet that they are printed in.

There is no right or wrong way to have your tickets printed, but you will find that one of these options probably will fit you and your organization more than the others.  Once you decide how to have your tickets printed, you will be close to the end of your quest.

<b>Raffle Tickets</b>
Printing Raffle Tickets is not any different than printing event tickets in most cases.  While most raffle tickets have a detachable stub and space for the purchaser to enter their own contact information, the printing is the same as they require a serial number.  You will find that some Ticket Printing Companies will either print raffle tickets or event tickets.  These are generally smaller companies that print tickets on a pre-printed background that is set up to be raffle tickets or event tickets, but not both.  If you find a site that does not have what you are looking for, keep looking as most needs can be met by the major ticket printing companies.
