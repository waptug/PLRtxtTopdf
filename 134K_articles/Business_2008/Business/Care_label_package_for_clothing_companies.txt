Article Body:
The cost of producing care labels has fallen with the introduction of a care label printer, fabric and ink package from Paxar. The new Paxar 9830CL thermal printer has been teamed-up with a new dip-coated nylon fabric and a new thermal transfer ink.

The package is targeted at medium sized clothing manufacturers seeking low cost inplant apparel labelling. It is being promoted as a one-stop solution with the care tape, ink, ribbons, label and printer all being supplied by Paxar.

The company says the 9830CL is a robust and reliable low-cost-of-ownership solution with the emphasis on simplicity and flexibility, where labels can be printed as required.

The package calls for the minimum of operator training. It is simple to load, with easy flip-up access to the printhead should jams occur. Set up of the software is also said to be undemanding. Extra long care tape reels last longer and a new design of ribbon mechanism ensures the system is not plagued by ribbon wrinkle.

It prints high quality labels on to a wide selection of fabrics available from Paxar. Print speed options are 64mm, 100mm and 152mm a second with labels up to 102mm by 305mm that can incorporate a variety of barcode symbologies, including 2D codes.

The Paxar 9830CL is a 300dpi printer with a 102mm printhead width. It offers scaleable font, a battery-backed memory for format storage, serial/parallel communications ports and a 32-bit RISC processor for faster imaging time.
