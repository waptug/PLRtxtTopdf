Article Body:
Marc Jacobs is one of the youngest, hottest new designers and it is no surprise that his Web site displays the same fresh, sleek look that he is revered for by the Hollywood elite who wear his designs.

When you enter www.MarcJacobs.com, you are greeted with a choice of videos for his two main lines, Marc Jacobs and Marc by Marc Jacobs, and the ability to be front row at both shows. If watching the videos doesn't do it for you, then check out the other features of the site including the News & Gossip section that covers Marc's comings and goings in the press that are almost as fabulous as his clothes. Be warned though, parts of the site can be difficult to navigate as visual options come flying at you faster than the luxury designer can march clothes down a catwalk. But the beautiful creations more than make up for some minor navigational difficulties.

Marc Jacobs' collections are everything a luxury line should be, sleek sophisticated and cutting-edge. His original clothing line, Marc Jacobs, is flirty and flowing, yet manages to be simultaneously body-conscious. His more widely worn Marc by Marc Jacobs uses vivid colors and creative details to put his signature coolness stamp on traditional silhouette favorites.

When all is said and done, there is a reason Marc Jacobs is one of the best designers and is widely appreciated by all. The Web site is a great way to see behind the scenes of one the most widely anticipated fashion shows each season and view the luxury designer's most up-to-date collections of clothes for men, women and kids as well as housewares and other odds and ends, which is why I would definitely include it as one of my favorite picks.
