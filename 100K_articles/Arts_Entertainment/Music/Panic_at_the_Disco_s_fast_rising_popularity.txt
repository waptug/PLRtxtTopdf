Article Body:
Panic! at the Disco is a pop rock/electronica band based out of Las Vegas, Nevada.  The band is comprised of Brendon Urie (vocals, guitar, keyboard) and his childhood friend, Spencer Smiths (drums), along with their schoolmate, Ryan Ross (guitar, keyboard, backing vocals).  

To promote their music, the band made contact with Pete Wentz (of Fall Out Boy) via his LiveJournal webpage.  Impressed by the band, Wentz personally met with the band and signed them to his imprint label Decaydance.  Under the label, the band released their debut album, A Fever You Can’t Sweat Out, which would debut at #112 on the Billboard 200 album charts.  

Featured in Spin magazine as their band of the day in early October 2005, reaching #1 on the MySpace chart, and consistently staying in PureVolume’s Top 10 chart, would only help grow the band’s popularity.  An appearance on MTV’s TRL on January 17, 2006, at the premier of their music video for I Write Sins Not Tragedies, also helped garner the band much publicity.  

To date, the band’s 2005 debut album, A Fever you Can’t Sweat Out has sold over 750,000 units.  The band is currently headlining a North American summer tour with The Dresden Dolls and The Hush Sound, a band also signed to Decaydance.
