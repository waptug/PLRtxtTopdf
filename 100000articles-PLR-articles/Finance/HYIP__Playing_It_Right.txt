HYIP’s has been around for so long coming in different names and guises but no matter what, it has not failed to attract customers. The good thing about HYIP is that it can offer good returns for investments sometimes as good as 250% in one month. The bad news is, it has its sorry share of scammers. 

HYIP is probably one of the most exciting things happening online for people who are looking for ways to earn a good return for their money. Today, HYIP speculators can earn substantial profits for their investments. A HYIP may invest in properties, in stocks and in other HYIP. As these are good investments and people are flocking to it some HYIP programs are online to prey on potential investors. 

HYIP programs are getting more participants by the day and every so often another HYIP program is launched. Many investors have succeeded earning fortunes virtually overnight.

Just like any other venture, especially when these have very high returns, HYIP also involves high risks, Although for people who have done their homework and played it right, a HYIP can be extremely lucrative.

If you have participated in any high yield investment programs before, you will know that programs of this nature have its own large share of scammers and you know what it means to take caution. Even when HYIP is recommended to you by a friend who have visibly earned from the venture, even when respected people in the business and in the community have profited, there is still substantial reason to be cautious and to make very good back ground research. It is a part of a scammer’s strategy to make some people win to attract more. This is similar to dropping baits to be able to fish more. More often than not, it is the good unsuspecting guy that suffers. This is why when parting with your money, serious research is needed. No one has to feel pressured to invest as long as there is still that nagging discomfort that warns you to hold back.

Good or bad, here are some pointers to get some certainty on your investment:

- Any investing is a risk. Winning and losing is a part of the game. This is why many good investors will tell you to invest first the money that is not a part of your active income. Fight first against to urge of investing a fortune even when you are certain you could win. That could come and happen anytime. There is no rush and definitely there should be no pressure. Remember HYIP investing is like gambling. While there is good fun in winning big the first time, many people who felt so certain have also made devastating losses.

- Choose HYIP programs that has been conducting successful programs for months not those that have been conducting for more than two years and definitely not those who have been there for only two weeks no matter the returns on investments that it advertises. Then conduct a shortlist.

- Do not put too much egg in the same basket. Diversify.

- Keep on monitoring the programs that you joined. If one of the programs that you joined has been down 4 times during the month, pull out your investment.
