If you are looking to see what types of data entry and typing the internet has to offer, it is all at this site. As to traditional data entry work, most jobs consist of typing in names and addresses either into lists or databases. But honestly you will never make a decent income with typing and data entry work like this, even if it is medical transcription, word processing or typing statistical data into spreadsheets. The amount of money you can make with this type of work will be directly related to your typing skills and speed. If you are not a fast typist, and very accurate, then you have two choices, find a good typing course and practice until you can type 50-60 words per minute with very few errors, or find some other kind of internet work from home. With poor typing skills you will quickly get frustrated at how little you can earn, and the company supplying the work to you will probably be unhappy with the quality of your data entry work as well. All you need is access to the internet, have basic typing skills and follow the simple step by step system. There are software programs available such as Typing and Data Entry thatcan be used to learn how to enter data without having to go to formal classes.

This home based business, although it would probably start small, could be grown to virtually any size depending on the amount of work you were able to secure for your home based business.
