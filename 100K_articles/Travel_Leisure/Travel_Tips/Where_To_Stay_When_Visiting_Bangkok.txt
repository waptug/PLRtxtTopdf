Article Body:
It is the same as buying real estate.  The three most important things to remember are location, location and location.

If you will only be over-nighting in Bangkok, you may just want to stay at a hotel near the airport.  Traffic can be horrendous in Bangkok, and you don’t want to risk missing your flight.

If you are like me and want to get out during your stay in Bangkok, staying in the Sukhumvit Road area is the place to be.

I only stay in Bangkok when I absolutely have to but when I do I look for hotels in the Sukhumvit and Soi 4 area.  There are a few reasons for doing this:

- It is right in the heart of the action.  Bars are within walking distance and prices for the hotel are reasonable.

- There are numerous restaurants within a five minute walk. I can get Thai, American, Italian, and many more European and Asian dishes easily.

- If I do need to get a taxi, I can open the front door of the hotel and take about 3 steps and get a cab.

- When it is time for me to depart and head for the airport, I get a taxi and a short jaunt across Sukhumvit and we are on the tollway.  You don’t want to get stuck in Bangkok traffic when you need to catch a flight.

- Even though I speak reasonable Thai, it is nice that most of the stores and shops in the area speak a little bit of English.  It saves time and makes the shopping easier.

- Speaking of shopping, Sukhumvit is a mecca of street vendors.  Sharpen your negotiating skills and get all of your souvenirs at dirt cheap prices.

- Free breakfast.  I usually stay at the Majestic Suites Hotel on Sukhumvit between Soi 4 and Soi 6 (closer to Soi 4) and they have a basic free breakfast.

- I can book online.  There are many places to book hotels in this area using online booking which saves me time and money.

- Relatively safe. There is a police box right on the corner of Sukhumvit and Soi 4 if you need help from the boys in brown.

- Quiet.  Even though it is on a main road, and overlooks a bar complex, the hotels in the area are quiet

So you can see that for about $40 USD per night, you can get excellent value for your money.  You can go upscale a couple of blocks away and stay at the JW Marriott but I prefer value for my Baht.
