The topic of office furniture is about as exciting as watching the grass grow to some people. Generally, these people see buying office furniture as a necessary evil which requires them to search through the numerous offering of different manufacturers to finally find that perfect piece that they’ve been looking for. While the topic of office chairs and other office furniture items might seem a little dull to the new shopper, there are plenty of ways to make it exciting. Yes. Exciting! 

1) Let’s start with Ebay. Guess what? Ebay is one of the largest (if not the largest) shopping experiences in the world right now (and probably into the near future). Ebay has grown massively during the last and it currently the largest used car dealer on the planet. How does this relate to office furniture? Simple. Office furniture can be bought on Ebay. And cheaply. I regularly buy items for 50% off on Ebay. Maybe someone had a business that didn’t work out so well and now all their equipment is for sale on Ebay. Their loss is your gain. Why pay $800 for a new chair when you can buy one slightly used for $250? No brainer. Ebay is the way to go. 

2) Don’t buy more than you actually need. Office furniture is quite versatile. Buying a slightly larger desk can take the place of two smaller ones if you know how to arrange it properly. In fact, buying one large used piece of office furniture might cost only ¼ as much as 2 small new pieces. The key is to buy the best bang for the buck. 

3) Look into leasing or renting office furniture. Now this is one good tip- I’m sorry to say I can’t take credit for it myself. This is a fantastic way to keep your cash flow in your pocket while enjoying the benefits of a brand new office. New chairs, new desks, new everything: all for a very low up front price. The big thing to look out for here is to make sure that you are truly getting a good deal. To say there are conartists out there is a huge understatement. Read the fine print carefully and make sure that what you are paying is less than buying it outright. However, with a little bit of homework, it really isn’t that hard to get a good deal by renting or leasing. Check it out.
