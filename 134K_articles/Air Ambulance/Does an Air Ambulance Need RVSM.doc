}Does an Air Ambulance Need RVSM?\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 If you are
 someone you know will be needing to use an air ambulance service, there are numerous
 factors to consider before making the trip.  One factor to consider when flying
 in an air ambulance is the aircraft.  If the patient must travel by air over a 
distance of 500 miles, then it is advisable to transport the patient in a jet.  
Before selecting any air ambulance service that uses jets to transport their patients
, check to see if the aircrafts are equipped with RVSM.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 What does
 RVSM mean?  The letters RVSM are an abbreviation for Reduced Vertical Separation
 Minimum.  RVSM is a modification to the jet aircraft that has been required by 
the FAA on all aircrafts that want to fly above 29,000 feet in the air.  Despite
 the FAA regulation since January of 2005, many pilots have chosen not to make this
 modification to their jet aircraft.  Without RVSM, pilots are forced to fly their
 aircraft at lower altitudes.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 For personal
 flights, flying at lower altitudes is primarily a minor inconvenience, but when
 traveling for medical necessity by air ambulance, the situation changes.  Patients
 flying on an air ambulance jet are in need of comfort, safety, and speed.  The 
lack of RVSM requiring flight at lower altitudes compromises the patient\u8217\'92
s comfort and the speed of the flight.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 When a pilot
 is forced to fly at lower altitudes, the transit time is lengthened.  When time
 is of the essence, patients cannot afford to waste time.  Jets having RVSM are 
able to fly at higher altitudes and save precious time.  In some instances, this
 can make the difference between life and death.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Another negative
 side to flying without RSVM includes more fuel stops.  With each landing and takeoff
 for fuel, more time is spent circling the airport, taxiing, and fueling up the 
plane.  Waiting for more fuel can spend time that some patients don\u8217\'92t have
 to spare.  Selecting an air ambulance service that flies with RVSM can save time
 and offer patients and family peace of mind.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 More turbulence
 is frequently experienced at lower  altitudes when compared to flying with RVSM
.  Turbulence can compromise the safety of the patient.  This can be avoided using
 RVSM technology on the air ambulance flight permitting the aircraft to fly above
 the turbulence.  Choppy flights can also become uncomfortable and unpleasant for
 patients.  Selecting an air ambulance service that has RVSM on their jets will 
ensure the highest possible comfort for the patient.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Anyone traveling
 by air ambulance is undoubtedly concerned with safety, speed, and comfort.  RVSM
 may seem to be a luxury for some pilots, but quality air ambulance services know
 the value of RVSM for their clients.  The RVSM technology modification to aircraft
 allows the patient the utmost comfort possible during the flight.  Flying at higher
 altitudes saves considerable time, by avoiding refueling, extra touchdowns of the
 aircraft, and issues with turbulence.  Clearly, selecting an air ambulance jet 
with RVSM is important when traveling by air ambulance for long distances.  RVSM
 offers safety and convenience for passengers creating peace of mind during a stressful
 time.   \par}
