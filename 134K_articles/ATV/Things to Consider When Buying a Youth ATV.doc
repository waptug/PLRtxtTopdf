}Things to Consider When Buying a Youth ATV\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 There are
 many things to consider when buying an ATV for a child. You should first determine
 if the child is mature enough to ride alone and can follow safety precautions. 
If you think your child can handle the responsibility of an ATV, you must then pick
 the right one for them. The biggest and most obvious consideration when choosing
 an ATV for a child is size, although there are other important factors to consider
 as well.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 The size 
of your child will determine the size of the ATV you purchase. You will want to 
get the largest ATV they can comfortably drive so that it will last them until they
 are an adult and they will not outgrow it. Most ATV manufacturers make smaller 
models for children so be sure to inquire when you visit the dealership.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Safety is
 probably parent\u8217\'92s biggest concern when purchasing an ATV for their child
. While riding an ATV can be a great activity for a child, you need to make sure
 your child follows safety precautions and the ATV you purchase has all the necessary
 safety features. Most locals require riders under 18 to take a safety course before
 purchasing an ATV and this is always a good idea. You will want to consider how
 stable and powerful the ATV model is that your are considering purchasing.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 The engine
 size goes along with safety, as children cannot control an ATV as well as adults
. The more powerful an ATV is, the greater the chance for trouble. If you are unsure
 what engine type will be the most suitable for your child, most dealerships will
 have someone who can explain all the different engine specs to you. If you are 
purchasing an ATV somewhere besides a dealership, there is plenty of information
 online that will help you determine a safe engine type for your child.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Let\u8217
\'92s face it, even the most mature child is still likely to put more wear and stress
 on their ATV than an adult because they do not have as advanced driving skills. 
You want to make sure that the ATV you purchase for your child is reliable and maintenance
 is not complicated. If you buy your ATV from a major company at a dealership, chances
 are you will get a warranty and the ATV will be reliable. This is not to say that
 you cannot find a reliable ATV other places, but generally dealerships will have
 the best service and warranties after the sale. You should also take into account
 the cost of replacement parts for the ATV you buy.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 The last 
thing you should consider when purchasing a youth ATV is cost. Just like any other
 major purchase, you should shop around for the best deal and make sure you stick
 to your budget. Depending on how long your child will likely use a youth ATV until
 they move up to an adult model, you may be better off buying a used ATV and saving
 for a bigger model when your child grows up. \line\line\line\line}}
