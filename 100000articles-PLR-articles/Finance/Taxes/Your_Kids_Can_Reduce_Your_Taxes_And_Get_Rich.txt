One often-overlooked tax benefit for business owners is putting their kids to work in their business.  

If you are self-employed you can take advantage of this by paying your kids $4,000 each for performing services in your business. The business gets a tax deduction for the compensation and that saves taxes on the parent's tax return. Also, there is no Social Security or Medicare Taxes due on the wages you pay to your child.  

The next step is to open a Roth IRA for the child and contribute the $4000 to the IRA. The child may not withdraw this money until age 59 ½. The earnings and the amounts contributed grow tax-free and are generally never subject to tax when withdrawn. On the child's tax return, the child gets no tax deduction for the IRA but the child may not pay tax on the $4000if he or she is at a low enough level of income. 

If you do this for 10 years, from age 8 to 18, and the IRA earns an 8% return each year, your child should have around $1.5 million at age 60 and that should grow to over $2 million by age 64. 

If you plan to do this, consult with a professional tax advisor first and be sure your children are actually performing services for your business. Also, check that the work is not violating any child labor laws.
