It is hard to move or even travel internationally with some assurance that you will be able to talk to your loved ones on a frequent basis.  Thank god for international calling cards.  If you are moving to another country these may not be a use to you as you are probably able to get a reasonable plan from your phone company.  However if you are traveling abroad it can be difficult to get in touch with people in your home country.  Okay so most cities have internet cafes nowadays but if you are anything like me you like to hear your mother’s actual voice once in a while, not just to read her words on a computer screen.

So before you travel it would probably be in your best interest to investigate some international phone calling cards.  Now I have actually found a website on the internet-surprise surprise-that provides you with rate information on different calling cards, http://www.masterbell.com/.  For example I searched for information for calling Venezuela from the United States and the web page gave me 20 different calling cards. Now I would say this is a pretty thorough search.

From this information you are able to at least estimate how much it will cost your family and friends to get in touch with you.  All you have to do is reverse the search to find out how hard it will be for you to keep in touch with them.  

Now the hard part might actually be finding the calling cards with the best rates in your home town.  Well, aren’t you lucky, this website even allows you to order the cards online and to refill them?  It is amazing what you can do with the internet nowadays.  So, here you go, no more worries.  Finding international phone calling cards is like every thing else these days; as simple as searching on the internet.
