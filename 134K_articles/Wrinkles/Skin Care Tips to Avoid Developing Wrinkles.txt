It actually contains chlorine which can add to the risks of developing wrinkles fast. If this is the case, wash your face once a day. This way, you will be able to retain a good amount of moisture and oil on your skin.

2. In washing you face, use mild soap. Choose the brands that have moisturizers as part of the ingredients. Do not use soaps and even deodorants with alkaline. If it cannot be helped, just avoid it.

3. Choose a brand of moisturizer that is water based. After washing your face, use a clean and soft towel to pat your skin dry then add the moisturizer. 

4. The sun also contributes a lot in developing lines on your face. What you must do to counter this is to apply sunscreen when you are going out. This should be applied even you are only going to be exposed to the sun's rays for a short period of time.

5. The sleeping position can also contribute to slow down the process of developing the unwanted lines. You can try lying on your back when you are sleeping. But only do this if it will be comfortable for you. The effect of this act is that it will offset the gravity's effects. 

6. Avoid smoking. You are young and you may want to try it all. But this vice is really not going to do anything good to your skin. Plus, your health will also suffer through time. When are you going to quit? When people mistake you for a 40-year-old than the 20 something that you really are? You surely don't want to take that route.
