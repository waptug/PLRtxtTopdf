At some point in a vehicle's life, most women will have to take their automobile to a repair shop because it has, unfortunately, let them down. 

AAA, North America's largest motoring and leisure travel organization, is helping women motorists jump-start their awareness in automotive maintenance with a checklist they can use to boost their car care confidence and automotive self-reliance.

"If women put off visiting an auto repair shop because of fear, it could be a recipe for disaster," said John Nielson, director of AAA's Approved Auto Repair program. "The more you know about your vehicle and how it operates, the better." 

AAA offers the following tips for women:

* Become familiar with your automobile's maintenance schedule. This information is provided in the owner's manual of your vehicle.

* Don't wait for your car to break down to identify a repair shop. Be proactive and research where you want to take your vehicle when it's time to be serviced.

* Gather recommendations and opinions from friends and family about auto repair shops. This will help streamline the decision-making process.

* Check with local consumer agencies to identify if the repair shop in question has any unresolved disputes.

* Find out if the shop employs ASE certified automotive technicians that are experienced working on the type of car you own.

* Select an AAA Approved Auto Repair facility. These shops undergo an extensive investigation before being allowed to enter the program and AAA is confident that they will provide competent and professional repairs.

* Communicate your vehicle's symptoms effectively by using simple everyday language or demonstrating the problem during a test drive with the technician.
