Radios that can receive and transmit communications are known as 2 way radios. Some common examples are walkie-talkies, CB radios and even cellular phones. While these products are very different in nature, they are common in that they receive and transmit communication and are classified as 2 way radios.

There are many uses for 2 way radios, including a camping trip with the family where walkie talkies help everyone to stay in touch. When in the wilderness, a cell phone is not likely to have a signal and this is why walkie talkies are so helpful. If individuals should get separated from one another while camping, having a way to remain in communication is invaluable. In order for 2 way radios to work, individuals must be on the same frequency or channel to communicate. Before separating, families should make sure that everyone is on the same channel incase the devices are needed.

The uses of other 2 way radios, such as cell phones, are more obvious. Car problems while out on the highway can be a major issue unless you have a cell phone to keep you in contact with the outside world. In addition, landline phones often have problems and may be out of service temporarily. In many of these instances, however, cell phones are still operational and can offer a way to report the outage to phone companies, stay in touch with family and friends or make emergency calls if needed.

There are a number of places to find 2 way radios, including retail and specialty stores. The internet is also a wonderful way to find 2 way radios in a variety of styles, features and price ranges. Most electronics feature a manufacturer’s warranty when purchased new, so take note of any such offerings when browsing for 2 way radios. Warranties often last for 90 days to one year and cover repairs and/or replacements of any product that is defective as a result of workmanship or materials. It is best to keep any warranty information tucked away in a safe place for later retrieval.

As a final thought with 2 way radios, it is best to test the product before putting it to actual use. In other words, the best way to test a walkie talkie is not when you are already out on a camping trip. The best time would be before you leave home and always be sure to test the distance at which you can still communicate without any problem.
