b) Upgrade Version - more expensive than OEM but cheaper than a Full version. The license is transferable but you need to be upgrading from a previous Office suite to qualify, i.e. Microsoft Works Suite 2000, Office 2003 or Office XP.

c) Full Version - the most expensive version and hence, has the least limitation.
