Using the metasearch concept pioneered by the well-known DogPile, Excite or HotBob Search Providers, TripleMe provides web surfers the top ten organic results from the three major search engines on each page. Results display in a single-page side by side comparison allowing users to quickly find relevant links for the search string they entered.

From our view we noticed that TripleMe Search Engine supports search requests in all languages, netting a global reach where users anywhere in the world can easily search top results for Google, Yahoo and MSN. In addition, users can also perform local and global searches; something not currently offered with other metasearch engines.

TripleMe’s robust search features also give users spelling suggestions from the three different search engines and can list results for maps, pictures, books and more.

Though fresh off the press, this metasearch provider has incorporated many useful search features unavailable with providers like WebCrawler, DogPile or HotBob. It’s convenient, diverse, and really easy to use.
