The global demand for heavy construction equipment has increased dramatically over the preceding years. This demand of heavy construction equipment is highly accredited in part to the recovery from a recession in assorted Asian countries, as well as in Latin America, Russia, and Africa. Regardless of the fact that the heavy construction equipment industry is not as heavily concentrated as it had been in previous years, acquisitions are still going strong and substantial partnerships between competing companies are on the rise. 

As technical advances in the heavy construction equipment design and security help marketing efforts get ahead, the price increases have a tendency to remain modest in retrospect. This also speaks for all new, used, rented or leased heavy construction equipment alike. Each year the heavy construction equipment industry is meeting a global demand of turnout at about six percent each year. The heavy construction equipment industry has been sharing in the worldwide drive with a number of countries to construct new projects and to restore older public and private structures.

Heavy construction equipment mainly consist of the following main categories: mixers, cranes, loaders, trucks, tractors, graders and rollers, just to name a few, as well attachments and parts. All heavy construction equipment is used in a wide range of applications from major infrastructure projects to office buildings and from housing to factories, power plants and mining. The extent of use of heavy construction equipment is so broad that key measures in demographics, such as the population growth, along with ample growth in economics, are the main influence of the demand for heavy construction equipment in the world today. 

Projects that require the sporadic use of heavy construction equipment also call for significant amounts of capital investment. In privately funded projects, investors seem more receptive when interest rates are low and when there is a reasonable rate of return. Most public works programs are ventured upon during recession as part of a broader financial turnout. In developing countries, the rate of sustainable economic growth is a major concern as sporadic trends tend to be shorter and more under consideration in mature markets. This may influence a country's ability to attract external capital or to generate its own. 

Heavy construction equipment and its components can be manufactured in fewer locations to service the global market. Heavy construction equipment can now move without any obligation between mature markets, while some emerging countries still require exports to qualify for liberated imports.

Regions and countries vary widely in their demands of heavy construction equipment to perform tasks of building and re-building. The need for heavy construction equipment in these regions are more related to upgrade and maintenance of the existing infrastructure and buildings than it is to new projects. In other developing regions, the need for heavy construction equipment is used to build new projects such as highways, airports and urban buildings, etc. With a growing global demand of heavy construction equipment, the possibilities of building are endless.
