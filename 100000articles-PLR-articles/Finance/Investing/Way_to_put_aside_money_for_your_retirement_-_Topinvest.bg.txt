One of the easiest ways to start saving money for your retirement is to make use of common savings accounts. The accounts pay interest on the balance contained within, and as you add money to the account over the years the amount of interest paid will continue to increase. Some banks even offer specialized savings accounts to assist with retirement planning, which pay higher interest rates so long as certain deposit conditions are met.

Another way to put aside money for your retirement is to purchase certificates of deposit. These certificates pay interest over time until the certificate matures, at which time the entire amount built up within the certificate can be collected. Some certificates of deposit have a very short term, but others can last for years... these should be utilized as part of your retirement plans because relatively small investments can yield large returns when left to collect interest for several years.

A variety of investment plans, both private and employer-sponsored, can be a great way to help put money aside for your retirement. Common investment plans such as 401(k) plans and IRA's can be used to invest money in the stock market for collection upon retirement... though the stocks chosen for investment should be carefully considered so as to avoid losing money in the process. Some companies offer investment plans and stock options where the investments are chosen by the employee themself, though others require that the money for the plan is invested in stocks chosen by the company.

Though they are becoming less common in favor of investment plans, pension plans are another way that money can be set aside for retirement. With a pension plan the employee pays into the plan over the course of their employment, during which time the employer pays an additional amount (usually matching) into the plan. The money may be placed in a savings-type account, or held in escrow or as part of a money market account. Upon retirement, the employee is paid their pension either as a lump sum or as regular payments for years after they have retired from the company.
