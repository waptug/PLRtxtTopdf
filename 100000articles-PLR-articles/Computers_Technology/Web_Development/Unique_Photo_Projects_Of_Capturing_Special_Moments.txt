You don’t really have to be a professional photographer to be able to capture special moments with family on camera. If you have a digital camera and you know how to snap pictures at the right moment, you can already create some really interesting photo collection.

Getting Started

One of the most interesting photo projects that you could start is a creative memories collection for the whole family. This is rather an ambitious project especially if you belong to a big family but if you can easily pull this off with the help of the Hewlett-Packard (HP) Photosmart All-in-One products. The printing & amp, and digital imaging system, of HP is very reliable and easy to use so you do not have to worry of ruining your pictures.

To get started with your creative family memories photo project, create an outline of what you intend to include in your creative family memories photo project. You may include in your outline the family history, the special moments such as marriages and births and other memorable occasions. To complete your family history sections, find some old pictures of the family. Ask the help of other family members to locate old pictures of your grandparents. Never mind if these old pictures are in black and white. You can always enhance their appearance by editing and adding some features into these old pictures. Since most of these old pictures use films, you need to scan these pictures to translate them into digital images. If you have an HP scanner in the house, use that scanner to capture the images. In case where you do not have a scanner, you can use your digital camera to take a picture of the old photographs. You may latter on use your computer to edit the pictures that you have taken. Note that with the use of the right photo editing software, you can easily remove blemishes from old photographs and give these old pictures a more attractive look.

Aside from old pictures, you may also ask the help of your family members to gather some recent digital pictures of family activities. Select a few of these pictures and add them to your collection. You may classify these pictures and put them in different sections such as vacations, weddings, birthdays, graduation, job promotion and others. You may also create a special section dedicated sole for children. Children are always good subjects and they will add more drama to your photo collection. Adding a collage of pictures of children in the family in your photo project can be very interesting.

Once you have all the pictures that you need, you can now start writing labels and captions. Some funny comments here and there will prove to be very interesting indeed.
