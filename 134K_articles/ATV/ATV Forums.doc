\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\cf1\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 One of
 the best things about ATV forums is the wealth of knowledge available for people
 considering buying an ATV for the first time. If you want to get information and
 advice on which ATV is right for you but do not want to bother with the pressure
 of discussing it with a sales person, and ATV forum is a great place to go for 
answers. Community members are usually happy to give advice to new ATV owners and
 will answer all your questions about different ATV types and models. Best of all
, joining a forum is free and you have access to answers 24/7. Buying an ATV is 
a big investment, and can be quite costly. You can avoid buying a model with problems
 or one that will not suit you by consulting with experienced rides in a forum prior

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\cf1\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Another
 good aspect about ATV forums is that you can find out what ATV events and activities
 take place in your area. If you are looking for an ATV club to join or want new
 places to ride, ATV forum members will probably know what is available in your 
area, all you have to do is ask. You can also get advice on places to go for trips
 with your ATV and new places to explore. If you are looking for a race track or
 off road area open to the public, it can be hard to find this information locally

 be able to send you in the right direction.\par}
