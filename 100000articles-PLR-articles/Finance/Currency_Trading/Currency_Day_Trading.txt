The buying or selling of a currency within the same calendar day is known as currency day trading. In this case, all trades are completed in the same day and nothing is held overnight. The United States passed laws six years ago that enabled small investors and common men to participate in currency day trading; previously, only large banks and financial institutions and millionaires were engaged in the practice. 

Industry analysts believe that currency day trading is a well-kept secret of the rich and powerful who have the power to control all the banks, corporations and foundations throughout the world. In currency day trading, the traders have vast buying power. For instance, it enables traders to use $1 to control an investment worth $200, and $500 to control $100,000. 

The professional day traders are divided into two primary categories, those who work alone and those who work for a larger institution. Most of the traders work for a larger institution as they are given access to greater resources. Large amounts of capital and leverage, expensive analytical software, and a direct line to a dealing desk are some of the facilities given to the trader who work with big companies. On the other hand, individual traders mostly manage other people’s accounts or just trade their own. As these people have limited resource access, it prevents them from competing directly with institutional day traders. 

There is a lot of software with which a person can learn currency day trading practices. One needs to be a keen learner with an Internet connection. Websites such as Blackjack Trader.com, Choice Daytraders and CompuTrade are some of the portals through which a person can learn more about currency day trading.
