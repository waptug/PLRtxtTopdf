\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 There are
 many reasons that you may want to modify your ATV. If you want to improve performance
 or looks, or just customize your ATV you my be hesitant because you do not want
 to mess anything up. Or, you may be gung ho and have no hesitation about tinkering
 with your ATV. No matter which mindset you have, there are some things you should
 consider before modifying your ATV. You should do some research before attempting
 modifications and make sure you have a plan and know what to expect when changing
 parts.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 A great place
 to start your research is online. There are many websites and forums where you 
can get personalized advice. If you are not sure where to begin or have a question
 about a specific part, there are many people who will be willing to give you impartial
 advice in ATV forums. And it is free to join in the discussion. You can also find
 information on modifying your ATV on websites and even in blogs, so do a little
 research online before you start the work. If you do get stuck or make a mistake
, you can get solutions to your problems from ATV forums and learn how to fix your
 mistakes. Even a small mistake can turn costly, so make sure you get advice before
 you end up spending more than you have to.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 Sales people
 at you local ATV dealership or parts store can also give you advice, but you should
 be aware that sometimes they are more interested in making a sale. If you are not
 sure what you should do, do not let yourself get pressured into buying parts until
 you are sure it is the right course of action for you. Dealerships and part stores
 can be good sources of information but you have to be careful not to buy things
 that you do not need.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 You should
 always work on your ATV slowly and complete one project at a time. You can spend
 a great deal more than you intended to if you do not go slowly and you may even
 complicate your work by trying to change more than one thing at a time. You should
 plan out what you want to do and estimate what each part will cost and how long
 each part of the project will take. Then you will now exactly how much money you
 will need and how long the entire project will take.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28 You should
 always plan your modification according to your budget. While this seems obvious
, without a plan you may find yourself spending more than you can afford. It is 
important to price parts before you start so you know if your plans will fit into
 your budget. You mat be able to save money if you buy used parts or wait for a 
sale, so always investigate all your options. If you find that you cannot afford
 everything you want to do right away, save for a while and modify your ATV more
 slowly.\par}
