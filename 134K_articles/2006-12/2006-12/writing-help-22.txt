One resource that offers writing help is the various writing magazines and books that are available at your local book store.  No matter what kind of writing career you are interested in pursuing there is a book or magazine that focuses on your genre.  Books that are genre focused can be very helpful as they offer advice specific to that market.  One should not ignore the books that offer more general writing help though.  Topics such as grammar, researching markets, and working with editors are beneficial to any writer, no matter what genre they choose to focus on.

If you are looking for help with writing a novel, there are many writing groups online that will provide advice from professionals that will guide you along your journey.

Getting community feed back as your novel progresses is encouraging and  can help you if you are in a rut.
