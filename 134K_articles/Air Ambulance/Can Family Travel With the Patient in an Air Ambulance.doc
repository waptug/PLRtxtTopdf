}Can Family Travel With the Patient in an Air Ambulance?\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 When a loved
 one is dealing with serious medical conditions, everyone wants to help and be supportive
.  The family of the patient wants to be involved and informed about what is going
 on.  Just like the doctors and medical staff, a patient\u8217\'92s loving family
 wants what is best for the patient.  When the patient must be transported, many
 issues of concern arise.  If a loved one must fly in an air ambulance, can someone
 from the family come along for support?\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 The goal 
of transporting the patient is often to reach qualified healthcare quickly and conveniently
.  This is especially true for many patients whose lives are dependent on the speed
 in which they get to the appropriate hospital and treatment.  In some cases, the
 patient will fly in an air ambulance just a short distance to a local hospital, 
in other cases, a patient may travel across the globe for medical services.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Each specific
 case is looked at individually.  There is no one right answer to this question.  
In some cases, it is imperative to the patient that they only travel in the air 
ambulance with the medical staff.  Frequently, this is due to space limitations 
in the aircraft.  For example,, if the patient has just been involved in a severe
 car accident and must be air lifted to a trauma hospital in a helicopter, there
 may not be adequate room aboard the aircraft for the medical personnel to properly
 care for the patient if another person is seated in the area.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 On the other
 hand, if the patient must fly long distances for medical treatment, larger jet 
aircrafts may be more suited to the medical mission.  If this should be the case
, chances are high that there will be the necessary room for a member of the family
 to accompany the patient safely while en route to the destination.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Doctors, 
medical staff, and family all know that the patient is more relaxed when they can
 travel with someone they know and care about.  For this reason, whenever possible
, accommodations for a support person are made during the trip in an air ambulance
.  Of course, if the medical mission is compromised by the addition of another person
 into the cabin, for any reason, family members will be asked to refrain and meet
 the patient at the destination by using other forms of travel.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 During this
 stressful time, all efforts are made to make the patient the most comfortable and
 relaxed as possible, while keeping safety as the top priority.  If someone wants
 to accompany the patient on the air ambulance to the destination, by all means, 
ask.  If it is feasible, the medical staff will welcome the family member aboard
 the aircraft.  If the request is denied, take heart that the decision was based
 solely on the safety of the patient and the flight crew.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs20\kerning28 Travel by
 air ambulance can be a complicated issue, but the mission is to safely get the 
patient from the point of origin to the destination as quickly as possible.  In 
some cases, patients are not permitted a support person during the flight, but whenever
 possible, a family member is encouraged to travel with the patient.  \par}
