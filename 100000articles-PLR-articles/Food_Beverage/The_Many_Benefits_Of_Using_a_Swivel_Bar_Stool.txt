Bar stools are manufactured in various different styles and designs. When you are buying a bar stool or bar stools you should look out stools with swivel seating. Depending on how you would like to use you new bar stools, having swivel seats for a number of reasons a better choice.

The largest motive for choosing swivel bar stools is ease of use. A swivel bar stool will in most instances beat a static bar stool hands down for comfort and versatility. However, when you really want to use bar stools with swivel seats, you're stuck if you only own those with stationary seats.

In bars and restaurants, swivel bar stools make good business sense. You want everyone who visits your bar to be as comfortable as possible and to feel very relaxed when they are in company or entertaining. Placing the swivel bar stools with stationary bar stools forces them to physically turn round in the stool in order to converse with people in their company sitting in all direction. 

A swivel bar stool makes life easier and at the end of the day keeps your customers very happy and everyone knows that when a customer is happy they will return time and again.
For those people who work sitting in stools a swivel seat is a very good idea. 

Not only does it provide extra convenience when reaching for stuff and equipment, it is far more comfortable when sitting for great lengths of time. When sitting on the same stool or chair for any length of time we tend to move about a lot, this is what is called a conditioned response (something we do without even knowing it. This is far harder in a static bar stool, and can even lead to aches and pains especially in the back.

Smaller swivel stools are an excellent addition to an office environment. If you are in an area of the office that is easy to put your hands on everything then it would be far easier to just slide over or use the swivel motion to grab what ever you need. Likewise, using the phone, fax, or printer will no longer require standing up and moving.

The name of the game with swivel bar stools is handiness. Swivel stools or swivel bar stools make a lot more sense for many of the uses you face at work or for your business or even at home and most of the standard swivel bar stools cost more than those ordinary bar stools with standard seats.
