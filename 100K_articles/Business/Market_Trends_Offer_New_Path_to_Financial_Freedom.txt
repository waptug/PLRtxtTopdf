Article Body:
With the specter of an economic downturn - and possibly a recession - clearly on the horizon, it's understandable that people are anxious about their financial security and that of their family members. As the rates of unemployment tick upwards, people begin to wonder whether or not their jobs are secure and, if not, what they can do to protect themselves and their families. As a result, there is increasing urgency to look at market trends and find the best path to independence and financial freedom. 

To this end, many people are looking for ways to earn a second income, or to lay the foundation for a fallback plan should they lose their primary source of income. Others have decided that their future financial prospects are bleak, and that they need to embrace an opportunity that will enable them to get back on their feet. Still others have ridden the wave of past market trends and have found financial success, and are ready to jump on board the next opportunity that will enable them to reap tremendous rewards - in the form of residual income - over the years to come. 

High Demand Services

Success with any opportunity - whether it is related to cause marketing or is a home business - is predicated upon the need for high demand services. These are services that will be necessary even in the face of an economic downturn or recession. Just as electricity, natural gas, and telephone services were the "must-haves" of decades past, the high demand services of today and tomorrow revolve around technology. Specifically, the high demand services will be those that counteract the deleterious effects of the Information Age - namely identity theft and computer problems. 

It's inarguable that identity theft is a serious problem; after all, more than thirty people have their identities stolen every minute. And, while personal computer ownership is at an all-time high, most people simply don't know how to keep their personal computers safe and secure. Services that will take care of each of those problems are positioned to rack up unprecedented sales in the months and years to come - regardless of the state of the economy. Indeed, as more people rely on computers and the Internet to earn their livings, their need for such services exponentially increases. 

Best Chances of Success

The people who are best positioned to reap financial rewards from these market trends come from a variety of backgrounds. For example, information services professionals and hobbyists would do well, as would those with experience in sales and marketing. Those people who already own a sole proprietorship could easily add these kinds of products to their websites and begin earning immediate and residual information. 

Where to Look

If you're interested in taking advantage of the latest market trends, you need to partner with a company who is as eager for you to attain your goal of financial freedom as you are. To that end, select a company that has a proven track record, has a generous compensation plan, and that can provide you with a turnkey business system. When you do, you can help protect your personal finances from the economic ebb, while positioning yourself for true wealth.
